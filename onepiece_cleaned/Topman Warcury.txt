Saint Topman Warcury
is a
World Noble
and one of the
Five Elders
who publicly head the
World Government
,
holding the title of
Warrior God of Justice
.
Due to his actions and role, he is one of the secondary antagonists of the
Egghead Arc
. Along with the other Elders, he is one of the main antagonists of the
Final Saga
and one of the overarching antagonists of the
One Piece
series.
Appearance
[
]
Warcury is a bald elderly obese man who has a very large white mustache as well as birthmark spots on his forehead and right cheek. He wears a black suit over a black tie and a white buttoned shirt, as well as black pants. In the anime, he initially had a short white beard, but lost it after the timeskip.
Personality
[
]
Like the other Elders, Warcury cares about the balance in the world maintained by the
Three Great Powers
and wishes to maintain it. He appears to be patient, as he was content to observe
Shanks
' potentially threatening actions and not rush to intervene. However, he cursed
Crocodile
and
Monkey D. Luffy
for threatening the balance when the latter removed the former from the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, saying that Luffy could not be forgiven.
He also wishes to preserve the image of the
World Government
by keeping the events of the
Void Century
a secret, and he and the other Elders will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it.
He appears to take positions of authority seriously, as he disapproved of
Admiral
Aokiji
going off on his own without telling anyone.
Like the other Elders, he has little tolerance for people of lower rank challenging their authority, as shown during the Elders' meeting with Marine Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
instead of threatening or making hostile moves towards the fleet admiral, but Warcury was especially abrasive toward Sakazuki, reminding him of his place and failures by mentioning how Aokiji had joined forces with Blackbeard.
He takes rebellion very seriously and said the annihilation of the Lulusia Kingdom could serve as an example to other unsettled governments.
Compared to the other Elders, Warcury has appeared to display shreds of conscience regarding the lives of others. When Imu ordered for the Lulusia Kingdom to be annihilated, Warcury brought up the fact that the kingdom was heavily populated; however, he had no qualms about going through with it once Imu reaffirmed the decision.
He also seems to value racial harmony, as he was displeased to hear of
Jinbe
's resignation from the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, which had maintained bonds between
humans
and
fish-men
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a member of the Five Elders, Warcury is one of the few to have the "highest authority of the World Government", being above even the
World Nobles
.
He has control over every facet of the World Government, including the police, the Marines, and Cipher Pol, and even the Fleet Admiral of the Marines is incapable of challenging his power.
As a result, he has authority to declare a
Buster Call
, and he and the other Elders can use their great degree of power to manipulate the media and withhold facts from the general public, including erasing entire segments of history, most notably the Void Century.
Warcury, along with the other Elders are endowed with total authority over the
Pacifista
and
Seraphim
(above even their creator, Dr.
Vegapunk
's, though due to Vegapunk's secret meddling, their authority over all Kuma-formed Pacifista is second to
Jewelry Bonney
). The only known person who seems to outrank the World Nobles is
Imu
.
Warcury has tremendous willpower, remaining conscious from
Joy Boy
's
Supreme King Haki
released by
Emet
, which was powerful enough to knock out every Vice Admiral in a huge range.
Unique Powers
[
]
As one of the Five Elders, Warcury has demonstrated some esoteric abilities. Which of these, if any, stem from his
Devil Fruit
is currently unclear:
Warcury appears to have some form of telepathy, at least with his other Elders. The Elders were able to communicate with Saturn who was as far away as Egghead, while they were at Mary Geoise.
Warcury arrived on Egghead by being summoned through a "
Magic Circle
"
(
魔法陣
,
Mahōjin
?
)
on the ground as if through a portal; said circle had a pentagram in its middle and five number 3s in-between its jags. It is unclear if Warcury can make use of these portals on his own as Saturn did when he arrived on Egghead, or if Saturn's presence is required to invoke the portal.
At least in his
Zoan
form, Warcury can heal from injuries. He recovered instantly from having Saturn's explosive projectiles rebounded back at him, with
Luffy
describing him and the other Elders as being immortal,
as well as being punched with a full-force punch breaking one of his tusks, having it later regrown.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Warcury's Awakened Beast Form.
Warcury turns his tusks into blades.
Warcury acquired the power of a
Mythical Zoan
-type
Fengxi
(
封豨
,
Hōki
?
)
Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a fengxi and a human-fengxi hybrid at will; in his full Beast form, he resembles a four-tusked boar demon of gigantic size, even almost being bigger than a giant's ship. Warcury appears to have "
awakened
" his ability while maintaining his personality, as indicated by the ribbon of dark, flaming smoke around his shoulders and torso when he is transformed.
In his full boar form, Warcury can unleash incredibly strong,
Haki
-infused roars.
For direct offense, he can convert his tusks into massive blades and, being surprisingly nimble despite his massive size, can somersault through the air to slam his bladed tusks into his opponent.
His massive size grants him equally immense strength, allowing Warcury to bulldoze through whatever is in his path and preform powerful tackles capable of sending the
Iron Giant
flying.
Additionally, Warcury's transformation grants him a tremendously hard and durable hide. Not only could he withstand a point-blank "
fire fist
" from
Sabo
without trouble,
Luffy himself remarked on Warcury's toughness after punching the Elder with
Gomu Gomu no Red Roc
and hurting his hand doing so, while Warcury remained unfazed
(by comparison, that same move had been able to breach
Kaidou
's bodily defense, which is a feat that only a rare few can accomplish).
Later on, Luffy once again hurt his hand striking the Elder with a Armament Haki-imbued giant fist while assuming
Gear 5
, a form where all his physical capabilities are at their strongest. It is also worth noting that Gear 5's awakened ability to turn organic material into rubber was somehow negated.
So far, the only one capable actually harming Warcury was the colossal
Iron Giant
, who struck Warcury with enough force to break one of his tusks and cause him to bleed.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Like the other Elders, Warcury possesses powerful Haki. His arrival on Egghead was accompanied by a massive burst of Haki which resembled black lightning.
Supreme King Haki
[
]
Warcury mixes his Haki with a powerful roar.
Warcury is one of the very few people in the world who wield
Supreme King Haki
. He is able to unleash it in large-scale bursts with a powerful roar in his Beast Form. This specific employment of Haki was strong enough to disorient the
giants
Dorry
and
Brogy
, affect
Luffy
's
awakened
body in a rather bizarre manner, and knock unconscious several
Marine
soldiers that were many kilometers away.
Observation Haki
[
]
Warcury is a very skilled user of
Observation Haki
, as he was able to sense
Luffy's
and
Bonney
's transformations into
Nika
.
Weapons
[
]
Warcury carries a
flintlock
, which he intended to use to execute
Nefertari Cobra
for seeing Imu.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
As recognition for his genius inventions in
MADS
,
Dr. Vegapunk
was invited to
Mary Geoise
for an audience with the
Five Elders
.
Twenty-two years ago, the Five Elders spoke via
Den Den Mushi
to Professor
Clover
, an
archaeologist
from
Ohara
who was revealed to have been studying the
Poneglyphs
. Clover revealed that he knew too much about the
Void Century
, causing the Five Elders to order the
Cipher Pol
unit on Ohara to eliminate him and for a
Buster Call
to destroy Ohara and its historians.
Less than fourteen years ago (over ten years since
Gol D. Roger
's execution),
Spandam
persuaded the Five Elders to give him the authority to seek out the blueprints for
Pluton
.
Sky Island Saga
[
]
Jaya Arc
[
]
A Marine came to the Room of Authority to report that
Shanks
had made contact with
Whitebeard
. Although the prospect of two of the
Four Emperors
meeting was dangerous, Warcury said to observe the situation first without rushing to intervene. The Elders then talked about finding a replacement for
Crocodile
's
Warlord
position, and cursed Crocodile and
Monkey D. Luffy
for causing this kind of trouble.
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Long Ring Long Land Arc
[
]
The Five Elders got a call that Marine
Admiral
Aokiji
had gone off on his own, and Warcury disapproved, stating that Aokiji needed to mind his rank.
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
The Five Elders received a report that Shanks had successfully met with Whitebeard himself, to their shock.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Post-War Arc
[
]
The Five Elders talked about the aftermath of the
Summit War of Marineford
, with Warcury stating that
Jinbe
's resignation from the Seven Warlords was a blow toward racial harmony between
humans
and
fish-men
. They then talked about
Blackbeard
's rise to power, and Warcury stated that the pirate had a clear head start in the race to fill the Emperor position formerly held by Whitebeard due to having consumed two
Devil Fruits
.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
came to the Room of Authority to question the Five Elders about why they let
Donquixote Doflamingo
use the
World Nobles
' authority to misinform the entire world. The Elders reminded Sakazuki of his place and reprimanded his insolence, with Warcury reminding him about former admiral Aokiji joining forces with Blackbeard. A Marine then came in and revealed that Luffy and
Trafalgar Law
's alliance had taken down Doflamingo, and that their victory had been broadcast to the entire world, shocking the Elders and Sakazuki.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Levely Arc
[
]
Warcury and the other Elders bow before the real supreme leader of the World Government, Imu.
As the
Levely
was beginning, the Five Elders were approached by Shanks. Because of his position, they reluctantly allowed him to talk to them about a certain pirate, and Warcury ordered for all the soldiers to leave the Room of Authority.
After meeting with Shanks, they headed toward the
Empty Throne
, and talked about how King
Nefertari Cobra
of
Arabasta
had requested to meet with them. Upon reaching the Empty Throne, they knelt before its occupant
Imu
as they requested that Imu tell them the name of the "light" that needed to be extinguished from history.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
The Five Elders are attacked and ambushed by Sabo.
Shortly following their meeting with Imu, the Elders granted Cobra the audience he requested at the Empty Throne. Cobra brought up his ancestor,
Nefertari Lili
who was one of the
First Twenty
founders of the
World Government
. When Warcury asked what his point was, Cobra explained how Lili disappeared following her decision to abdicate living in Mary Geoise; he asked if the Elders had any records of what became of her. The Elders claimed to have no answer for this, and Cobra then asked about the meaning of the initial
D.
, revealing to the Elders' shock that a letter from Lili had been passed down through the Nefertari Family. Imu then entered the room and sat on the Empty Throne, and the Elders were shocked at Imu's decision to be revealed to Cobra.
Imu talked with Cobra about Lili and the D., and the Elders drew flintlocks as they intended to execute Cobra for seeing Imu. Imu was the first to strike Cobra, but then along with the Elders was attacked by
Sabo
using
Hiken
. Following the attack, the Elders and Imu transformed into beastly forms and pursued Sabo as he fled the room with Cobra. Following another strike by Imu, Cobra sacrificed himself to allow Sabo to flee and was promptly killed; the Elders then noticed that
Wapol
had been spying on the affairs in the room through a small peephole.
Following the Levely's conclusion, the Five Elders were in the Room of Authority discussing
Sabo
and the growing issues with
Vegapunk
on
Egghead
when they received a call from Imu, who wished to test out Vegapunk's
Mother Flame
invention; Warcury noted that the results of this test may affect how they would handle the Egghead situation. Imu told them to test it on the
Lulusia Kingdom
, and Warcury quickly noted that it was highly populated, but Imu disregarded this and Warcury said an example could be made out of them due to their recent stirrings of rebellion. Imu also gave them the command to find and seize
Nefertari Vivi
.
They later discussed the
Raid on Onigashima
, namely the orders they had given to capture
Nico Robin
and prepare to have the Marines assume control of
Wano Country
in the aftermath of the battle. The topic of the
Gomu Gomu no Mi
, which legends purported to be the "Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika" came up, and Warcury dismissed the existence of the latter as just a legend; however,
Ju Peter
retorted that there must have been a reason it was renamed centuries ago.
To avoid the fruit, which had been consumed by
Monkey D. Luffy
, awakening, the Five Elders commanded
Guernika
to interfere in the battle between Luffy and
Kaidou
to eliminate the former. Guernika sacrificed himself to allow Kaidou to inflict a deadly blow on Luffy.
Warcury berates a marine about Luffy's new bounty poster.
The Five Elders' attempt to eliminate Luffy proved a failure, as they later came to learn that the Gomu Gomu no Mi had indeed been awakened and Kaidou and Big Mom had both fallen in battle. Because Wano's borders were not opened as was initially expected, the Elders called off the Marine invasion but maintained the order for Robin to be captured.
Warcury called the marines and ordered that they remove the D. in Luffy's bounty poster and change the image on the poster as well because the Elders did not want the world to see Luffy's
Gear 5th form
, but it was too late as new posters were already being distributed across the seas.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
One Piece Film: Red
[
]
The Five Elders watched
Uta
's concert in
Elegia
from the
Den Den Mushi
. They discussed about Uta being the daughter of Shanks, a serious threat that was opposed to the Great Pirate Era, and how to stop her rebellion. Warcury was most concerned that the people were on the side of the diva and was all for nipping her potential revolution as soon as possible. Though there was some hesitation among them to carry out her elimination when
Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro
brought up that she may be related to the
Figarland Family
. Also, they were very concerned about Uta's connection with
Tot Musica
and they could not afford to be cautious if she summoned that as a threat. The Five Elders were the only ones who didn't fall asleep to Uta's powers as they already muted her songs. They were later informed by Lucci about an estimate being 70% of the world's population would be pulled into
Uta World
.
The Five Elders, horrified, witnessed Uta turning everyone including
Saint Charlos
into inanimate objects. As they couldn't afford more casualties, they had to make a decision even if a Celestial Dragon would get caught in the crossfire. They witnessed Tot Musica, finally summoned by Uta, attacking the Marine ships. After Tot Musica was defeated by Luffy and Shanks, the Five Elders witnessed Uta releasing everyone from the Uta World through singing.
Concludes non-canon section.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
Having received Imu's orders, the Elders then received a call from
Marine Headquarters
revealing they had traced Sabo to Lulusia, and the Elders took note of this stroke of fortune as the Lulusia Kingdom was completely annihilated by the Mother Flame soon afterward and declared to never have existed in the first place by the Five Elders.
The Five Elders also received a call by
York
, who was aspiring to become a Celestial Dragon, that Vegapunk was doing forbidden research on the Void Century and decided to send a squad of CP0-Agents to assassinate Vegapunk and all his satellites, including York.
Following Saturn departing to Egghead, the remaining elders in the Room of Authority were contacted by York again. While their conversation was overheard by Saturn and
Kizaru
, York asked them why they intended to kill her as well, with Marcus Mars replying she was still a Vegapunk after all. Upon the elders negotiating a deal with her, York revealed that she needed saving from Luffy before he kills her, much to Warcury's shock.
The Five Elders confront Luffy.
As the
Egghead Incident
went on, the situation did not play into the World Government's favor. Vegapunk had been successfully eliminated by Saturn and Kizaru, but his death triggered a global broadcast that would reveal much of the World Government's top secrets to the entire planet. Warcury and the other Elders were unnerved by the very idea, and eventually contacted Saturn to summon them all to Egghead in order to stop the broadcast before it could be completed.
Saturn complied with their request, with Warcury and his fellow Elders able to successfully touch down on Egghead by means of a Magic Circles. All Five Elders stood transformed in unison against Luffy, before going off on their separate tasks. Warcury, Saturn, and Ju Peter, all fought against Luffy while their fellow Elders took care of other matters.
Warcury is knocked away by Dorry and Brogy.
To the detriment of the Elders,
Dorry
and
Brogy
arrived and rescued Luffy from
Shepherd Ju Peter
. After they signaled their retreat, Warcury quickly moved in to stop them. Warcury used his powerful
Haki
to disorient the giants, before leaping at them. Warcury turned his tusks into blades, and attempted a strike on the giants, although they blocked using their shields. The giants then counterattacked by bashing Warcury with their shields, sending him flying back over to Saturn. Saturn attempted to shoot Venom at the giants, but Luffy deflected it back at them, causing a massive explosion. Moments later, Warcury and his fellow Elders recovered without issue.
After Luffy stopped Ju Peter from sucking everyone into his mouth, Warcury charged at Dorry, Brogy and Luffy, with Luffy attacking him to stop his charge, only to hurt himself due to Warcury extremely tough hide.
Warcury then took a moment to telepathically converse with the Elders about Vegapunk's intention behind his broadcast and its possible difference from
Clover
's message as well as being informed about Mars failing at stopping the message. Later, when the countdown from the message was down and the message fully started, Mars pondered if they could afford to destroy the Power Plant, to which Saturn replied they can afford the loss of all their forces in and around Egghead but Warcury added that the one thing they couldn't afford losing would be the Power Plant, as losing it would mean that no one could create the Mother Flame anymore.
Warcury continued to charge after Luffy, Brogy, and Dorry igniting fires throughout the area, Luffy went to attack him only to hurt himself again.
Warcury attacks the Iron Giant.
Upon receiving York's theory of the true location of the Broadcast Den Den Mushi being within the
Iron Giant
, Warcury abandoned his pursuit of Luffy's group in favor of stopping Vegapunk's broadcast. When the Elders (sans Nusjuro) reconvened around the Iron Giant, they came to the realization that it was the very same machine that had attacked Mary Geoise 200 years prior. After hearing Vegapunk begin to make his announcement on the meaning of the letter "D.", Warcury wasted no time in moving in and ramming the Iron Giant, resulting in the broadcast cutting out, and the machine falling into the sea.
Wishing to continue with their success, the Five Elders moved on to the next most pressing issue: killing off the remaining Vegapunks. After figuring out the locations from York, each of the Elders proceeded with their new task. Whilst Mars got a lead due to his flight ability, Peter and Warcury quickly made their way toward the coastline in order to target Atlas, the Giants, Bonney, and the Straw Hats.
Warcury is punched by the Iron Giant.
Eventually, after arriving at the coast, Peter would be dealt with by Luffy, leaving Warcury the ability to freely move past him. Warcury proceeded to leap from the coastline, aiming to crush the Giant's ship. Moments before he could hit however, the Iron Giant reemerged from the ocean and punched Warcury, breaking one of his tusks in the process.
Despite the hefty damage, Warcury made a quick recovery. He stood aside as Peter took on the machine, with his fellow Elder being successful in managing to bite off one of its arms.
Warcury and the other Elders are forced out of their transformations.
A little later, Warcury went on the offensive again, ramming the Iron Giant once more to cause further damage. Despite being on its last legs, the machine had one last trick up its sleeve. Before it could be finished off, the Iron Giant untied a knot somewhere on its body, releasing a massive burst of Haki that was sealed within it by
Joy Boy
. The Haki was potent enough to force Warcury and the other Elders out of their transformations, before sending all but Saturn back to Mary Geoise.
While the remaining Elders waited for Saturn to return, they were instead surprised by
Figarland Garling
entering the Room of Authority, seemingly without their approval. While admonishing him for his lack of respect, they became shocked when he announced he was appointed as the new Warrior God of Science and Defense, replacing Saturn as one of the Five Elders as he took the seat that his predecessor once sat on.
