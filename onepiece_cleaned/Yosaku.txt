Yosaku
along with
Johnny
are old friends and former
bounty hunting
partners of
Roronoa Zoro
.
He is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Baratie Arc
and the
Arlong Park Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Yosaku has a black shirt with a green coat and red headgear. He has plaid yellow boxer shorts over unshaven legs and dark shoes and, like his partner, carries a sword. He is also sometimes seen with a cigarette.
After the timeskip, Yosaku is no longer wearing the coat and is seen shirtless, showing he has a kanji tattoo that reads "Big Catch"
(
大漁
,
Tairyō
?
)
on his back. His arms have become very muscular.
Personality
[
]
When he is with Johnny, the pair often stand together side by side, with one arm across the chest and the other at their mouths. While like this, their voices and behavior become serious, however in truth, they are very silly and emotional. Yosaku is the more emotional of the pair and he can spend hours crying over stories of difficult times and struggles. He tends to get frustrated and even upset when no one pays attention to him when talking. Like Johnny, he has a fair amount of knowledge regarding rumors and the world but lacks the finer details. He was partly blamed by Zoro for their misinformation over "Hawk-Eyes" and "Drunk-Eyes".
He prefers to avoid danger like Johnny, but unlike Johnny, he quickly forgets his fears if distracted by something else like food
or by being moved by a story linked to the fear. When he is spurred on, he is brave enough to go against
Arlong
and his crew and wise enough to know that if they did not stand a chance against Arlong and his crew the villagers they made suffer would be slaughtered. One quirk he shares with Johnny, perhaps out of pride, is always stating that any fight he loses, he lost only by a hair.
Relationships
[
]
He is
Johnny
's best friend. Both
swordsmen
respect and admire power, as proven by their constant praising of Zoro's power, and later the
Straw Hat Pirates
power. Anyone who has earned their respect will be acknowledged by them as "Aniki" (brother) or "Aneki" (sister).
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Yosaku is a swordsman like
Johnny
, however they are relatively low in strength and power. As for example when they tried to take on the
Arlong Pirates
by themselves they were easily overpowered.
He and Johnny are inexperienced with traveling by sea as proven when Yosaku fell ill to
scurvy
. However, he and Johnny are fairly knowledgeable about the world at large, such as information on the existence of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
and the Arlong Pirates; he even identified Momoo as a
Grand Line
monster upon first glance when the Sea Cow confronted the boat that he, Luffy and Sanji were on, hinting some degree of experience.
They are, however, still incompetent and have been known to slip up, as when they reported
Hawk-Eyes
had been reported at the
Baratie
when it was actually "Drunk-Eyes".
Weapons
[
]
Further information:
Nakiri Swords
Yosaku wields one of the two Nakiri Swords. It is a sword, that resembles a dadao, with a red handle and a circular tsuba. The blade of the sword gets broader as it gets farther away from the hilt. He does not appear to own a sheath for it, as it is shown being hung on his waist with a piece of looped cloth rather than a sheath.
History
[
]
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Past
[
]
A few years ago, Yosaku and
Johnny
were in a bar when Yosaku pointed out that the
man
behind them was worth
5,000,000. Hearing this, Johnny recommended that they don't do anything, to which Yosaku complained that they cannot simply go after small-timers. A few seconds later,
Zoro
walks into the bar and asks for food, saying that he will pay for it by claiming a bounty. Billy hears this and charges at Zoro, the act of which throws Yosaku and Johnny into panic. After Zoro quickly takes out Billy, Yosaku searches the wanted posters to see if he is a criminal. Johnny then asks if he could be the pirate hunter that has been making news lately, but Yosaku replies that it cannot be since the pirate hunter uses three swords, whereas the man in front of them only has one. Johnny and Yosaku then got up to confront Zoro about stealing their prey, but is ignored by the latter. Zoro then asks the two if they have heard of "Hawk-eye"
Mihawk
and explains that he only claims bounties to feed himself on his journey to become the greatest swordsman. Yosaku laughs at this goal, but Zoro explains that he has already made up his mind. Afterward, Zoro tells the two that they can keep the bounty and prepares to leave.
After claiming Billy's bounty, Yosaku celebrates but notices that Johnny appears to be feeling down. Johnny asks Yosaku why he became a bounty hunter, to which he replies that it is so that he can eat. Yosaku then explains that he wanted to be like the bounty hunters that defended his village from bandits and, upon hearing this, Johnny comes to the revelation that he too wanted to be like them as a kid.
Seconds later, they heard commotion coming from town and find out that
Dick
and his gang were attacking. They then arrive at where Dick was pillaging and watched alongside the townspeople. When Johnny wanted to help the
kid
that fighting Dick, Yosaku suggested against it, but could not hold Johnny back. After confronting Dick, Johnny proclaimed that he wanted to be a champion of justice, which surprised Yosaku. Hearing this, Dick laughed at them, but the two replied to his laughter by telling him that they had turned in someone worth
5,000,000 just that morning. Dick then stopped laughing and revealed in anger that he was Billy's sworn brother.
Yosaku and Johnny are then easily defeated by Dick. They then revealed that they were only the ones to claim Billy's bounty, but that someone else had defeated the bandit. After hearing Dick call them weak, they charged at him, but flung backwards with a single punch. Dick then prepared to finish them off with his bazooka, but they are saved by Harry interrupting. Dick then prepared to leave, but the two of them swore that they would take him down or die while trying. They are then attacked by Dick's gang and bruised till the point that they cannot get up. Dick's henchmen then prepared to finish the two off, but they are saved by
Zoro
. Zoro then asked to borrow their swords to steal their prey again, and it is only then that they realized that he was the pirate hunter. After Zoro, easily defeated Dick's henchmen, the two watched in surprise. Likewise, their surprise continued as Zoro defeated Dick and then the two asked Zoro if they could join together, to which the latter accepted.
Concludes non-canon section.
At some time in the past Yosaku met and partnered with Johnny with whom he worked as bounty hunters. At some point of time Yosaku and Johnny met and befriended Zoro.
East Blue Saga
[
]
Baratie Arc
[
]
Yosaku was resting after getting contact with
scurvy
when
Usopp
and
Luffy
unknowingly shoot at the tiny island they are on for target practice, injuring him. He was later taken on board where
Nami
was able to diagnose and treat him. This incident proved to be helpful for the Straw Hats, as it made them realize the importance of finding a cook for their crew to avoid any food-related seaborne illnesses since Yosaku only got sick from eating rotten fruit. The two help the Straw Hats with that problem by directing them to the
Baratie
.
As they were near the Baratie they noticed a marine ship. Yosaku and Johnny attacked
Fullbody
for insulting them, but were defeated. During the Baratie arc Johnny
and Yosaku remained on the
Going Merry
to rest and they noticed Nami's interest on their collection of wanted posters. As
Dracule Mihawk
arrives at the Baratie, Nami tricked Yosaku and Johnny and escaped with their treasure and boat.
She had them drop their guard by pretending she was changing her clothes and asking them to turn around. With their backs turned, she pushes them off the Going Merry and stole the ship.
After explaining what happened to Luffy, the two witness Zoro being defeated easily by Mihawk,
before Johnny and Yosaku leave with Usopp and the wounded Zoro to pursue Nami.
Through means that are still unknown, Yosaku later returned to the Baratie in the mouth of a wild
panda shark
shortly after the
Krieg Pirates
left to pick up Luffy, explaining that Nami was headed to
a dangerous place
and they needed his help. After
Sanji
agrees to join Luffy's
crew
, the three departed to Arlong Park.
Arlong Park Arc
[
]
While on the way, Yosaku explains the story about how when
Jinbe
agreed to become a
Warlord of the Sea
, a
World Government
-recognized pirate, his former comrade
Arlong
had founded
his own crew
and had been sent into the
East Blue
as part of the agreement. Yosaku even clearly stated that Jinbe set Arlong free to East Blue in exchange for his seat as a Warlord of the Sea. This resulted in Arlong terrorizing the East Blue, and built his own place Arlong Park which is their current destination, since both he and Johnny were able to figure out that Nami was heading there due to both the direction of the ship and that Nami's earlier behavior was related to Arlong, because of her obsession with Arlong's wanted poster.
Yosaku and Johnny block the Arlong Park entrance.
Once Luffy and Sanji defeat the Arlong Pirates' pet
Momoo
, they are able to use it to tow themselves to Arlong Park to get there faster.
However, after recognizing that the Straw Hats will try to win Nami back by defeating Arlong, the two decide to back off and retreat out of fear for their own lives.
But once they hear
Nojiko
's story about Nami's tragic past and why she had to join Arlong, the two attempt to face Arlong's crew for having misjudged Nami only to be easily defeated. Recognizing that only the Straw Hats can defeat Arlong and his crew, Johnny and Yosaku stop the villagers from throwing their lives away.
During the battle, Yosaku, along with Johnny lend Zoro their swords to replace the ones that Mihawk broke at the Baratie so he could defeat
Hatchan
. After Arlong's defeat, they thank the Straw Hat crew for their assistance but continue their life as bounty hunters.

Johnny

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
