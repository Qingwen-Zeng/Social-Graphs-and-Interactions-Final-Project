Drum Island Arc

Luffy and Usopp mistake Maria for a Hiking Bear.
When the Straw Hat Pirates were searching Drum Island for a doctor with the help of
Dalton
, they met Maria in the village of
Bighorn
.
Luffy
and
Usopp
mistook her for a
Hiking Bear
and bowed to her as she approached. Maria had heard the news of the arrival of a group of pirates and was worried by it since the country was previously destroyed by the
Blackbeard Pirates
' raid. She asked Dalton if everything was alright, which he confirmed.
That day was her eldest son's birthday and she wanted to bake an onion cake for celebrating, so she was out looking for onions. The second time she appeared, she informed
Dalton
that
Dr. Kureha
was in the next village. During that occasion, she had many more onions in her basket.
