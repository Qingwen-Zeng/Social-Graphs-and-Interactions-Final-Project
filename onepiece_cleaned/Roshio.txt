Ironically enough, Roshio himself got brutally attacked by

His
Jolly Roger
represented a silhouette hanging from a rope, which says a lot about his bloodthirsty and angry behavior.

Sky Island Saga
[

Jaya Arc
[
]
Roshio played cards with
Bellamy
the Hyena. When Roshio won the hand, Bellamy accused him of cheating and stabbed his hand, trying to force him to admit to cheating. Roshio continued to deny the accusation, so Bellamy questioned his own crewmate
Sarquiss
on the matter. Sarquiss also claimed to have seen Roshio cheat, which greatly angered Roshio. Before he could do anything, however, Bellamy shot him a couple of times and smashed a bottle of alcohol on his head. Giving him no time to react, Sarquiss quickly threw a lit match at Roshio, causing the alcohol to light on fire and knocking him out of the top floor of the building they were in.
Bellamy then leaped down and finished Roshio off with the
Spring Hopper technique
.
Despite claims that he died from Bellamy's attack, Roshio had actually survived and eventually recovered.

Roshio watches Vegapunk's broadcast.
Two years later, while in Mock Town, Roshio watched
Vegapunk
's worldwide broadcast. While most of the crowd mocked Vegapunk's claims, Roshio held a stern expression, likely because he took them seriously.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The scene wherein Bellamy accuses Roshio of cheating is different in the anime:
Bellamy stabbing Roshio's hand in the manga.
Bellamy seizing Roshio's wrist in the anime.
Originally in the manga, when Roshio attempts to take his winnings, Bellamy pins down Roshio's hand to the table with a knife. After asking
Sarquiss
if he saw Roshio cheating, Bellamy then shoots Roshio in the leg and hits him with a bottle filled with alcohol. With Roshio covered in alcohol, Sarquiss throws a lit match on him and sets him ablaze. The ignition throws Roshio out the window.
In the anime, the scene is toned down due to its violent nature. When Roshio attempts to take his winnings, Bellamy grabs Roshio's arm and crushes it as Roshio denies that he cheated. Later after asking Sarquiss if he saw Roshio cheating, Bellamy shoots Roshio several times and kicks him out the window, presumably using his
Devil Fruit
ability
. Afterwards, Roshio's crew was shown down in the streets trying to carry him away to get some much-needed medical attention, before Bellamy jumped down and finished him off.
