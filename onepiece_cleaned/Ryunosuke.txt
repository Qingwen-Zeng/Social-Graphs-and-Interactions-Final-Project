Ryunosuke
was a "Rising Dragon"
(
昇り竜
,
Nobori Ryū
?
)
created by
Kurozumi Kanjuro
using the power of the
Fude Fude no Mi
. It was created to aid
Kurozumi Kanjuro
,
Kin'emon
,
Trafalgar Law
, and the
Straw Hat Pirates
in scaling the leg of
Zunesha
to reach
Zou
,
and received its name from the Straw Hats.
Appearance
[
]
Ryunosuke was a large pink eastern dragon. Due to its poor composition, it had some physical traits which differed notably from actual eastern dragons, namely the head being indistinct from its body like a worm, a tail resembling a beaver's, and a pig-like snout; Kanjuro's comrades had initially guessed the drawing as a worm, snake, or lizard before it was brought to life. It possessed scales on its body, and a row of rounded spikes along its back. Its legs were extremely short, impeding its mission to climb.
Personality
[
]
Like other drawings brought to life by the
Fude Fude no Mi
, Ryunosuke was very loyal to the commands of its creator, and thus was determined as possible to complete the task of carrying people up
Zunesha
that it was given, despite the great strain on its weak form. After completing its journey, Ryunosuke displayed agency of its own as it smiled with joy at its success and the
Straw Hats
' jubilation.
Relationships
[
]
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Ryunosuke was created to help the Straw Hats, along with
Law
and the
samurai
, get up to
Zou
. Ryunosuke gave everything it had to do this for them, and they came to recognize its effort, causing them to get a fondness for the dragon and name it.
Robin
in particular was very attached to Ryunosuke as she thought it was cute. After completing its mission, Ryunosuke smiled at its success before fading away. The Straw Hats were distraught at the loss of Ryunosuke, except for
Zoro
and Law who viewed Ryunosuke as nothing more than a bad drawing.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Ryunosuke possessed the ability to carry people and climb on
Zunesha
's skin as it was designed for. Due to being poorly drawn, however, Ryunosuke was rather weak and struggled to just survive, let alone carry people up Zunesha. However, with encouragement from the Straw Hats, Ryunosuke persisted long enough to climb all the way up the elephant, though the exhaustion from this effort caused it to revert back to drawing form immediately following this.
History
[
]
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Zou Arc
[
]
Ryunosuke was drawn by
Kanjuro
on the deck of the
Thousand Sunny
and immediately brought to life with the power of the
Fude Fude no Mi
. The dragon attached itself to the leg of the massive elephant
Zunesha
, and Kanjuro,
Kin'emon
,
Trafalgar Law
, and the
Straw Hat Pirates
got on its back for it to take them to the island of
Zou
atop Zunesha's back.
At some point in the climb, the
mink
Bariete
came falling down and knocked Kanjuro and Kin'emon off the dragon's back, and the Straw Hats initially wanted Ryunosuke to climb down to retrieve them. However, upon seeing how exhausted the dragon was, they decided to let it keep climbing. A good deal of time passed, with Ryunosuke continuing to climb despite its distress. Zou back eventually came into view, and the Straw Hats loudly cheered on the dragon to finish the climb, at this point dubbing it Ryunosuke.
Ryunosuke finished the climb, and smiled as the Straw Hats celebrated their arrival. It then reverted back to drawing form and lost its consciousness, leaving the Straw Hat group (save for Zoro and Law) in tears.
Nico Robin
collected some flowers and placed them on the painting's resting place.
The next morning, Kanjuro, Kin'emon, and Bariete rode up on Torasaburo, and afterward, the tiger drawing laid down next to Ryunosuke.
Manga and Anime Differences
[
]
Ryunosuke's climb was extended in the
anime
; in particular, two filler scenes were added. In the first one, Ryunosuke slipped shortly after starting the climb and slid back down to the Sunny, managing to catch itself before falling in the
ocean
. Later, right before finishing the climb,
Luffy
went to sleep and fell off the dragon's back. Luffy then grabbed onto Ryunosuke's horns, causing its forelegs to detach from
Zunesha
as its body bent back, holding on only by its hindlegs. However, with encouragement from the Straw Hats, Ryunosuke was able to muster enough strength to pull its upper body back to Zunesha's leg.
