Gedatsu's Accidental Blue-Sea Life
[
]
While Goro and Gedatsu were digging around for the hot springs, Gedatsu stumbled upon the Dirt Boss.
He attempted to attack Gedatsu, but was easily defeated and so became a subordinate of the former sky priest.
He then kept digging and succeeded in helping Goro and Gedatsu in find water underground.
Afterwards, he kept digging until he suddenly landed in Arabasta, and with that he created a tunnel that would connect the two islands.
