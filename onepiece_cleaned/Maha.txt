Maha is taller and slimmer than the other agents. He has a light colored mask with round eyes, a cylindrical mouthpiece that sticks out, a high hat, and a long holding stick that he grasps with both hands in front of himself. His hair is green and wild. Like most CP0 members, he wears a white suit and cape.
Personality
[
]
Like most of CP0's agents, Maha is professional and prioritizes his missions above all else. Maha takes the
World Government
's reputation very seriously, declaring that the fugitive
Who's-Who
must be eliminated.
Though he later compared the World Government to pirates, after hearing that they plan to annex
Wano
if
Kaidou
is defeated.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Maha's overall abilities remain mostly unseen. However, the fact he wears a mask puts him among the top operatives of CP0, according to
Nico Robin
.
During their pursuit of Robin, Maha and
Guernika
defeated various powerful individuals present at
Onigashima
, including numerous
Mink
warriors,
as well as easily defeating
Zanki
(one of the
Numbers
) alone
and facing off one-on-one with
Izou
(albeit wounded), a former commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, until a mutual defeat.
Physical Abilities
[

Maha displayed a great degree of stamina and endurance, showing no signs of exhaustion after multiple battles. He also dove through
Kazenbo
and emerged unscathed, despite being engulfed in flames in the process.

History
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
In the
Flower Capital
, the
CP0
agents Maha,
Guernika
, and
Joseph
negotiated with
Shogun
Kurozumi Orochi
about the new supply of weapons to the
World Government
after the arrest of
Donquixote Doflamingo
. Due to Orochi's surreal demands, CP0 was unable to agree to his terms.
The CP0 agents monitor the raid on Onigashima.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, the three agents stayed in
Onigashima
's guest room and used a
Go board
to track the forces during the
raid on Onigashima
.
Maha questioned why Guernika brought up that
Vegapunk
had extracted the
Lineage Factor
from
Kaidou's Devil Fruit
and created an
Artificial Devil Fruit
since the explosion on
Punk Hazard
had destroyed the lab.
When the battle turned in favor of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
, Maha claimed that either side's victory was irrelevant to them and commented that
Who's-Who
's death needed to be confirmed. Maha reasoned that leaving a fugitive was a precedent they could not allow to happen, but his companions assured him that Who's-Who would not survive his battle with
Jinbe
.
Maha and Guernika find and pursue Robin.
After hearing about the events of the battle that took place and seeing how little by little the numbers of the rebels were assimilating those of their enemies, Maha and the other two agents received priority orders through
Rob Lucci
to capture
Nico Robin
,
whereupon Maha and Guernika immediately left their room in order to search and arrest her.
Both agents ended up finding Robin and
Brook
somewhere in the second floor and began to give chase, defeating countless warriors of the
Mink Tribe
who dared to get in their way to slow them down.
Maha and Guernika are confronted by Drake and Apoo.
The chase led both agents to the basement as they got caught by surprise by
Kazenbo
, who engulfed them in flames, although they emerged unscathed.
Scratchmen Apoo
took the opportunity to photograph them with the intent of revealing their connections with
Kaidou
to
Morgans
. Intending to keep their business secret, CP0 confronted both Apoo and
X Drake
, the latter whose
true identity
they knew.
Apoo quickly fled the fight leaving an outmatched Drake and
Zanki
against the government agents, as Maha noticed the longarm deserting the battle. Immediately after that, Joseph called and informed them about the great defeats produced on Kaidou's side, as well as the massive implications that a loss from the Four Emperors would mean to the current state of the world.
Maha and Izou defeat each other.
Shortly after,
Izou
dropped down from the floor above and landed near the CP0 agents. The agents were willing to ignore the
Whitebeard pirate
despite the conflict of interest, but Izou refused to let them pass.
Despite being outnumbered, Izou fought the two agents, ending with him and Maha simultaneously knocking each other out. This resulted in Izou's death, and Maha's status remains unknown.
