to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi

He eventually joined the
Beautiful Pirates
, serving under
Cavendish
.
He is an ally of
Luffy
during the
Dressrosa Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Suleiman has straight, blond hair under a large black hat (decorated with a white skull and gold wings in the anime, mostly gold-colored with white accents in the manga), which covers one of his lilac colored eyes; it also has three bird-feathers. He wears a large black coat (dark purple in the anime) with a pointed collar, a pair of military medals, a pair of grey pants (black in the anime) and a pair of dark grey heeled boots.
He has a scar that goes across the center of his face.
Personality
[
]
He appears to be a stoic yet patriotic man. Despite being an exiled war criminal, he claimed that he still loves his country, even wearing his naval uniform despite his exile severing his connection to his home.
He also seems to be sympathetic to those who had the same predicament, as he asked Rebecca how she is able to live in a country that despised her and her family, and he later joined a pirate crew whose captain was also exiled from his home country.
Unlike most of the people who were freed by Sugar's curse, Suleiman is not shown to be swayed by greed, as he chose to fight the Donquixote Pirates instead of assisting them.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being recognized as a class A war criminal, his combat skills are presumably quite high. Likewise, he is confident enough in his abilities to enter the
Corrida Colosseum
competition for the
Mera Mera no Mi.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Suleiman is a highly skilled swordsman, being capable of keeping up and even overwhelming
Rebecca
in a one-on-one duel.
Still, like many other fighters, he cannot match
Hakuba
or
Dellinger
's sheer speed, having been defeated by both through very quick attacks.
History

Past
[
]
Sometime in the past he was involved in the
Sea Battle of Dias
and became a war criminal.
After he was exiled from his country, he roamed throughout the underworld as a
mercenary
.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Suleiman entered the
Corrida Colosseum
to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
. For the battle royale, he was placed in D Block.
As D Block's battle royale began, Suleiman was seen preparing to fight.
Suleiman later fought against
Rebecca
. He claimed that he did everything for his country and loved his homeland. He then asked her how she could cope living in a country where she is despised so much.
Suleiman and the rest of D Block are defeated by Hakuba.
Rebecca continued to evade Suleiman's attacks, but their fight was interrupted when
Cavendish
suddenly stood between them. They then saw Cavendish suddenly fall asleep and when several gladiators took the opportunity to attack him, his alter-ego, Hakuba, took control and proceeded to strike down all the remaining fighters in D Block. Suleiman fell victim to his attack and laid defeated on the arena.
Suleiman was later
transformed
into a
toy
and forced to work in the underground trade port. When
Sugar
's curse broke, the toys returned to their original forms. Suleiman was among the former slaves praising
Usopp
for freeing them.
After
Doflamingo
trapped Dressrosa in his "Birdcage", Suleiman and the other colosseum fighters escaped to the surface through an opening created by
Pica
when he rearranged the land with his
ability
.
When he found
Luffy
,
Zoro
, and
Law
, Suleiman stated that he will defeat Doflamingo. Therefore, he joined forces with Luffy's group alongside the
Chinjao Family
,
Hajrudin
,
Ideo
,
Ucy
,
Blue Gilly
, Cavendish,
Abdullah
,
Jeet
,
Orlumbus
,
Elizabello II
, and
Dagama
. When some of the former toys came for the heads of Luffy, Zoro, and Law, Suleiman and the allied colosseum fighters fought them off. They later marched towards the royal palace and began to battle against Pica.
When Pica attacked,
Chinjao
and Elizabello II shattered his stone hand, enabling the group to move forward. Suleiman and the other allied fighters fought through Doflamingo's troops. Pica then attacked with his other arm, causing Suleiman and some of the other allies to fall back. After avoiding Pica's strike, they were surprised to see Luffy, Zoro, Law, Abdullah, Jeet, and Ucy climbing on Pica's arm. They were also amazed when Luffy shattered Pica's stone head. When Pica's giant stone body stopped moving, Suleiman and his allies continued on with their assault.
With Zoro fighting Pica and
Sabo
fighting the
Marines
, the colosseum fighters charged up the new King's Plateau and easily defeated the
Donquixote Pirates
' troops standing in their way.

On the second level,
Dellinger
confronted Suleiman and began to mock him. As Suleiman stood, watching the strange pirate, Dellinger launched himself at Suleiman, knocking him down and impaling him with his horns.
Suleiman and the other gladiators defeat the remaining Donquixote Pirates.
During the final phase of Doflamingo's game, Suleiman and the injured gladiators were temporarily
healed
by
Mansherry
. They later defeated the remaining Donquixote Pirates on the New King's Plateau to help the citizens flee from the shrinking Birdcage.
With
Bartolomeo
's
barrier
, the gladiators worked together to push the Birdcage back just long enough for Luffy to defeat Doflamingo. After the Donquixote Pirates' downfall and the collapse of the Birdcage, the gladiators rested at the palace.
Three days after Doflamingo's defeat, Suleiman and the other gladiators prepared to assist the Straw Hats' escape from Dressrosa when the Marines were mobilized to pursue them.
As the Straw Hats made their way to the eastern port, Suleiman and his fellow gladiators stood in the way of the Marines that were chasing after them.
The fighters later gathered at the eastern port, preparing to fight
Issho
. When Issho prepared to attack them with all the rubble from Dressrosa, the fighters and the Straw Hats quickly fled to the escape ship. At that moment, Luffy arrived and attacked Issho.
During the clash, Issho used his gravity ability to blow away Luffy, who was then caught by Hajrudin. The fighters and Straw Hats quickly fled across a bridge leading to a gigantic ship in the distance. Issho prepared to drop the rubble on them but was obstructed by the Dressrosa citizens who were pretending to chase after Luffy. They eventually reached Orlumbus' flagship, the
Yonta Maria
. After boarding the ship, Suleiman announced that he had joined Cavendish's crew. The
Beautiful Pirates
was then one of the seven groups that pledged their allegiance to the Straw Hats.
After the Straw Hat fleet was formed, the Straw Hats and company held a feast to celebrate their victory over Doflamingo.
After Cavendish received Luffy's vivre card, the Beautiful Pirates parted ways with the Straw Hats.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
When the participants in the Corrida Coliseum are listed, Suleiman clearly appears instead of his single silhouette like in the manga.
He officially introduces himself to her and when Suleiman confronts Rebecca, Rebecca uses her technique, but to no avail. Her duel drags on: the criminal disarms the girl, but when he is about to hit her, Acilia intercepts her blow, only to be defeated later by him. While in the manga it is Hakuba who does it.
As Pica throws his giant punch, the group ascending the royal plateau hears the shock wave and the members laugh when they hear the pirate's voice. They then continue to argue over who will defeat Doflamingo.
Suleiman then watches Dellinger's movements and realizes that he specializes in kicks.
He is also shown regaining strength from him, as well as the scene where he and Luffy's allies defeat Doflamingo's last subordinates.
In the eastern port he is among those attacking the marines.
