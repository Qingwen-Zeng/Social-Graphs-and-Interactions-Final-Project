Ulti
is
one
of the
Tobiroppo
, the six strongest Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates.
She is the elder sister of fellow Tobiroppo
Page One
.
Due to her actions and role, she is a supporting antagonist in the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Ulti is a young woman of relatively tall height,
with a light complexion. Her hair reaches near her mid-back and forms rounded locks mainly blue in coloration, but with thin, pink-colored streaks running through (plus a single white one over her left eye). Blunt bangs fall on her forehead, split near the left, and an ahoge stands up on her head. Characteristically (as with many of her crewmates), Ulti has horns: a sharp, upward-curving pair emerging from the sides of her head, white in color, that resemble a bull's. Ulti's eyes are large, round, fringed by long lashes, and encompass pinkish-violet irises. Her lower face up to the nose is covered by a pink mask with a scalloped edge, trimmed with a white stripe;
Ulti keeps this mask even when she assumes her
pachycephalosaurus form
. When in her Human-Beast Form, Ulti's bangs are pushed back, exposing her forehead.
Otherwise, Ulti takes to wearing a long-sleeved minidress that is white and pleated above the waist, with a blue bow below a point collar. The dress's lower, light-blue, and non-pleated section, with a button placket in the middle, ends in a short skirt part that has a slightly ruffled hem, leaving most of Ulti's legs visible. Fastened on her shoulders is a darker-blue cape trimmed with light-blue fur on its edges (the inside also blue), which goes near the ground, and her footwear are red high heels.
Personality
[
]
Ulti is a bold, rude, and short-tempered young woman, not one to back down from a verbal quarrel and regularly threatening violence against those who annoy her. Somewhat fickle, she is shown acting friendly and trying to come off as refined, mature one moment, then yelling whilst dangerously blunt the next. Not even the likes of
Queen
or
Kaidou
, both her direct superiors (and the latter of whom most crew members seem at least somewhat afraid of), are safe from her vitriol, implying that she does not fear them at all, even to her fellow Tobiroppo's shock. Also, Ulti has no issue with generally acting in a highly casual manner towards Kaidou, expressing loud, girly glee during their reunion.
Ulti hits Tama.
Ulti is merciless towards enemies and willing to brutalize them without hesitation.
She is also not above hitting a child if annoyed, as seen when she clawed at
Tama
for begging her to stop hurting
her friend
.
In battle, due to her aggressive nature, Ulti is quick to attack anyone she deems an enemy. Still, she remains a quick decision-maker and keeps her guard up continuously, as shown when she set upon and seemingly crushed
Monkey D. Luffy
in their first clash. Rather than gloat and let down her guard like the grunts around her, Ulti instead kept track of him using
Haki
, quickly transforming and readying for further combat upon sensing Luffy's own Haki.
Ulti has a somewhat vengeful streak. She tends to grow extremely angry over, and swear to get payback for, enemies hurting her
or her brother,
Page One
,
even when the responsible party is much stronger than Ulti, like the
Emperor
Big Mom
.
Despite her childish bearing, Ulti can be smarter than she lets on. In the past, she managed to steal
two
Devil Fruits
from Kaidou to give to herself and her brother, thus giving them the strength necessary for them to survive in the crew and ultimately rise through its ranks.
In her speech, Ulti follows certain "trends" to come across as fancy. Since her debut, she has taken to ending her sentences (sometimes incorrectly) with
arinsu
(
ありんす
?
)
—an archaic, polite copula and variant of
arimasu
that means "to be" and is associated with courtesans/
oiran
—as well as the first-person pronoun
achiki
(
あちき
?
)
, likewise associated with courtesans. According to Page One, said verbal habits (which become a generally sophisticated register in the
Viz
translation) are an attempt of Ulti's to sound like a fancy lady. When she snaps due to being annoyed, however, Ulti slips into a vulgar and bratty tone and uses the more neutral pronoun "watashi"
(
私
?
)
, showing how superficial the woman's mature manner of talking is.
Overall, Ulti has had many different ways of ending her sentences that changed over time (
see below
).
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Ulti and her brother are looked down upon as "brats" by their fellow Tobiroppo as well as the
All-Stars
, due to their young age. However, Ulti is not intimidated by her seniors and will snap back at their rude remarks.
Also, in particular, Ulti does not seem fond of the All-Star
Queen
and his performative conduct.
Page One
[
]
Ulti and Page One's sibling relationship.
Page One
is Ulti's younger brother,
two years younger than her,
and refers to her as "elder sister"
(
姉貴
,
aneki
?
, VIZ: "sis")
.
Ulti is extremely protective of Page One, whom to his annoyance she calls "Pay-tan"
(
ペーたん
,
Pē-tan
?
, VIZ: "Pay-Pay")
to be endearing, "-tan" being a more diminutive version of the name suffix "-chan" (usually used by and to address children in a "cute", affectionate manner). However, this does not fully safeguard Page One from the same hostility Ulti extends to the rest of their crew. While speaking kindly to him when unagitated, her treatment of Page One is rather volatile, ranging from supportive to demanding, to abrasive and outright violent, usually escalating the more he tries to rebuff her.
Overall, Ulti seems more overtly attached to Page One than the other way around, much to his annoyance.
She chased him during their search for
Yamato
, even latching onto and forcing him to give her a piggyback ride.
Whenever the chance arises, Ulti seeks sympathy from Page One, like when she gets hit by an attack that does not actually hurt her, though Page One tends to ignore or reject her attention-seeking. He does worry about her though, if she does sustain potentially serious harm,
and Ulti likewise gets extremely angry if someone hurts her brother.
Kaidou
[
]
After the death of their father,
Kaidou
took both Ulti and Page One (young children at the time) in under his care.
Ulti, seeming to be on good terms with the Governor-General, is affectionate yet almost brazenly casual in how she speaks to him, to Page One's dismay (though she still addresses Kaidou with the honorific "-sama"). Further, Ulti does not seem to fear Kaidou and has no qualms about insulting him, calling his apparent summoning of the Tobiroppo "dumb" for what she deemed "another family problem", even to Kaidou's own face, which Kaidou seemed unfazed by.
Yet, despite this lack of formal respect, Ulti holds Kaidou in high enough regard to believe that he will become
Pirate King
, getting offended by
Luffy
declaring that he would gain said title.
Ulti originally stole both her own and Page One's
Devil Fruits
from Kaidou to become stronger and thus survive in the crew.
Enemies
[
]
Yamato
[
]
Ulti furiously attacks Yamato.
Despite
Yamato
being Kaidou's son, Ulti does not think too highly of him, and has expressed annoyance at Kaidou's repeating "family problems" involving Yamato.
After Yamato had interrupted Ulti's battle with Luffy by knocking Ulti unconscious, the latter tried minimizing what had happened by denigrating Yamato's strength, while at the same time swearing she would avenge herself on Kaidou's child.
Upon finding Yamato on the
Live Floor
, a vexed Ulti immediately went ahead with attacking and fighting him.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Ulti first met
Monkey D. Luffy
by accident, while the latter was attempting to infiltrate
Kaidou's castle
at the beginning of the raid on
Onigashima
. Luffy's declaration that he would become Pirate King angered Ulti, as she believes no one but Kaidou is deserving of the title, which was what sparked their fight.
Ulti also humorously blamed Luffy for her own mistreatment of Page One that preceded their initial encounter,
though when her brother was attacked by the
Straw Hat captain
for real, she quickly grew outraged.
Ultimately, Ulti came to hold enough of a grudge against Luffy that she was quick to recognize him when he was gathering with his crew at Onigashima's Live Floor,
attempting a second assault on him with Page One, and later redirected said grudge toward two other Straw Hats,
Nami
and
Usopp
.
Despite Ulti's low opinion on Luffy as a candidate for Pirate King, she has acknowledged his strength and threat level, enough to bother unleashing her full
pachycephalosaurus form
against the Straw Hat, something normally considered "overkill" against most opponents, according to Ulti's subordinates.
Luffy, on the other hand, does not seem to hold equally strong feelings towards Ulti, though as with many enemies before her, he has given her a nickname: "Headbutt"
(
頭突き
,
Zutsuki
?
)
, in reference to her fighting style.
Nami
[
]
Throughout the raid on Onigashima, Ulti developed a strong hatred for Nami, initially for believing that she had assaulted her brother Page One at the Live Floor (which Usopp had tricked Ulti into believing, as he had launched the attack in question).
Afterwards, when Nami refused to comply with Ulti's demand to state that Luffy could never become Pirate King (due to the latter's prior declaration that he would) and managed to escape her clutches,
Ulti grew outright murderous towards Nami and started targeting her, swearing that she would crush the navigator's skull.
Ulti is attacked by a furious Nami.
Nami, on the other hand, initially feared Ulti due to knowing that she could not withstand her direct attacks, crying and begging for her life when Ulti threatened to kill her if she did not renounce, in Luffy's stead, his declaration of becoming Pirate King. Still, going in complete opposition to her acts of self-preservation, Nami could not bring herself to lie about her faith in Luffy, essentially telling Ulti off despite the possibility of imminent death at the Tobiroppo's hands.
Ultimately, Nami seemed to completely overcome her fears when she witnessed Ulti injuring
Tama
, an event that triggered Nami's characteristic protectiveness towards children and made the navigator retaliate against the Tobiroppo.
It was with
Zeus
' help as well as the earlier damage that Ulti had taken from Big Mom that Nami was able to bring down Ulti before she could further injure Tama.
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Because
Big Mom
violently knocked out Page One while the latter was chasing after Nami, Usopp, and Tama, Ulti was left in shock and anger despite the Emperor's status as an ally of the Beasts Pirates, swearing to avenge her brother. In spite of Big Mom's strength, Ulti does not fear her, displaying the same fierce temper toward Big Mom that she not even forgoes before Kaidou.
Big Mom, on the other hand, considers Ulti an enemy due to having witnessed the latter hurting Tama, whom Big Mom considers a friend. She was ready to punish Ulti until Nami intervened
and consequently defeated her in a single attack, as payback for laying her hand on Tama.
Though Ulti was able to recover from this attack, the internal damage she suffered from Big Mom's
Maser Ho
would help weaken her enough for Nami to finish Ulti off once and for all.
Tama
[
]
Because Ulti witnessed Big Mom knocking Page One out to avenge
Tama
and
Okobore Town
, she fully blamed the child for what had happened to her brother, thinking that the girl had somehow manipulated Big Mom into fighting against the Beasts Pirates the same way that she had
converted
the Gifters to her side.
Ulti had no qualms clawing Tama for getting in her way in their first interaction
and, after realizing the kid's role in the war, attempted to suffocate her,
leading Nami to intervene both times.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being one of the Tobiroppo, Ulti holds great authority among the Beast Pirates despite her young age, with only Kaidou and the All-Stars ranking above her.
True to her Tobiroppo status and
400,000,000
bounty
,
Ulti is a very powerful combatant, enough so to pose a threat to
Luffy
—a
Worst Generation
member with a bounty over one billion higher than hers at the time—and have him both remark on her great power and consider using
Gear 4
when Ulti held him down.
Together with Page One, Ulti was able to effortlessly defeat
Nami
and
Usopp
;
the former, in particular, Ulti has been able to get the better of and subdue in a matter of seconds.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Ulti butting heads with Luffy in her human form.
Despite her small frame, Ulti's physical strength is immense, even when she is not transformed into her dinosaur form. This is chiefly seen from the extreme offensive power of her headbutts, her signature style of attack. She can thrust her head forward with incredible force and unleash blows so powerful, they have been compared to the blast of a cannon. Even when only in her human form, Ulti was able to overpower Luffy, who has tremendous strength of his own, in a headbutting clash, creating a violent shockwave and sending Luffy flying back, though the latter emerged with little to no injury.
It has been stated by Ulti herself and others that her headbutts can split or completely crush an enemy's skull.
Against physically weaker foes like Nami and Usopp, Ulti's headbutts have indeed proven able to cause disabling injury and (in Usopp's case) crack a skull.
Ulti even managed to physically contend with
Yamato
, Kaidou's child who boasts immense brawn himself, for some time, although Ulti was ultimately overpowered.
Even in human form, Ulti has immense durability, noted by
Zeus
to be extremely tough on the outside.
She is able to bash her bare head against targets with extreme force, in succession and remain unfazed (though her use of Armament may aid her in this).
It ultimately took a multitude of powerful lightning bolts piercing through and dealing internal damage to Ulti (including a super-concentrated
fire-and-lightning beam
created by
Big Mom
, on top of lightning guided by Zeus to engulf Ulti's entire body) to knock her out.
Attacks
[
]
Ul-Zugan
(
ウル
頭銃
,
Uru Zugan
?
, Literally meaning "Ul Head Gun")
: Ulti jumps into the air and rears her head back before covering her forehead in
Armament Haki
and slamming it forward into her target's head. The force of this attack is so extreme that some of Ulti's crewmates were heard comparing it to a cannon shot, likely to pulverize the target's skull.
The attack was first seen in use against Luffy, while Ulti was in her human form, and although it physically overpowered Luffy it did not cause him any notable injury.
In the
Viz
translation and
Funimation
subtitles, the attack is called
Ulti-Mortar
.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Pachycephalosaurus
Ulti in her pachycephalosaurus hybrid form (with size compared to
Nami
, an average human).
Ulti ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Pachycephalosaurus, an
Ancient Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to become a full
pachycephalosaurus
and a human-pachycephalosaurus hybrid at will. Ulti's crewmates consider her full Beast Form excessive force against most enemies, likely to wreak great collateral damage, and she only uses it against opponents she takes seriously.
When transformed, Ulti's already immense physical power increases; in her full Beast Form, she could immobilize Luffy by grabbing hold of the pirate's shoulders, despite his own incredible strength. Furthermore, as a dinosaur, Ulti is much tougher than regular Zoan users, swiftly recovering from
Yamato
's
Raimei Hakke
, which only briefly rendered her unconscious after a direct hit,
and remaining conscious after a
powerful bolt of lightning
piercing her abdomen.
Ulti's mobility, too, is enhanced, allowing her to disappear from sight and dart around extremely swiftly.
As the most notable aspect of her power, both in her Human-Beast form and Full Beast form (most so the latter), Ulti gains an extremely durable, super-thick skull plate that perfectly complements her signature headbutting attacks.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Armament Haki
[
]
Ulti is very skilled in using
Armament Haki
, being able to harden her forehead, which allows her to strengthen the force of her headbutts. She was capable of clashing against and overpowered Luffy, a powerful Armament Haki user himself, in their initial encounter, despite Luffy's own use of Hardening.
Observation Haki
[
]
Ulti can use
Observation Haki
, having shown usage of it to sense Luffy's Haki and realize he was still alive after she had attacked him. Though Ulti was also able to sense Yamato coming toward her at one point, she could not avoid his surprise attack in time.
Weapons
[
]
Ulti's morning star.
Ulti wields a sharp-spiked, yellow,
morning star
-like club, which she used to clash with the
kanabo
-wielding Yamato.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Ulti was born on the
Grand Line
22 years ago.
She and her brother
Page One
(two years after her) were born to an unknown male pirate who eventually died.
Kaidou
, who had been acquainted with their father, took the siblings in. Ulti eventually stole two Devil Fruits (Ryu Ryu no Mi, Models:
Pachycephalosaurus
and
Spinosaurus
) from Kaidou for herself and Page One to partake of, to make themselves into formidable fighting forces for Kaidou and thereby persevere in the
Beasts Pirates
, a crew in which only the strong survive. Eventually, the siblings both became
Tobiroppo
.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
The Tobiroppo gathered together on Onigashima.
Ulti and the other Tobiroppo arrived at
Onigashima
during the latest
Fire Festival
, with (seemingly) Kaidou having them brought to
his castle
.
As they waited to meet with him,
Queen
tried to get them involved in the festivities, to Ulti's derision. Ulti questioned why Kaidou wanted to meet with them and asked if he was "dumb", making the other Tobiroppo react with sharp disapproval.
When Kaidou then greeted the six in his castle, he gave them the mission of finding his son
Yamato
(much to Ulti's annoyance), saying he would let them battle one of the All-Stars for their post if they succeeded.
Ulti and Page One come across Luffy.
While searching for Yamato in the castle, Ulti tagged along with Page One, whom she forced to carry her when she grew tired of running. After causing him to tumble down some stairs, the pair encountered
Monkey D. Luffy
.
When Luffy, in introducing himself, declared he was going to be Pirate King, Ulti angrily responded that Kaidou was the one to take that title, subsequently butting heads with the enemy. This brief clash saw Ulti sending her foe crashing into the floor, but she sensed how he was unharmed and so entered
her Human-Beast Form
. Luffy emerged from his crater, rushed toward the siblings, and before they could react Ulti grabbed by the horns to slam her down, before seemingly defeating Page One with an
Elephant Gun
. Ulti then grabbed Luffy's arms and prepared to headbutt him yet again in her full Beast Form, as Luffy prepared to activate
Gear 4
, but Yamato appeared suddenly and, before Ulti could properly react, struck her with his kanabo, knocking Ulti out.
In the time that Yamato ran away with Luffy, Page One tried to shake Ulti awake, and when she did wake up swiftly, she rudely told the surrounding doctors to lay off before hugging Page One and demanding affection. She then grew angry when Page One ran off to chase after Yamato and Luffy.
After hearing that Luffy and Yamato went to the Performance Stage in front of the castle, Ulti headed there, intent on making Yamato pay for attacking her.
Upon finding Yamato, she immediately went on the offensive using her morning star, which was blocked by Yamato's kanabo. Ulti expressed confused anger once Yamato declared the intention to become "
Kouzuki Oden
",
and they proceeded to further clash
until Yamato got away.
As the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
was waging war on Onigashima, Ulti and Page One received a call from
King
informing the Tobiroppo that the challenge for an opportunity to fight the All-Stars was cancelled, and that they were to stop the enemy alliance from getting to the roof of the dome, where Kaidou was fighting the
Nine Red Scabbards
.
Ulti and Page One thereafter attacked some samurai who attempted to stop the two from reaching Luffy. After
Usopp
, while hiding behind
Nami
, launched an attack on Page One, the two Tobiroppo chased after the two Straw Hats.
Later, Ulti received another call from King, who ordered the Tobiroppo to go after Oden's son,
Momonosuke
, and kill him in order to break the enemy samurais' will to fight.
Ulti cracks Usopp's skull with a headbutt in her hybrid form.
While fighting Nami and Usopp in her hybrid form, Ulti severely injured Usopp and Nami using headbutts, all the while the siblings easily dealt with Usopp's
Pop Green
attacks. After knocking Usopp out of commission with her
Ul-Zugan
, Ulti grabbed Nami and prepared to finish her off. Nami promised to leave Onigashima if Ulti spared her, and Ulti ordered her to say out loud that Luffy would never become Pirate King. However, Nami responded that Luffy would, and as Ulti prepared to kill her for it, Ulti was suddenly bitten by
Komachiyo
, a komainu ridden by
Tama
.
Thereafter, Tama managed to escape with Nami and Usopp on the komainu while her accompanying baboon
Hihimaru
started engaging Ulti and Page One to keep them busy.
Soon after, the siblings had defeated the baboon and broke through a castle wall to the outside, both as fully transformed dinosaurs, proceeding to search for the escaped Straw Hats.
Ulti and Page One soon found Nami and Usopp again. In resuming the chase, they reached the Right-Brain Tower where
Sasaki
was fighting
Franky
. Ulti, in her hybrid form, quickly jumped over to Nami and Usopp, who were still riding the komainu, and prepared to attack with a headbutt. Instead, Nami attacked Ulti with a surprise
Thunder Lance Tempo
, piercing Ulti from behind and causing her to fall to the ground. Burned but still conscious, Ulti angrily swore to get back at Nami.
Ulti gets blasted down by Big Mom's Maser Cannon.
Later, Ulti arrived just in time on the second floor of Kaidou's castle to witness the
Emperor
Big Mom
knock out Page One with a punch, infuriating Ulti and shocking her subordinates.
Ulti started dashing toward Big Mom angrily, with Nami unsuccessfully trying to spur Ulti and Big Mom on to fight. Ulti, in Human-Beast Form, sprang toward Komachiyo on which Nami and Usopp were riding, telling them not to get away. She used her
Ul-Zugan
to violently headbutt into the komainu, seriously injuring and putting him out of commission. When Tama cried for Ulti to stop hurting her animal friend, Ulti slapped the girl, enraging both Big Mom and consequently Nami, who hit her with a strong lightning bolt that launched Ulti back.
Ulti, mentioning how Nami was finally committed to fighting, then dodged a follow-up
Tornado Tempo
before grabbing onto Nami's arms, eager to finally crush the woman's skull. Before she could do so, Big Mom used her special Homies—
Napoleon
,
Prometheus
, and
Hera
—to launch a powerful,
concentrated beam of fire and lightning
that struck Ulti, causing her to fall over unconscious.
Ulti is finished off by Zeus, under Nami's command.
Soon following this, Ulti once again regained consciousness, caught up to Usopp and Nami, and knocked the former down with a surprise headbutt. She then held up Tama by the neck, noting how it was the girl who was behind the
Gifters
betraying the Beasts Pirates, as well as Big Mom taking out Page One. Nami hit her using her
"living"
Clima-Tact morphed into a spiked club, which failed to even move Ulti. Usopp then briefly prevented the Tobiroppo from moving using his
Midori Boshi: Sargasso
, giving Nami the time to launch lightning at her. Though Ulti dodged it, the lightning bolt was actually animated by Zeus, homing in on and hitting the woman straight on regardless, once again knocking Ulti out as a result of the internal damage she suffered. Her defeat and Page One's were then, accidentally, announced in a
voice broadcast
by
Bao Huang
.
