Water 7
.

History

Past
[

Corgi repeatedly approached
Iceburg
with various offers to convince him to hand over the blueprints for
Pluton
. However, Iceburg feigned ignorance and rejected him each time.
Water 7 Saga
[

Water 7 Arc
[
]
Corgi arrived at the
Galley-La Company
with yet another offer and demanded a private meeting with Iceburg.
However, he was denied once again and left in a huff.
Corgi is defeated by Sogeking.
Corgi later received
Robin
at the Blue Station and led her aboard the
Puffing Tom
. He then greeted the
CP9
upon their arrival and accompanied them on the sea train.
Aboard the train, he kept CP9 informed of the situation and directed the forces according to
Lucci
's orders when an
intruder
was detected.
He later confronted Robin in her passenger car, forcing
Sogeking
to hide under her cloak.
He was knocked out by Sogeking after seeing through the trick.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, Corgi is defeated off-screen. The anime extends the sequence of Corgi in Robin's passenger car, showing him about to leave before becoming suspicious again and eventually noticing Usopp's legs. He is then defeated by Usopp firing an explosive pellet at him as he tries to escape.
