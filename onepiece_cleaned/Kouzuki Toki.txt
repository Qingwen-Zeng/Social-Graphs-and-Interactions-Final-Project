Kouzuki Toki
,
born
Amatsuki
, was the wife of the daimyo of
Kuri
,
Kouzuki Oden
and the mother of
Kouzuki Momonosuke
and
Kouzuki Hiyori
.
She was born around 830 years before the present day. By the time she was 26 years old, she jumped forward in time with her
Devil Fruit
ability
and arrived 30 years before the present when she met Oden
and stayed with him for 10 years until he was executed, and she was killed during the destruction of
Oden Castle
.
Appearance
[
]
At age 26, Toki was a tall woman with long dark (light-green in the anime) hair that was kept back with the exception of two strands in front resembling of her daughter,
Kouzuki Hiyori
. She wore a flower ornament with a chain of pearls on the right side of her hair. She also wore a short pink kimono with crescent moons resembling the
Kouzuki Family
's symbol on the bottom. She held a strong resemblance to her daughter.
A few years later, she received a scar on her left thigh from an arrow shot defending her children.
Personality
[
]
Toki was a friendly and caring woman as she took care of
Kouzuki Oden
when he washed ashore on the island she was on to repay him for scaring away human traffickers. Her friendliness could make her somewhat naive as she went with some human traffickers under the impression that they would take her to
Wano
, although she did manage to quickly expose their ruse. When she came to 30 years before the present, she showed an excited attitude at going to Wano.
After she married Oden, his retainers came to possess tremendous respect for her.
She was also humble as she worked with the citizens of
Kuri
and never boasted about being the wife of a daimyo.

Whitebeard Pirates
. Despite being from the past, she married Oden and finally settled down with him in
Wano Country
. When she had fallen ill, she encouraged Oden to continue his journey without her. When Oden returned to Wano after completing his journey, Toki was overjoyed to see him again. Once he learned that Toki got injured protecting
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, Oden was furious and went after
Kurozumi Oroch
, ignoring Toki's pleas. After Oden was executed, Toki used her
Devil Fruit
powers to send Momonosuke and four of the
Nine Red Scabbards
to the future for a chance to fulfill Oden's dream of opening the borders of Wano Country while she remained behind to meet her end, choosing to join her husband in the afterlife.

while Hiyori was so traumatized that she did not speak for a long time.
Whitebeard Pirates
[
]
Toki met
Whitebeard
the day after she met
Kouzuki Oden
. Soon, she asked his permission to stay on his ship, which Whitebeard allowed. However, it is unknown if she was ever engaged in piracy while she traveled with the crew. Some time later, she revealed her age and origin from the past only to be laughed at by the crew.
Nine Red Scabbards

Toki is deeply respected by the
Nine Red Scabbards
.
After
Kouzuki Oden
's death,
Kin'emon
,
Kurozumi Kanjuro
,
Raizo
,
Kikunojo
and
Kawamatsu
braved through the burning Kuri Castle to rescue her and her children. When Kin'emon declared their resolve to realize Oden's will by overthrowing both
Kaidou
and
Kurozumi Orochi
as well as opening Wano Country's borders to the world, Toki smiled in silent gratitude and as a final sign of trust, she entrusted Momonosuke to Kin'emon and
Kouzuki Hiyori
to Kawamatsu.
Wano Country Citizens
[
]
Toki is also well respected by the
Wano Country
citizens as well as
Kouzuki Family
retainers. Many samurai such as
Jibuemon
wholeheartedly trust her prophecy about nine samurais overthrowing

and
Kurozumi Orochi
in twenty years.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being the
wife
of
Kouzuki Oden
, the daimyo of
Kuri
, Toki possessed a considerable amount of status in Wano Country until Oden was executed.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Toki Toki no Mi
Toki prepares to go to the future.
Toki ate the Toki Toki no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allowed her to send herself and others forward in time.
She could send herself or others years and even decades into the future. However, the ability is strictly one-way; it was impossible for Toki to send herself and others backward in time.
Her consumption of the Fruit and gaining its power allowed Toki to escape from dangerous situations by going forward to a point when the danger is long past. Because of this, she ended up traveling a grand total of 800 years into the future, ending up in Wano three decades before the present day. The last time she used the Fruit's power was before her death, sending her son
Kouzuki Momonosuke
and some of the
Nine Red Scabbards
ahead two decades into the future to save them from the
Beasts Pirates
.
Weapons
[
]
Toki carried a katana and pulled it out when confronting
Karma
and his gang, but seemed to have no intention of using it against them as she had planned to escape by traveling into the future; thus, it is unclear if she had any swordsmanship skill.

Birth and Time-Travel
[
]
Toki was born around 830 years ago before the present time, which was during the
Void Century
. Despite being part of the Amatsuki daimyo family, she did not know about her homeland. After consuming the
Toki Toki no Mi
, she traveled forward in time multiple times whenever she was in danger.
Journey with Pirates
[
]
Toki came to the time 30 years before the present day and met a
pirate crew
led by
Karma
, who said they would help her get to
Wano Country
. However, she quickly realized that they were actually human traffickers and confronted them as she prepared to escape through time again. However, Karma's gang ran away after seeing
Kouzuki Oden
(with a massively swollen body), whom they mistook for a sea demon, walk ashore. Toki treated Oden's wounds and the next day, they were confronted by Karma. However, Karma was then defeated by
Whitebeard
, who took Toki and Oden aboard his ship, where they sailed the
New World
with the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
During the voyage, Toki married Oden and on their second year on the
Moby Dick
, Toki gave birth to a son,
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, followed by a daughter,
Kouzuki Hiyori
, two years later.
After Oden encountered
Gol D. Roger
and decided to assist him with his final journey, Toki then boarded the
Oro Jackson
with her husband and children.
Sometime after the
Roger Pirates
' visit to
Fish-Man Island
, Toki became ill because of stress accumulated throughout her journey. When the crew reached Wano Country, Toki forced Oden to continue with his adventures until the end or else she would divorce him. Toki then stayed at Wano with her children.
Life in Wano
[
]
After she recovered from her illness, Toki worked with the citizens of
Kuri
where she and her children became beloved figures of the Kuri region. Around half a year before
Kouzuki Oden
finished with his voyage, a group of
Beasts Pirates
attacked
Kuri Castle
while
Kin'emon
and some of his fellow retainers went to the
Flower Capital
to confront
Kurozumi Orochi
. The Beasts Pirates were driven away by
Kawamatsu
and
Inuarashi
, but Toki was injured while she was protecting Momonosuke. After Oden returned to Wano, Toki and her children welcomed him back. However, once Oden heard about what happened to Toki, she tried to calm him, but could not stop him as he charged towards the Flower Capital.
After Oden failed to kill Orochi, Oden's family still loved him despite him acting like a fool and losing the respect of most of Wano's people for the next five years.
Before Oden left Kuri to fight
Kaidou
, he gave Toki a letter.
While Oden and the
Scabbards
fought the Beasts Pirates in the
Udon
region, Toki and her children stayed in Oden Castle while they were guarded by
Shimotsuki Yasuie
and his men.
After Oden was defeated and captured, Toki visited him while he was imprisoned in the Flower Capital. Oden handed his swords to Toki and asked her to pass them on to their children.
On the day of Oden's execution, Momonosuke asked his mother why his life was in danger. Toki explained that it was because he would one day lead Wano.
Toki prepares to send her retainers and Momonosuke to the future.
After Toki received the news of
Oden's death
, she read the letter that Oden gave to her before tearing it apart.
Toki was in Kuri Castle with Momonosuke and Hiyori when Kaidou, who was working with Orochi, set it ablaze. When the retainers returned to the castle, they begged her to join them in retreating to Zou. Instead, however, she chooses to send Momonosuke, along with Kin'emon,
Kurozumi Kanjuro
,
Raizo
and
Kikunojo
20 years forward in time while entrusting Hiyori in Kawamatsu's care.
Though reluctant, the scabbards obeyed this request from her.
After her retainers have all fled with her children, Toki herself fled the castle on a horseback and headed to Bakura Town as members of the
Beasts Pirates
shot at her with arrows and guns. When she arrived at the giant torii gate, she spoke a prophecy with the burning castle behind her.
Toki speaks her final words.
Her final moments were witnessed by the citizens of Bakura Town, but just as she finished her speech, she was shot by her pursuers; Toki then collapsed to the ground and died.
Legacy
[
]
Toki's prophecy to
Wano Country
inspired strong hope in the followers and retainers of the
Kouzuki Family
and an intense fear in
Kurozumi Orochi
, which they interpreted that in twenty years,
nine samurai
would exact vengeance on Orochi in
Kouzuki Oden
's name and open the borders of Wano Country.
The Red Scabbards cut down Orochi.
Ironically, Orochi would be the only one to take Toki's prophecy seriously, fearing the day when the followers of the Kouzuki Family will rise up to take his life. He would spend the next twenty years doing everything in his power to prevent any chance of this happening. Toki's prophecy would be fulfilled when six of the
Nine Red Scabbards
beheaded Orochi after the latter lost
Kaidou
's protection and support with
Denjiro
beheading Orochi for the last time, ending the life of the tyrannical shogun.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, Toki is shown drawing a sword in an attempt to protect
Kouzuki Momonosuke
and
Kouzuki Hiyori
from
Kaidou
at
Kuri
Castle, before the latter swiftly slams her out of his way. She is also shot with an arrow in the middle of her final speech, but manages to finish it before being shot to death.
In the manga, Toki explains to
Kouzuki Oden
why his
vassals
do not want to learn his
sword style
.
In the anime, this scene was omitted, and instead, the explanation is given by
Kin'emon
.
