"Overflowing" Sasaki
is a
bluespine unicornfish
fish-man
and
one
of the
Tobiroppo
, the strongest six Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates.
He also leads the crew's Armored Division.
Before joining the Beasts Pirates, he
captained
his own crew
called the
Sasaki Pirates
.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist in the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Sasaki is a bluespine unicornfish fish-man who stands at just shy of 3.2 meters,
with a portly build and light skin. He possesses sharp and slanted, blue eyes underlined by notable creases, a mildly hooked nose and a set of sharp, fanged teeth with two long bottom canines (jutting out even with his mouth closed), as well as a flat chin. His shaggy hair is colored yellowish-green and reaches down to his middle back, with a golden hoop earring visible on both his ears. A black (more grayish in the anime) tattoo is located around his shoulder areas, including the upper arms, chest, and back, with many curved, vane-like shapes bringing on a resemblance to wings.
Sasaki's clothes seem a distinct blend of traditional Japanese and a military/dictator's style of attire. On his head is a military cap with a black, low-set visor and a white crown that is extra-wide, puffy, dented breadthwise with the front raised, and split by a lengthwise seam. Above the black bottom edge (spaced from it) runs a black band lined with a row of gold studs, holding in the front a golden badge depicting a double-cross shape (eight-armed, the diagonals less prominent, with a small middle stud). Set below, front and center, is a pair of slender, golden horns that curve upward, lending Sasaki (together with his fangs) a rather demonic look. Otherwise, the man wears a cloak akin to a seaman's, slung on his shoulders with the sleeves hanging back, that has a folded standup collar bearing on each side a simpler version of the hat's badge. The coat has a solid-white coloration over its upper half, which ends around waist level with a downward-facing flame motif, contrasting against the orange-colored rest of the coat. Below, Sasaki's torso is bare, partly showing off the aforesaid tattoo. For lower wear, Sasaki dons a hakama-like article resembling the bottom half of a double-breasted trench coat, which is flame-patterned the same as the cloak (but with the upper half beige-colored instead of white), closed by eight gray buttons, and held up by a golden, buckled belt. Finally, Sasaki sports a pair of brown gloves and grayish-brown, double-toothed geta sandals.
Personality
[
]
Outside of battle, Sasaki is shown to be a rather calm and easygoing man, albeit not above derision and prone to scoff at his equal-ranking peers.
Still, he acts cordial toward those he considers friends, like formerly
"Kyoshiro"
, but will not tolerate any breach of fidelity; if betrayed, he will aim to ensure the traitor pays a steep price.
Even when he knew that his own subordinates had been turned against him against their will due to a
Devil Fruit power
, Sasaki still proclaimed them as traitors and was willing to personally take them out.
An ambitious man, Sasaki seeks to become one of the
Beasts Pirates
' All-Stars by claiming a spot from the current ones, causing him to disregard their senior authority. This resolve, according to
King
, arises from Sasaki's past as captain of his own crew, bearing out on his part a high degree of confidence in his strength, enough for him to look forward to a chance to directly challenge an All-Star.
Yet, Sasaki is also prideful in his Tobiroppo status, claiming that his current group is why the Beasts Pirates are as feared as they are.
As far as combat is concerned, Sasaki is proud of his ability to
become a dinosaur
, believing dinosaurs to be the strongest animals that ever existed,
though is also not above exploiting an advantage of numbers afforded by own crew should his personal enemy prove tough, having his subordinates aid him in a fight.
Additionally, when he makes mistakes in battle, Sasaki is too proud to admit as much and will justify his blunders as intentional decisions on his part.
This prideful attitude also extends to his enemies, as he became infuriated when
Franky
ran from him during their fight, calling him shameless.
It is implied by Kyoshiro that Sasaki is fond of partying, since the former thought that Sasaki's presence outside the
Golden Kagura
was uncharacteristic of him;
having a fondness for drinking as indicated by his epithet,
Sasaki conducted his search for
Yamato
with a sake bottle in hand.
However, the Tobiroppo member sees himself as above drinking with rank and file, expressing his wish to drink with none other than
Kaidou
.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Among the
Tobiroppo
, Sasaki and
Who's-Who
are considered dangerous troublemakers.
Nontheless, Sasaki heavily respects Kaidou like his peers, and when
Ulti
insulted their boss in his absence, Sasaki grew shocked.
He also seems to be on casual enough terms with Kaidou to express his wish to drink with him during the Golden Kagura, stating to have no interest in fraternizing with mere underlings.
Like Who's-Who, Sasaki looks at the current
All-Stars
as obstacles in his pursuit to take one of their spots, thus acting insubordinate toward them and ignoring any summons order without Kaidou's name attached to it; when Kaidou offered to allow any Tobiroppo member to challenge an All-Star should they succeed in retrieving Yamato, Sasaki gleefully accepted the challenge.
Further, while friendly enough with his fellow Tobiroppo to sit and banter with them, Sasaki views them as competition, given that some of them too aspire to climb up a rank. He mockingly discouraged
X Drake
and
Page One
from pursuing such advancement, effectively calling the latter dead weight.
Initially, Sasaki held his
Armored Division
in high regard, noting how he could not afford to lose them.
When going out to battle with his men, he had a large rhinoceros
SMILE
user carry him on a high-backed throne labeled with his name,
wherein he lounged until his own involvement was required. Ultimately, Sasaki came to declare his vaunted division as traitors whom he was willing to personally dispose of, disregarding the fact that his men had essentially been
brainwashed
into betrayal.
Enemies
[
]
Denjiro
[
]
Sasaki saw a friend in
Denjiro
during the latter's time posing as Kyoshiro, though with Denjiro's backstabbing him during the latest Fire Festival, Sasaki swore he would avenge himself on the samurai.
Yamato
[
]
Sasaki does not seem to think too highly of
Yamato
despite him being Kaidou's son, calling Yamato a brat behind his back.
However, he still addresses Yamato as "Young Master"
(
ぼっちゃん
,
Botchan
?
)
, though he seemed not too upset by Yamato's apparent betrayal of the Beasts Pirates and had no qualms about personally fighting Yamato, even deeming his suggestion that he could take him on while simultaneously protecting
Shinobu
and
Momonosuke
as an insult.
Franky
[
]
During the
Raid on Onigashima
, Sasaki became enemies with
Franky
of the
Straw Hat Pirates
, and the two engaged in a fierce battle. Sasaki became annoyed at Franky dealing with his subordinates easily and boasted that, as a dinosaur, Franky stood no chance against him.
Despite his gloating, Sasaki showed that he was not above exploiting his numbers advantage by having his men continue to aid him in the fight, such as by restraining Franky.
As the battle went on, both combatants grew irritated at each other's toughness, and after activating his spinning drill-sword and triceratops frill, Sasaki began having Franky on the ropes, calling him shameful for making a tactical retreat while chasing him. After several attempts, Sasaki succeeded in damaging his foe's
high-powered robot exoskeleton
, enough to force the Straw Hat to eject, but Sasaki still ended up losing his fight due to the enemy
cyborg
shooting a laser beam at Sasaki's main weak spot, his large triceratops belly.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of the Tobiroppo, Sasaki holds great authority in the Beasts Pirates, only Kaidou himself and the All-Stars ranking above him;
in particular, Sasaki leads the crew's Armored Division.
Further, as an ex-
pirate captain
, Sasaki used to have full command over his own crew at some point.
Like the other Tobiroppo, Sasaki is a powerful combatant whose strength makes him potentially worth challenging the All-Stars for their post, something Sasaki seemed confident in his ability to do.
He possesses tremendous strength and stamina, partly a result of his fish-man heritage.
Among the Tobiroppo, he has the third highest
bounty
at
472,000,000,
indicating his threat level.
Sasaki damaging the General Franky.
Against
Franky
, Sasaki was able to hold his own for an extended period of time while his foe piloted his
General Franky
throughout the fight's duration, keeping his real body secure inside the robot. Though Sasaki was ultimately taken out by two of Franky's strongest attacks back to back, one of which exploited his weak spot as a triceratops, Sasaki was able to force Franky out of the robot with his own final attack, even destroying part of it, despite the mech being tough enough to withstand a point-blank missile explosion with no damage.
Sasaki's resilience was commended by Franky, who claimed that Sasaki had survived several finishing moves all throughout their fight.
Devil Fruit
[

Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Triceratops
Sasaki transformed into a triceratops.
Sasaki ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Triceratops, an
Ancient Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a triceratops, and hybrid form, at will.
Though having lost his ability to swim and thus his physiological advantages in water, as a fish-man, Sasaki retains his ability to breathe underwater, though full submergence would still render him immobile.
As an Ancient Zoan, his transformation grants Sasaki an immense increase in physical strength, allowing him to charge into opponents with great force, enough to knock back a
powerful, 13m-tall robot
. Furthermore, with his hardy triceratops skin, Sasaki enjoys an increase in durability, enough to be unfazed by heavy, explosive artillery fire,
though his less-protected belly remains as a weak spot.
As a triceratops, Sasaki bears three long, pointy horns on his head. His primary method of combat is to charge at his opponents headfirst and pierce them with his horns.
In his hybrid form, he also possesses the abnormal ability to make his neck frill rotate around like a propeller, greatly increasing the speed of his charges and allowing him to simulate flight.
Haki

Sasaki possesses the ability to use
Armament
and

Despite this, he has never been seen using either in combat, being more reliant on his Devil Fruit.
Weapons

Further information:
Karakuri Rasento
Sasaki's mechanized sword, the Karakuri Rasento.
For combat, Sasaki
wields
a special sword that he dubs as Karakuri Rasento. It is equipped with a rotational mechanism that allows the blade to spin at high speeds whenever Sasaki activates it, with a series of small blade flaps, perpendicularly set to the main blade, making it like a portable drill. With the Rasento, Sasaki can easily shred opponents or their weapons alike, including other swords By using it in tandem with his Zoan transformation (particularly his rotating neck frill), Sasaki can perform a powerful, aerial style of swordplay that can easily overwhelm
unseasoned
enemy swordsmen.
History

Past
[

Sasaki was born 34 years ago on the
Grand Line
. He captained his own pirate crew, the
Sasaki Pirates
,
before he joined the
Beasts Pirates
. After joining them, he developed the goal of becoming one of the All-Stars by replacing a current one.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
The Tobiroppo gathered together on Onigashima.
The Tobiroppo, including Sasaki, arrived on
Onigashima
following the beginning of the latest
Fire Festival
.
Kaidou
had supposedly summoned them to his castle, and while waiting they started chatting about who of them would become the next All-Star if
Queen
died. As
X Drake
denied any interest in promotion, Sasaki welcomed his noncompetitive attitude, drawing
Ulti
's ire by suggesting
Page One
do the same. Sasaki then intimated what he thought Kaidou's reason was for calling them, and consequently grew shocked with the other four when Ulti insulted their Governor-General.
Kaidou thereafter greeted the six in his castle, and they learned how
King
was the one who had summoned them, the latter mentioning to Sasaki and
Who's-Who
their goal of becoming All-Stars and telling them to know their place. Kaidou then gave the Tobiroppo the mission of finding his son
Yamato
, stating he would let them battle one of the All-Stars for their post if they succeeded.
Sasaki chained up by Denjiro.
Later on, letting his men search for Yamato near the gate located on the southwest of the island, Sasaki ran into
Denjiro
, whom he still thought to be his ally "Kyoshiro". Thus, with Sasaki's guard down, Denjiro managed to have him chained up, with Sasaki bewildered at the apparent betrayal.
Once the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's raid on Onigashima was fully raging, a massive attack from
Big Mom
reached Sasaki all the way from the Skull Dome and destroyed the sacred tree he was tied to,
freeing him from his chains. Afterwards, Sasaki was found by his lackeys and, while being informed of the situation, swore revenge on Denjiro, whom he had considered his friend. He later received a call from King informing the Tobiroppo that the challenge for the right to fight an All-Star was cancelled, and that they were to stop the enemy alliance from getting to the Skull Dome's roof where Kaidou was fighting the
Nine Red Scabbards
.
Sasaki and his subordinates confront Yamato.
Thereafter, King ordered the Tobiroppo to bring him the head of
Kouzuki Oden
's son,
Momonosuke
, in order to break the enemy samurais' will to fight. Sasaki encountered the boy and
Shinobu
while they were fleeing the castle, in the
Right-Brain Tower
. He had his accompanying men, the
Armored Division
, fire bazooka and arrow shots at them, telling the kunoichi not to interfere. Just as Shinobu was about to be finished off by a
Gifter
, Yamato came in to block the attack, prompting Sasaki to question Yamato's motives.
Reiterating how killing Momonosuke would see their mission completed, Sasaki looked on in surprise and consequent annoyance as Yamato used his body to shield Momonosuke and Shinobu from more explosive rounds, and then knocked out another Gifter with his weapon.
As Yamato continued engaging his division, Sasaki commented on Yamato's declaration that he would not leave Shinobu behind, taking it as insult given the implication that Yamato could defeat him while protecting dead weight. As Sasaki began drawing his sword,
Franky
within the
General Franky
appeared being chased by the
Number
Hatcha
, with the giant then blowing a hole into the floor trying to hit said robot. When Yamato took the chance to escape with Shinobu and Momonosuke through the hole into the lower floor (but not before knocking out Hatcha as they did so), Sasaki irately commanded his men to follow them.
When Franky then overwhelmed his men with his
General Launcher
from inside his robot, Sasaki told them to move aside before activating his
triceratops transformation
and charging into the robot, knocking him back a fair distance.
Sasaki pierced by Franky's Franken sword.
Soon after, Sasaki and Franky were locked in fierce combat.
As Franky shot at Sasaki with his
General Left
, the latter (still in his full Beast Form) remained unfazed as he again charged into the General Franky. Franky managed to stop the charge by having his robot grab hold of Sasaki's nasal horn, and then shoulder-threw the dinosaur into the wall behind them, though Sasaki quickly regained his balance. As he prepared yet another charge at Franky, Sasaki had his Armored Division restrain the General Franky. However, as Sasaki began rushing toward them, he was surprised by the suddenly-appearing
Nami
and
Usopp
, who had managed to brainwash numerous Gifters into becoming their allies thanks to
Tama
's
dangos
. Said Gifters helped Franky narrowly avoid Sasaki's charge, with the also-arriving Ulti and Page One clarifying the Gifters' betrayal. Usopp then fed dangos to Sasaki's subordinates, making them betray Sasaki. While the latter was distracted, Franky took the chance to surprise-attack him with his "Franken" sword, slashing Sasaki in his belly using
Shori no V-Flash
.
As Sasaki continued clashing with Franky, the two combatants heard
Sanji
's cry for help
broadcasted
throughout Onigashima, with Sasaki laughing at Sanji's predicament.
The Tobiroppo member had later temporarily changed back into normal form and reacted with surprise upon learning of Ulti's and Page One's defeats through another voice broadcast.
As Sasaki and Franky's duel continued, the latter started being overwhelmed by interfering Gifters.
Soon, however, all remaining Gifters had defected to the rebellion's side, on Tama's last order. Angered, Sasaki stated that controlled or not, the Armored Division were traitors. Sasaki then entered his hybrid form, noting his intent to go to the Live Floor after taking out Franky. He activated the blade rotation of his
mechanized sword
and then lifted himself into the air using his spinning neck frill. With his
Heliceratops
attack, Sasaki proceeded to mow down numerous Gifters from midair using his sword and frill, before crossing blades with the General Franky and having his sword barely deflected aside. Sasaki then tried charging forward to set upon Franky once more but accidentally spun his frill the wrong way round, pushing himself backward. Brushing this off as him going for run-up distance, Sasaki propelled himself at Franky headfirst using his
Tamaceratops
attack, his horn piercing into the General Franky's left shoulder and making its rocket launcher misfire, which Franky countered by consequently suplexing Sasaki. Sasaki swiftly rose up and began overwhelming Franky with his sword, breaking Franky's Franken and causing him to fall back in the Live Floor's direction.
Sasaki is defeated by Franky.
To catch up to his running foe, Sasaki once gain initiated his
Tamaceratops
technique to launch himself forward, with Franky taking the chance to instantly turn around and shoot his
General Cannon
at Sasaki, who was blown up high into the air by the blast. Still conscious and unwilling to give up, Sasaki declared his intent to take Franky down with him, flying back down at tremendous speed using his
Magnumceratops
move, hitting the General Franky straight-on with his horn, pushing it down, and destroying part of it. However, Franky had ejected himself from his robot in time, now lying next to it and promptly launching his
Franky Radical Beam
to pierce right into Sasaki's triceratops belly—his prior-noted weak spot—to successfully defeat the Tobiroppo member.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime amid
Kawamatsu
's flashback showing his past with
Onimaru
(well before the Tobiroppo's introduction on Onigashima), Sasaki is seen in a brief shot alongside Kaidou, the All-Stars, and Who's-Who, in Kawamatsu's imagination; despite this taking place 13 years before the present day, Sasaki (like the others) is depicted looking the same as his present-day self.
