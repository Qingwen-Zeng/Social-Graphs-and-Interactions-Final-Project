,
commonly known as
Professor Clover
(
クローバー博士
,
Kurōbā-hakase
?
)
, was the director of the
Ohara
Library, and a leading authority on archaeology. He was a professor and
archaeologist
who studied
Poneglyphs
with his fellow colleagues in the
Tree of Knowledge
.
During his younger years, he was also an infamous
explorer
known for getting repeatedly caught by the
Marines
.
Clover and his fellow archaeologists died 22 years ago for conducting forbidden research on the
Void Century
, which led the
World Government
to
decimate
the island of Ohara through a
Buster Call
.
Appearance
[
]
Clover was an elderly man with a shaved top, with his green hair adjusted jutting on the sides and the back top, combined with a large beard, all in the shape of leaves. This overall was a reminiscence of an upside down three-leaf clover. He wore a red-and-white striped shirt with a large belt at his waist, pants and a blue-and-black jacket with a tiger face in the back.
When first starting out on his adventuring, Clover was a fit young man, and lacked his beard. The top of his hair was styled in the shape of a clover. He wore a similar jacket to the one he would don later in life, alongside a simple shirt and dark pants.
At age 81, Clover had a younger appearance than when he died, with darker sections of hair still remaining. He also wore a shirt with a clover on the front.
Personality
[
]
Clover was a kind and caring man, as he did not see
Robin
as a monster as the rest of
Ohara
's citizens did. He allowed her to read the books in the
library
, study
history
, and happily graduated her into
archeology
. He forbade her from studying the forbidden
poneglyphs
only to protect her from the
World Government
's wrath. When he learned about her ability to read the poneglyphs, he regretted not knowing despite watching over her or being able to do more for her in order to not make her feel alienated as a result. When
Olvia
and Robin were forced to separate again, Clover shed a tear for the mother and daughter.

Nico Robin
[

Professor Clover allowed
Robin
to become an
archaeologist
after she passed her test;
it was his research on
Poneglyphs
that sparked her interest in the
True History
. Clover allowed her to read books in his library which sparked her interest in them. She was supported by the other archaeologists in the
Tree of Knowledge
. They were her only friends and they cared for her more than anything. Even when they threatened to ban her from the Tree of Knowledge if she continued to spy on the efforts to uncover the True History, they did so in order to prevent her from being branded as a criminal.
Nico Olvia
[
]
Professor Clover and
Nico Olvia
maintained a close professional relationship, defined by their mutual interest in the
True History
of the
world
, as inscribed on the
Poneglyphs
. Olvia’s profound dedication to
archaeology
greatly impressed Clover, who respected her commitment and tenacity.
Clover, in many ways, became a source of support and guidance for Olvia during her studies. He provided her with access to the
Tree of Knowledge
's vast library and was always open to engaging in deep intellectual discussions about their shared passions. Their bond grew stronger as they spent countless hours researching the Poneglyphs and trying to unravel the mysteries of the True History.
The mutual respect and trust between Clover and Olvia were strong enough that when she decided to leave Ohara to find the Rio Poneglyph, Clover, while saddened by her departure, trusted her judgement and gave his support. He cared for her daughter, Nico Robin, during Olvia’s absence, and instilled in Robin the same love for knowledge and curiosity about the world's True History that he and Olvia shared.
Their relationship, despite being primarily professional, was marked by a profound mutual respect and shared commitment to their research. Even when faced with the
dire consequences of their pursuit of knowledge
, Clover and Olvia chose to stand by their principles and continue their work, highlighting the deep trust and understanding between them.

Ohara Incident
.
Enemies
[
]
World Government
[
]
Due to studying the
Poneglyphs
, Clover automatically became an enemy of the
World Government
. The World Government kept close watch over Clover as he traveled the

as he could, but decided to let him live so that they could wait for Clover's
archaeologist
friends and allies to gather in one spot in order to kill them.

History

Biography
[
]
Clover the adventurer.
Clover grew up alongside his older brother, until one day his brother was killed for being a
D
. When confronted by his brother's killers, Clover lied and said that he was just a friend and was unrelated. Ashamed by lying about his relation and left questioning why someone would be killed for using their full name and possessing that initial, Clover was spurned on to learning the story behind why that was.
During his younger years, Clover was an ardent researcher and
adventurer
obsessed with the
Void Century
, which led him to conduct various expeditions around the
world
in order to seek rare texts that could shine some light about the subject. Because such research was considered forbidden by the
World Government
, Clover was arrested by the
Marines
in ten different occasions, although he managed to break out every single time, something that greatly contributed to his worldwide fame. Eventually, several
archaeologists
who held profound admiration for Clover's work and quest started following him to
Ohara
, Clover's homeland.
26 years ago, Clover hit a roadblock during his studies of the
Void Century
and travelled to
Punk Hazard
to request the assistance of his longtime friend Dr.
Vegapunk
, claiming he needed the genius' expertise in multiple scientific fields to achieve some progress. Vegapunk, now a
Marine
scientist
, refused to help and warned Clover about the consequences of his research. Having been rejected even after telling Vegapunk about his name and deceased family, Clover declared that he would eventually uncover the secrets of the Void Century no matter the cost.
Years later, after the departure of
Olvia
, Clover's student, from Ohara,
Robin
wandered into the
Tree of Knowledge
and was spotted by the professor while trying to steal a book. Clover, however, allowed her in to read the books.
He later helped Robin become an official archaeologist.
However, he forbade her from studying Ohara's
poneglyph
, not wanting her to fall prey to the World Government like her mother
Nico Olvia
did.
However, it was not to be as the World Government found out about Ohara's research and dispatched the
CP9
to take care of them. Clover tried to persuade Robin to escape as the CP9 rounded up the archaeologists. The reason for this is that Clover spoke to the World Government regarding the archaeologist's findings in the poneglyphs. He did not want Robin to know those results, for fear that she would also be targeted by the World Government.
After Clover confronted the
Five Elders
,
Marcus Mars
,
Shepherd Ju Peter
and
Topman Warcury
communicated through
Den Den Mushi
recognized the archaeologist and recognized him for his great contribution to universal culture, lamenting that he strayed from the "good path", Clover claimed the right of
humanity
to knowing the story and that no one had the right to deny them the "untold story", the old counter-argument that if they read the Poneglyphs they would resurrect the
Ancient Weapons
leading the world to its doom.
Clover is shot by Spandine before he can speak the truth.
Clover stated that before the World Government was formed, the world was ruled by a
Great Kingdom
. But they were wiped out by a group that would one day become the World Government. However, before Clover could reveal the name, he was shot by
Spandine
and mortally wounded so a shocked Robin approached. The
Buster Call
was then initiated and
Marine ships
began to
assault Ohara
, Clover regretted not keeping an eye on Robin. Taking care of
Jaguar D. Saul
, Clover arrived and ordered him to take little Robin to the refugee ship.
Clover, along with Olvia and the other archaeologists, stayed behind to save as many books as they could from the
Tree of Knowledge
for future generations. Afterward, he and the archaeologists all stayed in the tree as it burned down around them and the rest of Ohara was destroyed. They were all killed when the tree fell and crushed and burned them while they were throwing books into the lake, in the hopes of preserving
history
.
Legacy
[
]
Due to Clover's efforts before his death, his work was saved.
The
Marines
later found the books in the lake after searching the island for survivors (confirming that there were none), but they thought that it was just a coincidence.
His death, and dedication to his research, partly inspired
Dragon
to create the
Revolutionary Army
. His successful preservation of the books, led to
Saul
, who managed to survive, retrieving them alongside other
giants
, taking them back to
Elbaph
. This led to his old friend,
Dr. Vegapunk
visiting Elbaph in secret to read said books and begin his own research into the
Void Century
, effectively honoring Clover by continuing his work.
Years later, when Vegapunk himself met a
similar end
at the hands of the
World Government
, he preemptively left behind a pre-recorded message that was broadcasted to the entire
world
via
Den Den Mushi
, revealing many of the secrets of the Void Century that Clover and the rest of the
Ohara
archaeologists
were unable to reveal themselves.
