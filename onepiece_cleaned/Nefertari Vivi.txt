Introduction
History
Nefertari Vivi
is the
princess
of the
Arabasta Kingdom
.
She is the daughter of
Nefertari Cobra
and
Titi
, and along with the rest of her family, she bears the initial
D.
in her name.
During her childhood, Vivi was part of the
Sand-Sand Clan
, being the vice-leader of the group led by her friend
Koza
.
Vivi debuted as one of the main antagonists of the
Reverse Mountain Arc
as a
Bounty Hunter
, under the
Baroque Works
codename
Miss Wednesday
.
During this time, she was partnered with fellow
Frontier Agent
,
Mr. 9
. However, after the events of the
Whisky Peak Arc
, Vivi and her
pet
duck
Karoo
ended up joining the
Straw Hat Pirates
for most of the
Arabasta Saga
once she was discovered to be a spy plotting against Baroque Works.
Vivi left the Straw Hats after defeating Baroque Works to stay in her home country,
but is still considered a member of the crew and has been keeping track of their progress throughout the series.
After attending the most recent
Levely
, she became a fugitive and was forced to flee
Mary Geoise
and take shelter alongside
Wapol
aboard
Morgans
' airship.
Appearance
[
]
Vivi is a young woman of medium height with long wavy light blue hair, with two locks hanging down, one on either side of her head, which started out at about chin-length but were past her shoulders by her last appearance before the timeskip. According to her father, Vivi holds a strong resemblance to her mother.
She most often wears her hair pulled back into a ponytail, and brown eyes. She has a slender body but tends to wear less-revealing clothing than
Nami
and
Robin
do. Vivi has been seen wearing several different high heeled shoes, including white high heel boots, white high heel sandals, and blue wedges.
Though she is a princess, she rarely wore clothing that would suggest her royal status while traveling with the Straw Hats, although she started to do so more regularly after her coming-of-age speech.
After the timeskip, she wears her hair down but held back by a clip, and it seems a bit shorter than before. Like most female characters since the timeskip, her hourglass figure has become more pronounced.
A notable facet of her appearance is that when she was a member of
Baroque Works
, she seemed to have been drawn in a slightly different way. While playing the role of Miss Wednesday, she looked older, and her facial features were much more angular. She wore her ponytail in a very high position until she was attacked by
Miss Valentine
, where a few strands of her hair were slashed off with her hair bead. It was only after her true identity was revealed that she was drawn to look more like a teenage girl, with slightly bigger/rounder facial features and a less shapely body. This was more noticeable in the anime than the manga, as the animators drew her in such a different way that she could almost be mistaken for another character.
As a child, she had shoulder-length hair tied in a ponytail.
During the
Reverse Mountain
and
Whisky Peak
Arcs, she wears a shirt with dark blue and white circles (light blue and dark blue stripes in the anime), shorts fastened with a belt, and a white coat.
During the
Little Garden Arc
, she wears a light green long-sleeve shirt with blue lines, white shorts, and white boots.
At the beginning of the
Drum Island Arc
, she exchanges the shirt she wore in
Little Garden
for a maroon sweatshirt. Once they arrive in a cold climate zone, she begins to wear warm clothing, wearing a white coat with pink shoulder pads, long blue pants, and yellow gloves.
During the
Arabasta Arc
, Vivi had several different outfits:
After leaving
Drum Island
, she wore a tank-top with dark green straps and light green squared pattern, short, white pants, and white Chukka boots.
She later wore a light blue tank-top with dark blue dots and a frilly neckline, and light colored pants.
In the anime, the frills and light blue and the pants are peach colored. In the
Digitally Colored Manga
, the frills are yellow and the pants are white.
As the crew approached
Arabasta
, she wears a pink short-sleeved shirt with blue shoulders and a drawing of three X on a line, short blue pants, and white Chukka boots. Starting this point she had
bandage
on her left forearm.
During the Straw Hats brief stay at
Nanohana
, she wore a dancer outfit with a green and yellow top and long skirt, a light blue cover-up, a golden neckless, and a gold armband on her right forearm.
In the anime, the outfit is blue and pink, the cover-up is white, and the neckless has red gems.
During the Straw Hats mission to stop
Crocodile
's
Operation Utopia
, she wore a dark blue desert outfit, with a tan colored jellabiya.
While recovering from the fights, she wore a pink, long sleeved night gown.
She later wore a purple shirt, with a white and green pattern dress.
At the end of the arc, she wore a princess outfit, with a white and pink dress with suspenders, and white high-heeled sandals with gold ornaments and accessories. She began wearing her hair down.
During the
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
, she wears a light pink shirt with dark pink lines and figures, a white skirt, and purple high-heeled sandals.
Durning the
Post-War Arc
, she wears a white dress.
Two years later, when she attends the
Levely
, she wears a long-sleeved pink dress, with gold accessories at the waist and arms, a cape, red on the outside and dark blue on the inside, and white high heel pumps. When she arrived at Levely, she took off her cape.
During the
Egghead Arc
, after being taken in by Morgans, she wears clothes lent to her by
Iyan'eno Chinode
, consisting of a sleeveless ruffle top, a long skirt and high-heeled sandals.

Personality
[
]
One of Vivi's anger moments.
Vivi does not fit the stereotype of a needy and authoritative princess, never demanding any special attention or prioritizing herself above others. In fact, she usually puts the needs of others far above her own and is hesitant to rely on others or ask for help with her own problems. In particular, she places an enormous value on the citizens of her country and the lives of her friends. Vivi's selfless nature could be seen especially when she asked the Straw Hats to make a detour to get medical help for Nami instead of continuing straight to Arabasta, even though she knew her country was in a state of emergency. This selflessness applies to herself as shown when in a precarious of being kidnapped by
CP0
and possibly made into a
slave
, Vivi was more worried for her friend
Shirahoshi
who was being targeted by a
World Noble
.
She is also extremely brave and determined, going up against powerful enemies for her friends' sake, even when clearly outmatched. Her selflessness and sense of responsibility push her to carry her country's burden. She is slow to anger and quick to forgive but fiercely loyal to her friends, her family, and her country. Because of this loyalty and bravery, she is willing to make virtually any sacrifice, such as when she was willing to allow her feet to be cut off to escape Mr. 3's candle prison. Vivi can stay calm in bad situation and act quickly when she sees a way out.
As a child, her father often worried that her heart was too soft, with
Igaram
reassuring him that it would be good for Arabasta when she took the throne. She is also inclined to find non-violent ways whenever possible, begging
Luffy
not to fight
Crocodile
, thus this was largely out of concern for Luffy. Throughout the Arabasta Arc, she wanted to stop Crocodile's plans with words over violence, wanting to save everyone. Both Luffy and Crocodile pointed out Vivi was too naïve, as she didn't want anyone to die and was unwilling to risk the lives of others despite being willing to risk her own. Crocodile further mocked her for trying so hard to save everyone she end up endangering everyone.
As a member of Arabasta's royal family, she loves her country and is willing to do anything to protect it, even infiltrating a vast criminal organization. She does not mind doing tasks that seem unsuitable for a princess, such as washing dishes.
Vivi grew up knowing that she was responsible for the well-being of her country. As such, she developed impressive skills as a diplomat. Even as a child, she understood what being a princess meant and acted with wisdom beyond her years: when slapped by Wapol, she apologized for being in his way and held back her tears until he was out of earshot, all for the sake of preventing an international incident. When they reached Drum Island, she was able to persuade Luffy to not attack the villagers and even put on a brave face after being shot in the arm. Her courage convinced the villagers to allow them into the village peacefully.
During arguments, Vivi has a hard time coming up with insults and usually ends up saying something of little offense. She has a habit of giving people nicknames, calling
Zoro
"Mr.
Bushido
", for example.
She also has a habit of biting her bottom lip when she is worried. Despite her kind and earnest nature, she can be deceptive when necessary. At age fourteen, she was able to infiltrate Baroque Works and, over the course of two years, quickly rose to frontier agent status without anybody realizing her true identity.
A running gag throughout much of the Arabasta Arc was that Vivi constantly forgot to warn the Straw Hats about various dangers of the desert, such as giant scorpions and lizards, until after they appeared.
Luffy
, Zoro, and
Sanji
quickly dispatched any threatening creatures but berated her for her inability to remember such things beforehand.
Vivi is also self-conscious about her lack of physical strength. After being nearly eaten alive by one
Bananawani
, she witnessed Luffy and Zoro defeated a group of them easily, causing Vivi to wail to Usopp about not being able to handle even one.
After the timeskip, it is shown that her time with the Straw Hats have changed her, as Vivi's adventurous side from her times as a pirate showed itself when she was about to head to Mary Geoise for Levely. She apparently misses her time on the sea, as she felt reminiscent from the breeze from the salty ocean. She even jumped down from the mast of the ship, worrying those around her who were not with her during her time as a pirate.
Vivi will not hesitate to stand up for someone whom she just befriended as she spoke out against
Charlos
' attempt to enslave Shirahoshi. When
Neptune
expressed his disgust at the World Noble's actions and went on to attack him, saying he would never bring his kind to the surface again, Vivi was brought to tears, saying that not all humans are like the World Nobles.
Being fair-minded and honest person, Vivi expressed her dislike of the
World Economy News Paper
due to their lack of journalistic integrity, especially when the president,
Morgans
, falsified a story where Luffy took
Vegapunk
hostage while waging war against the Marines, which Vivi knew Luffy would never do. Her chagrin was such that she broke out of her crying over her father's death to protest against Morgans.
Relationships
[
]
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Straw Hat Pirates, Vivi, and Karoo show their friendship mark.
Vivi traveled with and assisted the
Straw Hat Pirates
for almost the entire Arabasta Saga and strongly considered joining their crew after Crocodile's defeat. Though she ultimately declined their offer in favor of working to restore
her country
, she remains closer to the Straw Hats than anyone else outside of their crew.
She and Karoo are now regarded as honorary members of the Straw Hat Pirates, at least by Luffy and the others. Her close relationship with the Straw Hats were further emphasized when she was one of the few people who realized Luffy had a message for the crew during his second appearance at Marineford, but she did not understand the message since she had no context. Upon learning of what the Straw Hats did at Dressrosa, she immediately knew what they were doing. When it was reported that Vivi went missing in Mary Geoise, most of the members who knew her panicked and wanted to go save her, with only Zoro and Robin maintaining their calm to keep the crew in check.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Luffy saves Vivi.
When traveling with the Straw Hats, Vivi had a great amount of respect for
Monkey D. Luffy
, both as a captain and as her friend, openly showing both amazement and disbelief at his great strength and fighting abilities, which would sometimes make her doubt her own fighting skills and feel the need to show that she can handle herself despite the clear difference in fighting capabilities. Despite this, she also openly showed concern for his reckless behavior and fearlessness during their travels, feeling the need to watch over him from time to time. Whenever she saw Luffy doing something that might compromise the crew's safety, even when he meant to help, she reminded him of a leader's responsibilities. When they reached
Drum Island
, she was able to persuade Luffy not to attack the villagers, showing how much trust he had in her. At Arabasta, Luffy forced her to admit she needed help in taking down Crocodile and asked her to let him and the crew carry some of her burden. That confrontation cemented their relationship of strong mutual trust. Her high opinion of Luffy did not change when she learned that his father was
the world's worst criminal
. Instead, she was concerned for his safety. During the
Levely Arc
, she openly stated her friendship with Luffy to
Rebecca
and
Shirahoshi
. Like many who knew him, she believes that Luffy will be the King of the Pirates. She also trusted Luffy's
grandfather
over
Rob Lucci
for protection.
Two years later when
Morgans
was plotting to write a headline that Luffy was going to kidnap Vegapunk to make the World Government look bad, which offended Vivi, as she stated that Luffy would never do such a thing.
Although she was shocked when the headline came true.
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
Vivi was originally antagonistic towards
Zoro
when she was still undercover as a bounty hunter and Baroque Works agent. At
Whisky Peak
, she boldly tried to kill him and greatly underestimated him in the process. This quickly changed after her failed attempts to attack him and after she witnessed him effortlessly defeating dozens of bounty hunters, including her fellow agents. After her identity was revealed and she began to travel with the crew, Zoro got along well with Vivi, who in turn nicknamed him "Mr. Bushido".
However, as the Straw Hats departed from Arabasta, he seemed unperturbed that they had to leave her behind. When the rest of the crew was depressed because of her absence, he commented that they should have taken her by force if they wanted her to stay that badly.
After learning about what happen at Levely after leaving Wano Country, Zoro was the only Straw Hat who knew her that didn't panic, as he trusted Vivi could take care of herself, as oppose to the rest who wanted to find her.
Nami
[
]
Vivi and Nami teaming up.
She and
Nami
also became very good friends. Their personalities seem to be opposites. Nami has a hot-tempered disposition, while Vivi is calmer and more collected. They switch personalities when something worrisome happens: Nami is the one to calm down while Vivi panics. The two formed a quick bond and worked together in most situations. During Nami's fight with
Miss Double Finger
, Nami said that being stabbed in the foot could not compare to the pain Vivi felt for her country. Initially, Nami wanted Vivi to pay
1,000,000,000 for the Straw Hats' assistance. However, because of the bond that they made throughout the journey, Nami decided to give up on the demands for the sake of her friendship with Vivi.
Usopp
[
]
Vivi and
Usopp
worked well together on more than one occasion and were concerned for each other's well-being. After seeing Luffy dragging Usopp by the nose, she developed a tendency to also grab his nose, using it as a means of getting his attention or a handle by which he could be dragged.
Sanji
[
]
Aside from
Sanji
's fighting skills and strength, Vivi was also greatly impressed by his cooking skills. In turn, Sanji immediately warmed up to her and greatly showed his attraction towards her on multiple occasions. However, Vivi showed mostly confusion from Sanji's actions towards her. She quickly became one of his three main affections, and he defended her to the same degree as he did Nami (and later Robin). Two years later, Sanji showed great delight in seeing Vivi's picture in the newspaper.
Tony Tony Chopper
[
]
She finds
Chopper
adorable and calls him Tony-kun, which always launches him into one of his happy dances.
Nico Robin
[
]
She was not upset when she learned that Luffy took
Nico Robin
, the former Miss All Sunday and their one-time enemy, into his crew. Rather than questioning his motives, she decided to trust Luffy's judgement on the matter.
Family
[
]
Cobra
[
]
Vivi with her father, Cobra.
King Cobra
has great faith in his daughter's strong determination and will. He shows nearly same level of paranoia about Vivi's safety as Igaram and was relieved to learn of her safety after her time with Baroque Works. Vivi has also described Cobra as a worrywart for this reason.
Vivi seemingly cried for days when she learned about the death of her father, having been unaware about it while stowing away from the Levely.
Titi
[
]
Vivi's mother,
Queen Titi
, died many years before the current storyline. The duration and nature of their relationship are unknown.
Subjects
[
]
Chaka and Pell
[
]
The two great warriors of Arabasta,
Chaka
and
Pell
, have always watched over Vivi. Pell is especially fond of her, even taking her for a
ride
despite the king having forbidden it.
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
[
]
Like Karoo, Vivi has accepted the entire
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
as her pets as well as a means of transportation. The troops in turn are very loyal to Vivi and Karoo, so much so that they assisted them and the Straw Hats in traveling through the desert, and later in the fight against Baroque Works. The newest member,
Matsuge
, also helped in the fight against Baroque Works and has been very close with the princess ever since, even sometimes seen shopping with her and Karoo.
Igaram
[
]
Igaram protects Vivi after their identity is discovered by Baroque Works agents.
Likewise,
Igaram
was fond of the Princess and often acted with such deep concern for her well-being that it bordered on paranoia. He also willingly risked his life to protect her when their infiltration of Baroque Works was discovered.
Friends
[
]
Karoo
[
]
Vivi and Karoo when they were very young.
Vivi is also very close with her pet,
Karoo
the spot-billed duck. She cares deeply for him, as shown when she refused to leave with the Straw Hats without him. Whenever he is put in danger without good reason, she immediately and vehemently berates the person who did so. As they have been together since childhood, the two have an exceptionally strong bond, and he is willing to do most anything for her, though this bond does not stop Vivi from scolding him when he disobeys or misunderstands her simplest orders. Despite this, she knows she can count on him and entrusts him with very important tasks.
Koza
[
]
Koza
, the leader of the rebellion, has been a close personal friend of Vivi's for 11 years. Though they originally met on bad terms, there soon came to be a level of respect between them. The two became close childhood friends, even co-leading a large childhood group called the
Sand-Sand Clan
. Vivi owes her life to him for saving her from some kidnappers as a child. Her friendship with him led Baroque Works to fear the repercussions of the pair meeting up again, and they did everything possible to prevent the two from seeing each other.
Dalton
[
]
Vivi originally met
Dalton
years ago as a little girl when they attended the
Levely
, with Dalton as Wapol's escort, and Vivi accompanying her father, Cobra. Though Wapol intentionally tried to stir up trouble due to a disagreement with Cobra, Vivi ignored his rude act to avoid a conflict, something that would impress and eventually inspire Dalton to turn against Wapol.
Later when she and the Straw Hats landed on Drum Island to find a doctor for Nami, Dalton saw Vivi working towards preventing a conflict between the crew and the townspeople and allowed them onto the island, feeling he could trust them. Though Vivi chose not to disclose her true identity to him during their time on Drum Island even after she reacted upon remembering Wapol, Dalton was capable of figuring out her identity on his own and was glad she was traveling with the Straw Hats when they were departing from Drum Island.
They would later meet again and get reacquainted two years later when they both attended the current Levely to which she greets both him and Dr.
Kureha
. When Wapol approached Vivi and started insulting her, Dalton stood up for her by intimidating Wapol into backing off.
Friends of the Straw Hats
[
]
At
Mary Geoise
, Vivi was quick to bond with
Rebecca
,
Leo
, and
Shirahoshi
due to having a
mutual friend
that they are indebted to. When Charlos tried to make Shirahoshi his slave, Vivi was outraged and protested against the World Noble's actions to which Shirahoshi's father
Neptune
thanked Vivi for her efforts just as he was preparing to take action. Later Vivi was still worried about Shirahoshi's safety after hearing of Charlos' second attempt to kidnap her, only to learn from
CP0
about Shirahoshi being saved by
Sai
and
Leo
.
Mr. 9 and Miss Monday
[
]
Mr. 9 protects Vivi from Mr. 5.
In Baroque Works,
Mr. 9
and
Miss Monday
had become close friends with Vivi (as Miss Wednesday) and Igaram (as Mr. 8). Their friendship was so strong that both of them were prepared to give their lives to save her when she is attacked by
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
.
Enemies
[
]
Crocodile
[
]
Vivi truly hates
Crocodile
, the secret boss of Baroque Works, for the chaos and ruin he caused in her country. On multiple occasions, she has openly wished for his death or voiced her desire to kill him.
Baroque Works Agents
[
]
After she infiltrated the organization, her true identity was discovered, and she was attacked by
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
at
Whiskey Peak
. Then they had a second meeting in
Little Garden
, where she also had to face
Mr. 3
and
Miss Goldenweek
.
Mr. 7
and
Miss Father's Day
were apparently friends with her at some point. However, by the time they meet at Arabasta, the sniper pair already knew that she was a spy.
World Government
[
]
Following the most recent
Levely
, Vivi has become an enemy of the
World Government
due to both
Imu
and the
Five Elders
learning about her connection to the
Will of D.
and the fact that she was imprisoned by CP0 where they intended for her to "disappear" and ultimately become a slave to a
World Noble
, to which she stated in disgust "over my dead body". As a result of her and Wapol knowing the truth behind her father's murder, the two became fugitives and are currently in hiding from the World Government. Imu ordered the Five Elders to find Vivi and bring her to them.
Rob Lucci
[
]
Vivi holds nothing but hostility towards
Rob Lucci
, in part of his participation in
Charlos
's attempted enslavement of
Shirahoshi
during the Levely. Despite being a member of
CP0
, Vivi was unafraid of him, going far as to physically confront him and demand he and his agents release her friend. Later when Vivi found Lucci following her to
Red Port
, claiming he was there to protect her, she sardonically rejected his help, still in contempt for his previous actions. Her distrust in Lucci was later to be well founded as the princess soon was kidnapped and held temporarily captive by his colleagues.
Other
[
]
Wapol
[
]
Wapol is a former enemy of Vivi, now a forced traveling companion. At a young age, Vivi first crossed paths with the then
king
of
Drum Kingdom
during a previous Levely, and due to the latter's confrontation with Cobra, the meeting ended with Wapol shoving her, and wounding her. Thanks to Vivi's nobility however, the event was calmed instead of becoming an incident between the kingdoms.
Afterward, during Vivi's time with the Straw Hats, the two encounter each other again, and while Vivi recognized him,
it was only after Dalton revealed the history of Drum, and the attack by the
Blackbeard Pirates
, that she fully remembered him, and became angry with his actions despite being the king.
By the time of their third meeting in another Levely, they remained hostile toward each other.
In a twist of fate, Wapol would unintentionally save Vivi from CP0 while running away after witnessing her father's murder.
Following the events of the recent Levely, due to knowing the truth about the death of Vivi's father Cobra, the two were forced into hiding together from the World Government aboard Morgans' airship.
Morgans
[
]
On the run from the World Government, Vivi found herself tagging along with Wapol, and seeking asylum in the airship belonging to the head of the
World Economy News Paper
. Despite being taken in by Morgans, Vivi is not shy about voicing her disdain of the journalist in creating a fake story and using Luffy to sensationalize it even if it could possibly result in him retracting his protection over her. She even called Morgans a liar when written a fake article of Luffy's murdering Vegapunk.
The following events are

Vivi met
Rasa
when they were children, during a royal tour around the country along with her father. Rasa is seen giving the princess a wreath. After
Melias
was abandoned by its people, she stayed in the village, waiting for the king to return, feeling that the king and the princess abandoned them. When they meet again in the present,
Barbarossa
sends Rasa and
Zaba
to accompany Luffy and Vivi as they go to look for wood. While traveling to
Yuba
, she sends Vivi and Luffy's Sand Sled towards a sandpit, on vain of her unkept promise from when she was a child. Vivi would later apologize for her father's mistake and promised to make things right. She eventually forgives Vivi and is seen smiling hoping for a bright future. She waves goodbye to Vivi and the Straw Hats as they head towards
Ido
.
Fata
[
]
Fata
developed a crush on Vivi and decided to write a love letter to her. He was embarrassed when it was found, and when Vivi learned about it, she was sad to cause one of her subjects pain unintentionally.
Concludes non-canon section.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a princess, Vivi has a great deal of authority in her country. With the death of her father, she is currently the highest authority of the
Arabasta Kingdom
.
She has a natural skill in diplomacy. This was clear even as a child, as Vivi understood what being a princess meant and acted with wisdom beyond her years during her childhood trip to the Levely. When she was slapped by Wapol, she quickly apologized for being in his way and held back her tears until he was out of earshot, all for the sake of preventing an international incident. When meeting the Straw Hats, she managed to persuade Zoro and Nami into protecting her from the Baroque Works agents after her cover was blown, and even persuaded Nami against charging her for their protection. When traveling with the Straw Hats, she even showed an impressive, and almost comedic amount of skill in keeping the more childish members of the crew (Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper) as well as Karoo, focused, calm, and motivated during their travels together. When they reached Drum Island, she was able to persuade Luffy not to attack the villagers back and even put on a brave face after being shot in the arm. Her courage convinced the villagers to allow them into the village peacefully. In the aftermath of the battle against Baroque Works, Vivi even managed to persuade the royal guards and rebels of her country to ultimately stop fighting and killing one another, effectively ending the needless civil war that was started by
Crocodile
.
Vivi has proven herself to be a very capable spy and has shown great skill in stealth and other clandestine skills as well. This was proven clearly as Vivi was extremely good at moving about undetected, having established herself as a single digit member of Baroque Works for two years before her identity was compromised and she returned to Arabasta completely unnoticed by the citizens. Her actions as a spy were completely unnoticed by the Marines, the World Government, and even the
Warlord of the Sea
Crocodile for more than two years until her cover was finally blown by
Miss All Sunday
. Since leaving the Straw Hats, she seems to have managed to maintain her role as a princess, all the while successfully keeping both her past as a Baroque Works agent and a companion of a pirate crew secret from the Marines and the World Government.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Despite her lack of combat experience compared to the Straw Hats, Vivi has proven herself more than capable of being able to hold her own in battle. When infiltrating Baroque Works, she held her own within the organization, and quickly rose up the ranks within two years. As a Baroque Works
frontier agent
, she and her partner surpassed three other pairs in skill, and was experienced as both agents and bounty hunters, as they were the pair tasked with killing Laboon. Her confidence in her own fighting abilities were so great that she even openly tried to attack Roronoa Zoro, till she realized the clear difference in strength between the two of them. Vivi can also make use of
Karoo
, in spite of his frequent incompetence, to gain more mobility in battle. She was able to hold her own against a group of Billions, although she was eventually overwhelmed by their sheer numbers and had to be saved by
Pell
.
On her own, she has surprising natural agility, often dodging attacks gracefully and almost mindlessly, often appearing surprised after it happens. Her instinct seems to be to tackle her opponent and hold them down, as seen during her confrontations with Luffy and
Koza
. Her time as a Baroque Works agent also seems to have given her a preference for surprise attacks and ambushes, as seen during her confrontations with Zoro and Crocodile. However, since both her attempts failed, her actual ability in these skills is currently unknown.
Vivi is resilient and able to endure a lot of pain, such as a bullet wound to the arm and a skinned knee caused when she fell due to her wedges falling apart, slowing her down momentarily. Her feet are also tough enough that she can go barefoot with ease, as she was able to trek through
Alubarna
unhindered after her wedges fell apart, run across cobblestone streets without any visible pain, and stand perched steadily atop a narrow ledge on the city's clock tower. After all this, she only suffered minor scrapes and tarnishes to her feet and needed no bandages on them afterwards. After the timeskip, Vivi has seemingly become much more physically agile and resilient, as evidenced by her deftly jumping from a crow's nest hundreds of feet high and landing on her feet in front of her father and guards.
In terms of physical strength, she is highly outmatched by other members of the Straw Hat Pirates. This was made very evident when she struggled against a single
Bananawani
while Luffy and Zoro could defeat a group of them effortlessly. This huge difference in strength briefly made Vivi comically depressed, as she even had trouble with just running from one.
Weapons
[

Further information:
Peacock Slashers
Vivi rides Karoo as Miss Wednesday while spinning her Peacock Slashers.
Vivi's weapons of choice are her twirling "Kujakki (Peacock) Slashers," which are small, sharp discs attached to her fingers by wires. She is left-handed but capable of dual wielding the slashers.
At Arabasta, she started using the longer range Kujakki String Slashers, which carry enough power to behead someone with a single slash. If her Peacock Slashers miss the target, as seen when she was fighting
Miss Father's Day
and
Mr. 7
, she can use a special backup move she has dubbed
Run Back
. This technique has been proven to be extremely useful, as it defeated the two frontier agents of Baroque Works.
Before joining the Straw Hats, she had another attack, first seen being used on Zoro: the
Miwaku no Memaii Dansu
, in which she performs a hypnotic dance utilizing the concentric patterns on her outfit. The effect immobilizes her opponent and creates an opening for her final attack. In the anime (where the design of her outfit is altered), this attack is changed to the
Miwaku no Kousui Dansu
and relies on a special perfume for effect.
She and Mr. 9 briefly wielded bazookas during their attempt to kill
Laboon
.
Vivi was once seen hitting Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji with a large mace, after which the weapon was never seen again.
It was replaced with a broom in the anime.

Anime and Manga Differences
[

Miss Wednesday's top is circled in the manga.
Miss Wednesday's top is striped in the anime.
Miss Wednesday's top is circled in
Movie 2
end credits.
Miss Wednesday's top is circled in the extended version of
Movie 8
.
In the manga, when Vivi is still a member of Baroque Works, her top is different than that of the anime. The reason why the anime changed it is unknown, but it is most probably because of how the circles on her chest resemble nipples.
This difference in the outfit caused one of her attacks, Miwaku no Memai Dance, to change in the anime, as explained in the article
Peacock Slashers
.
She does have her original outfit design in some other media formats, such as
Movie 2
end credits,
Set Sail Pirate Crew!
and
One Piece: Treasure Battle!
video games, and the extended version of
Movie 8
.
