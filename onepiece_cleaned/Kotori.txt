Personalities

They also have no qualms with attacking those who are already wounded and unconscious. They do care about each other as brothers do, as they both desired to avenge Satori's defeat and Hotori became enraged when Kotori was defeated.

Skypiea Arc

Nami and Gan Fall vs. Hotori and Kotori.
Hotori and Kotori firstly appear when they target Nami and Gan Fall in order take revenge for their brother Satori who was defeated by
Luffy
,
Usopp
, and
Sanji
.
As soon as Nami attacks one of them with her Clima-Tact, the attack was absorbed by the Flavor dial which was used to oppose the attack. Following that Hotori pointed the Flavor Dial back at Nami and a putrid gas came out, irritating Nami's nose and almost disorienting her with the stench. Both of the brothers started laughing about that, because they knew that they had various dials which would confuse their enemy. Consequently they spin around holding each others hand in order to confuse Nami and Gan Fall even more.
As Gan Fall attacked Kotori he used his dials to dodge and attack simultaneously. When he attacked Gan Fall using the Flame Dial the combination of gas and flame created an explosion. Kotori and Hotori thought they have defeated Gan Fall, however they underestimated him.
Gan Fall
used the smoke which arose during the explosion to start an immediate counter attack at Kotori, defeating him instantly. At the same time
Nami
used her Clima-Tact to attack with 'cyclone' which sent Hotori flying into the river. Hotori, however, did not want to give up yet and came out of the river in which he fell, to avenge both his brothers but Nami used Gan Fall's Impact Dial to finish off Hotori after confusing him with the fog she created using her Clima-Tact.
