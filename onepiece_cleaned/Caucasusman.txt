History
[

Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
During the
Raid on Onigashima
, the
Beasts Pirates
's Armored Division, under
Sasaki
's command, pursued
Kouzuki Momonosuke
and
Shinobu
. Before
Usunoro
could kill Shinobu,
Yamato
knocked him aside and defended Momonosuke.
The Armored Division surrounded their three targets and fired shots from behind their shields; however, Yamato continued blocking their shots and taking down more members. The fight was interrupted by the arrival of
Franky
and
Hatcha
, the latter of whom smashed a hole in the floor, through which Yamato, Momonosuke, and Shinobu escaped.
Franky stayed behind to occupy the Armored Division.
During Franky's fight with Sasaki, members of the Armored Division leapt onto
General Franky
's body to hold him still, with Caucasusman grabbing its left knee. A crowd of Gifters, who had been tamed with
Tama
's
dango
, swarmed in and freed Franky, narrowly avoiding Sasaki's charge.
Usopp
then fired dango into the mouths of the Armored Division, including Caucasusman's, and Tama ordered all of them to follow her, which they did enthusiastically.
After Tama gave her order for her friends to help the Straw Hats, Caucasusman followed
Nokokuwa Police
's lead back to the Right-Brain Tower to help aid Franky in fighting the Beasts Pirates. He and the rest of the Armored Division were eventually taken out by Sasaki's
Heliceratops
.
Caucasusman was later seen along with other recovered members of the Armored Division asking Franky to help them escape the fire trapping them in the Right-Brain Tower.
Caucasusman and the rest of the Armored Division was eventually swept away by the torrent of water flowing throughout Onigashima while Franky yelled for them to hold strong.
