Appearance
[
]
Turco's disguise as Wire.
Turco is a tall, skinny man with a long neck, thick lips and no visible chin. He wears a flowered shirt and a blue haircut similar to the real Franky of two years before the present, but has no resemblance to the pirate after he remodeled himself. He wears sunglasses similar to Franky's, and is seen smoking a cigarette. While the real Franky always wears a swim briefs and keeps his shirt open, Turco is seen wearing regular pants and has his shirt buttoned up and brown shoes.
When impersonating
Wire
, Turco wears a similar headdress and shirt.
Personality
[
]
Turco, as a member of the Fake Straw Hats, uses the reputation of the real crew to intimidate others. He was oddly dismissive of
Usopp
despite being hit by one of his attacks at the time. Upon the truth coming out, he was discovered to be very cowardly, begging
Caribou
for mercy.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
It seemed that his task within the Fake Straw Hat Crew was to keep track of information, such as who they have recruited. Turco was never seen fighting or wielding a weapon, though he seems to have at least some endurance as he was able to stand up after being attacked by Usopp's carnivorous plants and being struck by Nami's massive lightning bolt attack, albeit wounded. He has a weak will as he easily fainted from Luffy's
Haki
.
Typical for a fraud, he is very weak as he was easily brought to his knees by the
Caribou Pirates
. Despite being weak, he also has some knowledge of
Devil Fruits
as shown as when he quickly recognized that
Caribou
has a
Logia
Devil Fruit, when he absorbed a cannonball.
History
[

Past
[
]
Sometime in the past, Turco was recruited by
Demaro Black
to join the
Fake Straw Hat Crew
, due to his physical similarities to the real
Franky
.
Fish-Man Island Saga
[
]
Return to Sabaody Arc
[
]
Turco was in charge of taking down the names of the pirate crews who wanted to join the Fake Straw Hat's ranks. When his crew advanced on
Nami
for rejecting their invitation, they were attacked by a large carnivorous plant created by
Usopp
's
Pop Greens
. Turco was surprised that Usopp was the man Nami had been waiting for. The crew was then struck by a massive lighting bolt created by Nami.
Turco was later watching his captain,
Demaro Black
(the fake Luffy), accidentally shoot a couple he mistook for Usopp and Nami and then being knocked over by the real
Monkey D. Luffy
. When Fake Luffy tried to shoot the real Luffy, Turco and the other imposter Straw Hats present with him were subdued by the real Luffy's
Haki
.
He was soon woken up by
Manjaro
(the fake Zoro) and
Drip
(the fake Sanji). He shivered from the after-effects of Luffy's Haki. In Grove 46, the crew stood by as Fake Luffy gave his speech to their new recruits.
When Demaro Black was revealed to be a fake, Turco ran away with the rest of the crew out of fear of being beaten up by the recruits. When the real Luffy was revealed, Turco started foaming at the mouth due to shock.
Turco, along with the remaining Fake Straw Hats, begging for their lives.
Turco and the other Fake Straw Hats (save Black,
Cocoa
, and
Gitsune
) somehow escaped the battle but were held captive by
Caribou
and
Coribou
. The fakes begged for their lives as Coribou prepared to bury them alive.
