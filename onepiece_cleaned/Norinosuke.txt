Personality
[
]
Norinosuke appears to be a particularly religious individual, evident by the religious garb he wears. He is more religiously inclined than the average Wano citizen; while he notes that many people no longer believe in the divinity of
white boars
, he appears to, and encourages those around him to return
Koyama
to the mountain. When
Kin'emon
attempted to battle the
Mountain God
, Norinosuke urged him to stop, stating that the entire country would fall into ruin if it was harmed.
Additionally, Norinosuke believes in the stories surrounding
Kouzuki Oden
, and was not surprised when Oden claimed responsibility for luring the Mountain God into the capital.

History

Past
[
]
Forty-one years ago, Norinosuke was in the
Flower Capital
when
Kin'emon
accidentally lured the
Mountain God
into the city. While the citizens panicked, he preached in the streets to return
the God's child
to the mountains to quell its anger.
When Kin'emon learned that the Mountain God had eaten
Tsurujo
and attempted to attack it, Norinosuke ordered him to stop alongside another priest, warning that Wano would fall into ruin if the God was harmed. When Kin'emon's assault failed and
Kouzuki Oden
claimed responsibility for kidnapping the baby boar, Norinosuke insulted him and motivated the townspeople to throw rocks at him.
Thirty years ago, Norinosuke became a father when
Holed'em
was born.
