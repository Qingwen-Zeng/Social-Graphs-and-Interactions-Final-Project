History
[

Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
When the
World Government
had ordered to eliminate
Vegapunk
, Tosa, alongside
Jaygarcia Saturn
,
Kizaru
, and eight other
Vice Admirals
, led a Marine fleet to besiege the island of
Egghead
.
Before the attack, he had all of the
Rokushiki
users put on standby.
After the Marines made landfall, he and other high-ranking Marines witnessed
Jewelry Bonney
stab Saturn and attempted to open fire on her, but Saturn told them all to back down, saying that he would have dodged if he was afraid of her sword.
Tosa is struck down by Brogy.
Saturn then ordered a
Buster Call
on Egghead, prompting the Marines to evacuate.
During the attack, the
Pacifista
under Bonney's command were attacking the ships. The Vice Admirals planned to kill Bonney so they could regain control of the Pacifista, and Tosa reported that he was going after Bonney's group. Before he could get to her, he was struck down by
Brogy
, leaving him wedged in the ground.
Following Bonney's escape from Egghead, along with the
Straw Hat Pirates
and the
Giant Warrior Pirates
, Tosa and the other Vice Admirals met with Saturn to evaluate the results of their mission. Tosa lamented their failure in capturing the pirates and his fellow officers asked Saturn for permission to pursue them to Elbaf, but Saturn refused, considering Vegapunk's posthumous broadcast a more concerning matter. He then saw Saturn attacking
Doberman
after he asked whether Vegapunk's message was true or not, and later witnessed in horror the elder's sudden and gruesome death, without knowing its
cause
.
