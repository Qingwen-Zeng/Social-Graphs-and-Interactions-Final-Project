The
Rocks Pirates
were a legendary and powerful
pirate
crew that sailed the
seas
until their
defeat
at
God Valley
38 years ago.
They were led by
Rocks D. Xebec
and considered to be the most dangerous and strongest pirate crew of their time. They ruled the seas before the rise of
Gol D. Roger
and his
crew
.

The crew's
Jolly Roger
is depicted as a burning red skull with flames that resemble two horns. It is shown as the O for "Rocks" on the sail of the

Organization
[
]
The organization was founded by a dangerous band of
pirates
who gathered at
Hachinosu
. Their mutual quest for fame and fortune led to the formation of the crew. However, according to
Sengoku
, the Rocks Pirates were very violent and vicious as they would kill friends and foes alike, and their lack of camaraderie caused crew members to kill each other constantly, even while at
sea
.
Because of the poor relationship with each other, the former Rocks Pirates members tend to downplay their time together to the rest of the
world
. Coupled with the
World Government
covering up their actions, the crew became relatively unknown to the next generation.
Edward Newgate
briefly described his time in the crew when talking to
Kouzuki Oden
. He said it was a group of people who were not the type to serve others, and that he had plenty of bad experiences there.
Crew Strength
[
]
Members of the Rocks Pirates.
The Rocks Pirates were an extremely powerful crew with amazing potential and were regarded as a threat to the entire
world
. They were without a doubt the strongest
pirate
crew of their time; three of their members later became
Emperors
, and the crew's captain,
Rocks D. Xebec
, was widely considered the first and most formidable rival of the future Pirate King,
Gol D. Roger
. Eventually, it took the combined strength of Roger and
Monkey D. Garp
to defeat them.
Ship
[
]
The crew had at least one
ship
with a dark colored sail, with the word "ROCKS" written on it in light colored letters, the "O" was designed to look like a burning skull, and it had a figure head of a corpse.
In
Kaidou
's flashback, the crew had a ship with dark colored sails except for the mizzenmast sail at the rear of the ship. The stern appears to be decorated as well, with three huge lanterns topped by the crew's
Jolly Roger
protruding from the top. The ship's design appears to be a
fourth-rate
ship-of-the-line with carrack rigging.

Legacy
[
]
The remnants of the Rocks Pirates.
Due to
Rocks D. Xebec
's quest for domination that led him to dabble in forbidden studies that the World Government had covered up, along with the crew's lack of camaraderie which caused them to rarely speak of their time together, the Rocks Pirates became relatively unknown to younger generations, falling into obscurity in spite of their massive power.
Five years after the crew had disbanded, the former members would go on to form their own crews.
Three of them—
Edward Newgate
, Charlotte Linlin, and Kaidou—went on to become
Emperors
until their downfalls. Newgate was killed by
Marshall D. Teach
, Kaidou was defeated by
Monkey D. Luffy
(a future Emperor), and Linlin was defeated by Luffy's rivals
Eustass Kid
and
Trafalgar D. Water Law
.
Ochoku
returned to Hachinosu and took over as boss, until he was overthrown by Teach.
