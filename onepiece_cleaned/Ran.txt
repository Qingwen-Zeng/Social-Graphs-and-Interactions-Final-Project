Ran
is a member of the
Kuja Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Ran is an average sizedÂ lady who has jet black hair parted on one side with an earring on each ear. She wears long black stockings with straps that reach her matching color panties. Around her waist is a decorative belt of rings that is attached to a small flap of blue cloth to cover her rear. Her top is a small orange flowered tank top with a window hole in the middle that seems almost too small for her size. She carries a quiver of arrows slung around her back with a snake that is usually accompanying her. She wears a overcoat, similar to a Marine, like a cape like many of her fellow crewmates.
Personality
[
]
Ran is a perceptive woman, knowing that
Luffy
defeated
Bacura
with brute force. She also seems to be one of the more knowledgeable and prominent
Kuja
in the
pirate
crew, telling a little girl about the
Gorgon Sisters
and their cursed backs (though unknown to Ran, it was in truth a mark of
slavery
that the three sisters hide in shame).
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a member of the Kuja Pirates, it can be implied that she is very strong as only the strongest warriors are allowed on the Kuja ship. As with most of the other Kuja warriors, Ran uses a
snake
that can morph into a bow to launch arrows. Like all members of the Kuja Tribe, Ran can utilize
Haki
.
History
[
]
Summit War Saga
[
]
Amazon Lily Arc
[
]
In the
Calm Belt
near
Amazon Lily
, Ran spoke with
Vice Admiral
Momonga
on the
Kuja Pirates
ship. Ran noticed that Momonga had killed a
Sea King
. Momonga then handed over a newspaper to Ran while requesting a meeting with
Boa Hancock
.
After Hancock turned Momonga's crew
into stone
, the Kuja Pirates sailed for Amazon Lily. After returning to the island, Ran gave the newspaper to
Elder Nyon
. When the
Gorgon Sisters
were having their bath time, all Kujas left the castle. When a child asked why the sisters are left alone when they bathe, Ran revealed the story behind the Gorgon Sisters' supposed powers. Ran explained that Boa Hancock and her sisters were inflicted with a curse after slaying a gorgon. The three sisters supposedly have cursed eyes on their backs which turn anyone who sees them into stone and that was why no one was allowed into the castle during her their bath time.
Later,
Monkey D. Luffy
was captured for trespassing and was brought into the battle arena. Ran and the other Kujas then witnessed Luffy's strength as he felled
Bacura
with a single punch. She then watched Luffy's fight with
Boa Sandersonia
and
Boa Marigold
and witnessed Luffy unleashing his
Supreme King Haki
. After Luffy gained the upper hand, Sandersonia's back was nearly exposed, but Luffy covered it up. The Kujas immediately evacuate the arena. After the Trials of the Arena, she welcomed backed a newly de-petrified
Marguerite
and is surprised that Luffy was brought to Kuja Castle. After Luffy came in good terms with the empress, Ran laughed alongside her fellow
Kuja
and enjoyed the party with Luffy. After Luffy resolved to save
his brother
from execution, Ran and the Kuja bid farewell to Hancock and Luffy as they boarded Momonga's ship and promised to help take care of their county in their stead.
