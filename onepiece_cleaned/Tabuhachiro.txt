Tabuhachiro was among those arrested and thrown in
Rasetsu Town
for conspiring to defy Orochi.
In prison, he and the others received
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's final message of the rebels' new gathering place.
The group watched as the
Straw Hat Pirates
saved
Toko
and fought off Orochi's subordinates.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Tabuhachiro and the other rebels were freed from Rasetsu Town by
Denjiro
, adding 1,000 soldiers to the raid's forces. The group sailed to
Tokage Port
to retrieve the Scabbards and commence the raid.
After docking on
Onigashima
and sinking their ships, Tabuhachiro and the others disguised themselves as
Waiters
using
Kin'emon
's
Kin-chan Gofukuten
. Kin'emon instructed them to avoid unnecessary conflict, as the disguises will disappear if damaged, and the group cheered in anticipation of the invasion.
Tabuhachiro joined Kin'emon's Eastern forces, and the group approached a
brothel
. After
Sanji
failed to find any women, he continued to follow Kin'emon across the bridge while the Infiltration Team entered the
Skull Dome
through the building. The group heard
someone
from inside the brothel and all jumped in the water to hide, except
Chopper
and
Usopp
who were riding in the
Brachio Tank V
.
The group eventually infiltrated the party on the
Live Floor
and pretended to celebrate alongside the real
Beasts Pirates
.
After Luffy declared an all-out war, Tabuhachiro and his allies abandoned their disguises and stood ready to fight the enemy crew.
