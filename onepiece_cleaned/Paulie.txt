Paulie
is the current vice president of the
Galley-La Company
in
Water 7
.
Before being promoted, he was one of the five Dock One foremen, specializing in rigging, knots, and masts.
He became an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the end of the
Water 7 Arc
and the beginning of the
Enies Lobby Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Paulie is often seen with a cigar in his mouth. His denim jacket has a flame detail, many of his cigars strapped to it (in a similar fashion to
Smoker
), and a big "1" printed on its back, most likely referring to Dock 1 (though in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a black jacket emblazoned with roses and chains).
His hair is blond and slicked back on his head while wearing a pair of orange goggles on top. These goggles were cracked on the right side for the second half of the Water 7 arc and the duration of the Enies Lobby arc as a result of his fight with
Rob Lucci
and
Kaku
.
He is quite muscular, and his attire is completed by a yellow T-shirt, with white concentric circles in the middle of it, a belt around his waist with a little bag attached to it, and a pair of loose trousers tucked inside his boots. He's usually seen frowning.
In his appearance in the
Where They Are Now?
cover story, he was seen wearing an elegant, unbuttoned jacket over a cloud-patterned shirt, with a loose tie around the unbuttoned collar, and matching suit trousers. He still had his trademark goggles, belt and cigars strapped to his jacket, and a hammer and a small purse were attached to his belt.
Personality
[
]
Paulie calls Nami a "shameless girl".
Paulie is shown as closest to and most trusted by
Iceburg
.
He also shows a prudish outlook on the way many female characters dress. Unlike most other male characters such as
Sanji
, Paulie often becomes outraged at how much of their bodies women such as
Nami
(even calling her a harlot, much to her annoyance),
Kalifa
,
and
Mozu and Kiwi
(who call him an overly shy man)
show off when they are in the company of men.
He apparently enjoys gambling, as he has many debts to pay off and is often pursued by debt-collectors. When he is first introduced, he tries to steal two suitcases full of money from Luffy to pay off his gambling debts.
Though he is thwarted by
Lucci
and pulled back on land by his ear and gives back the suitcases, he asks for 10% of the cash if Luffy really wanted to thank him, shortly before being knocked over the head by Lucci with a hammer.
However, Paulie is still a kind-hearted man, and very caring about his friends and mentor.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of
Dock 1
's foremen, and later as the vice president of
Galley-La Company
, Paulie is an extraordinarily skilled shipwright, who actively took part in the realization of the
Thousand Sunny
for the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Aside from his shipwright skills, Paulie possesses formidable physical and fighting capabilities.
He has shown to be several times stronger than common humans: he effortlessly slammed many members of the Franky Family one onto another with just two ropes and the sheer strength of his arms, and he also pulled a giant to the ground with a similar method. He can throw ropes against his enemies in a straight line with enough blunt power to defeat them with one blow, and was able to open alone one of the two gigantic wings of Dock 1's door. Last but not least, he managed to slam Luffy around with his rope and actually hurt him, despite his
rubber body
.
He is highly resistant and resilient, as he took a full beating from
CP9
members and was able to stand back up in mere moments; the injuries he suffered apparently healed in a very short period of time. On Enies Lobby, he was pierced from side to side by a member of the
Watchdog Unit of the Law
and yet managed to fight without consequences for the rest of the story arc.
Paulie is also very acrobatic and agile, as he leaped off one of Water 7's high bridges and landed on a
Yagara Bull
without a scratch.
Rope Action
[
]
Further information:
Rope Action
"Rope Action: Figure of 8 Knot".
Paulie has a unique fighting style; he makes use of an intricate array of acrobatics combined with rigging techniques that employ a complicated use of ropes that appear from under his sleeves. It is also versatile since the ropes enable him to increase the reach of his attacks - be it long-ranged, mid-ranged, or even melee - and even attack multiple targets at once, giving Paulie an advantage in battle, be it group combat or one-on-one.
The amount of rope he carries is immense and measures hundreds, if not thousands of meters, as he was actually able to make a huge, complex rope-work in a split-second to keep not only himself, but also the entire Franky Family, their King Bulls, Oimo, and Kashii from falling into the huge pit in Enies Lobby.
The amount of rope that he uses as a weapon and brings with himself all the time never seems to run out, since he has been known to pull out yards upon yards from time to time.
When he attacks, the ropes generally snake their way out his sleeve and wrap around the target. He typically weaves his ropes into patterns that help him to either ensnare foes or restrain their movements, making them more vulnerable to incoming attack. Paulie can also use his ropes outside of battle, as seen when he successfully deceived the marines that he had already been captured when in reality, he deliberately tied himself up with his own ropes and was just waiting for the right time to release himself, the Franky Family, and the giants.
History

Past
[
]
A young Paulie at Puffing Tom's opening.
During the opening day of the
Puffing Tom
, a young Paulie was seen attending its coronation. He appeared enthusiastic about the new amazing means of transportation, even running after the train when it started its first journey. Inspired by this event, Paulie decided to become a shipwright.
He then grew up and joined the Galley-La Company, eventually becoming one of the company's top foremen.
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
Paulie first appeared while working in
Dock 1
. When
Mikazuki
refused to pay for his ship's repairs, Paulie and the other Galley-La workers attacked the pirates.
Later, Paulie was running away from debt collectors. To escape, he hijacked a
Yagara Bull
the
Franky Family
was using to steal the
Straw Hats
' money, thus helping them in the process.
However, he then tried to steal the money himself, but was stopped by
Rob Lucci
who then got into a brief, apparently "friendly" fight with him.
When Galley-La refused to repair
Going Merry
, Paulie explained that ships are built starting with the keel and that replacing the keel would mean building a new ship. When
a world government officer
appeared, Paulie told Nami and Luffy to hide and wondered what the World Government wanted with
Iceburg
. Paulie chastised Nami and Luffy's screaming after they discovered their suitcases were empty.
Peepley Lulu
pointed out that
Usopp
was kidnapped by the Franky Family, and Paulie told Nami where the Franky House's location, although Luffy had already run off.
Later, he was shocked to hear about the attempted murder on
Iceburg
. He angrily expelled the journalists from the
Galley-La Headquarters
courtyard
and then searched for the Straw Hats with the other foremen of Galley La to eliminate them, believing them to be responsible for the crime.
They managed to find
Luffy
, and Paulie showed his great mastery with ropes by smashing him around,
until
Franky
interrupted the battle with his
Coup de Vent
, and Luffy and
Nami
managed to escape.
When night fell, the whole Galley La company guarded the office thinking that the murderer might attack Iceburg again.
Iceburg asked him to go to his office to retrieve a fake blueprint of the
Pluton
.
As he was retrieving it, he was surprised by two
masked
strangers
who had no problem in dealing with him.
Right as he was about to be killed, Luffy crashed into the wall, proving to him that the attempted assassin were not the Straw Hat Crew, he was then trapped with Luffy and left to die.
Luffy, Zoro, and Paulie outrun a wave.
However, with the help of Luffy, he got free and ran to Iceburg's aid.
There, it was revealed to him that Lucci, Kaku,
Kalifa
, and
Blueno
were all working
undercover
for the
government
. Shocked at first, Paulie tried to avert this truth as some misunderstanding, until Lucci revealed that he could talk without
Hattori
's assistance, and that he would prove his antagonism by stepping on Iceburg's face, which angered Paulie, as he recognized the voice as one of the assailants who trapped them in the office. Paulie attempted to attack his former best friend, only to be brutalized by Lucci's mastery of
Rokushiki
.
Lucci then shocked Paulie and the others further by utilizing his
Devil Fruit
, the
Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard
, and transforming into a bipedal leopard to greatly enhance his strength. Paulie, shocked and horrified, tried to get Iceburg to safety, but was stopped by Lucci, who rebuffed Paulie's claim of thinking of them as friends. As the CP9 set the building on fire and left Paulie and Iceburg tied up to burn,
they were then saved by
Chopper
, who took the two out of the place safely.
Luffy, Paulie and Zambai team up.
He later helped Nami and Chopper search for Luffy and Zoro to go save
Nico Robin
. He rescued them as they were about to get washed away by a wave.
As the crew was determined to follow the train carrying Robin, he tried to stop them because of the phenomenon called
Aqua Laguna
, explaining its devastating effects on the city and the impossibility of navigating during it.
The Straw Hats, however, eager to save their crewmate, refused to listen to him. He eventually met up with Lulu and
Tilestone
, and they hid themselves on the
Rocketman
in order to help the Straw Hats to achieve their goal.
He was later seen on the Rocketman along with the other Galley La foremen, having joined forces with the Franky Family and Straw Hat Pirates;
they passed through the Aqua Laguna and proceeded to
Enies Lobby
.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Paulie is injured by a
Watchdog Unit of the Law
.
As they were reaching Enies Lobby, Paulie drew a map (he had been there before to repair the rails) and planned how they will go inside. As they were waiting for the time to land, Luffy had already flown into Enies Lobby and started rampaging there. When they attack the island, together with the Franky Family and his comrades, they defeated
Oimo
and
Kashii
. When they entered the gate, one from the
Watchdog Unit of the Law
leaped forward and stabbed Paulie. The Rocketman suddenly landed with the remaining Straw Hats.
Paulie and Zambai "defeat" Baskerville.
As they were riding the Franky Family's
King Bulls
, he told Zoro, "If you meet them (the four traitors), tell them that they are fired."
Sodom
was shot in the heart and collapsed. Together with Lulu and Tilestone, they fought the remaining Marines. Later as they were about to collapse, they saw Oimo and Kashii with Sogeking, not as enemies but as allies. When they reached the Courthouse with the Franky Family, they defeated
Baskerville
.
As the
Buster Call
was summoned, he tied himself up with his own ropes as the others were tied up by the Marines, waiting for an opportunity to escape.
Kashii and Oimo carried them to the front gates where battleships fired at them.
Paulie caught them with his rope, and they finally escaped.
They hijacked the Puffing Tom and returned to Water 7.
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
After the events of Enies Lobby, Paulie and the others all returned to Water 7, where he led the reconstruction of the Galley-La Company's main headquarters. Along with Iceburg, Peepley Lulu, and Tilestone, he joined Franky in building
a new ship
for the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
