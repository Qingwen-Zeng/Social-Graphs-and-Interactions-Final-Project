Mochi was first seen talking with his friends outside Conis's house about how evil she is for rebelling against God, and for helping the pirates of the East Blue. They then talk about their fathers, and how they work for God. Mochi says he can not wait to meet his father, despite never seeing his face, and his friends also say they want to meet him.
