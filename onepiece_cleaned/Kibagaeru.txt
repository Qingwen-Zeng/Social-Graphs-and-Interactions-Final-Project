Kibagaeru
was the
captain
of the
Fanged Toad Pirates
until he lost to
Foxy
at the
Davy Back Fight
and joined
his crew
but eventually left sometime during the
Timeskip
. Due to his
anime-exclusive
actions, he can be considered one of the main antagonists of the
Foxy's Return Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Kibagaeru as a member of the Foxy Pirates.
Kibagaeru is a wide-framed man with a gray mustache. He is dressed in elaborate pirate clothes, including a orange vest with a light purple tucked-in scarf, a blue captain's coat and a tricorne that had his crew's
Jolly Roger
on it. Upon joining the Foxy Pirates, he has crossed out the Jolly Roger on his hat, signifying his defection from his old crew, and donned an eye mask which the rest of the crew wears. He occasionally seems to be cross-eyed, which makes him resemble a frog.
Personality
[
]
As a pirate, Kibagaeru follows the code of honor quite strictly, as he adhered to the rules of the
Davy Back Fight
, and joined the opposing crew upon losing, even if it means abandoning his old crew, as well as losing his captaincy. He can be despicable and opportunistic, not caring much for the crew he left behind in favor of joining a bigger one, and in the anime, trying to usurp Foxy's position and kicking him out of the crew along with
Porche
and
Hamburg
, Foxy's first and most loyal crewmates.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Kibagaeru was the captain of the Fanged Toad Pirates, so he possessed authority over his subordinates. When he joined Foxy's crew following his defeat in the Davy Back Fight, he relinquished that authority upon becoming his subordinate.

History

Past
[
]
Kibagaeru, as the captain of the Fanged Toad Pirates, was challenged by Foxy and his crew to a Davy Back Fight. They had five matches, and Kibagaeru and his crew lost all five, thus resulting in Kibagaeru and the crew's essential members (
doctor
,
shipwright
, and
navigator
) and jolly roger being taken by Foxy, leaving what's left of the crew in a wreck.

Later, when the
Straw Hat Pirates
questioned about the challenge, Kibagaeru and his old colleagues happily revealed that they defected from their old crew and joined the new one willingly, showing the seriousness of the fight.
After the Davy Back Fight he and the rest of the crew sailed off as Foxy vows revenge on Luffy.

Foxy's Return Arc
[
]
After the Straw Hats'
encounter
with
Noko
, in
a short anime filler arc
, Kibagaeru took over the Foxy Pirates after Foxy lost the last event of the Davy Back Fight, and refused to allow Foxy back.
After a fight against him and the Straw Hat Pirates, he finally decided to let Foxy rejoin his crew.
Concludes non-canon section.
Sometime during the timeskip he left Foxy's crew for unknown reasons.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Kibagaeru was not named in the manga. He was first named in the ending credits of the anime, in a very vague manner, as "Kiba captain".
His official name was revealed in
One Piece Blue Deep: Characters World
.
Kiba
(
牙
,
Kiba
?
)
means "fang" in Japanese, while
gaeru
(
蛙
,
gaeru
?
)
means "frog". Put together, it would spell out "Fanged Toad", a direct translation to his former crew.
