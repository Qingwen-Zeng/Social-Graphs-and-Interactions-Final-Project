History
[

East Blue Saga
[
]
Loguetown Arc
[
]
While
Sanji
was walking around the marketplace, he stopped by a fish stall where he was welcomed by Sapi. Sapi then explained that the giant fish in front of them was a Blue-Finned Elephant Tuna after Sanji asked him what that weird fish was. Afterwards, he revealed to the customer that he had quickly snatched up the rare fish with his fishing pole since it normally could only be found in the
South Blue
. Seeing as how Sanji was highly captivated, Sapi then offered to cut up a slice for him. However, Sanji stated that he would buy the whole fish instead, to which Sapi gladly thanked him while wrapping up the fish.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, Sapi did not sell Sanji the Blue-Finned Elephant Tuna. Rather, Sanji was passing by his stall when he saw some unknown fish. Sapi then explained to him that the seas around
Loguetown
sometimes have fish from other seas, possibly due to the ocean currents, as they were near the
Grand Line
. Later, some other fishermen caught a Blue-Finned Elephant Tuna and, when Sanji offered to buy it, Sapi told the cook that the fish would serve as a prize for the Cooking Championship. Later, Sapi served as the announcer for the contest as well.
Also in the anime, Sapi's name was originally given as
Ness
(
ネス
,
Nesu
?
)
,
though his name was later changed in
One Piece Blue: Grand Data File
.
