"Demon Bamboo" Vergo
was one of the four elite
officers
and the first to occupy the Heart seat of the
Donquixote Pirates
under the codename
Corazon
.
He was a
Marine
vice admiral
, and head of
G-5
,
who made his debut at
Punk Hazard
.
Due to his duplicitous conduct and allegiances, he can be considered the secondary antagonist of the
Punk Hazard Arc
.
Appearance
Vergo was a tall, light-skinned, lean, yet muscular man with short dark hair, a beard, sideburns, and sunglasses. From his sideburns on, his facial hair grew horizontally. On his cheek it grew downwards with a pointed end.
Vergo wore a white knee-length trench coat that had a quilted design which stopped just below his waist (where the coat then had a plain design), along with two black pockets slightly above the chest on either side. Under the coat he wore a mauve-colored shirt with a purple-colored
ascot
embedded with a red jewel, with a golden-yellow outline at the top in the tie. He also wore black-colored gloves.
As Vergo was a messy eater, he tended to have pieces of food stuck to his face from time to time, such as French fries when residents of a certain island had a flashback of him, and a partially eaten hamburger patty stuck to his left cheek when he was first introduced.
However, once pointed out by
Monet
, Vergo then proceeded to finish eating the piece of food stuck to his cheek.
This also extends to eating utensils- a stirring spoon from a coffee cup got stuck to his face and it stayed on his face for a long time, as it was still stuck when he talked with Caesar following the spread of Shinokuni,
and when he proceeded to eliminate
G-5
.
After being interrupted by a kick from
Sanji
, however, the spoon was knocked loose from his face.
When he was younger, his relative features seem to be the same but is seen with a bowl haircut and lacking a full beard.
During his time as a vice admiral of
G-5
, Vergo wore a Marine coat over his current attire.

Personality
Through his short confrontation with
Trafalgar Law
, Vergo proved himself to be a shrewd man. He could also come across as patronizing, mocking Law's position by pretending to have some respect for the
Warlord
. Seeing himself as above the Warlord, Vergo quickly reminded Law of the difference in their power by beating him unconscious. He was also shown to be a person who demands respect from others, such as when he demanded that Law refer to him as Vergo-
san
.
While around citizens, Vergo was cited to be an amiable, personable and approachable person in comparison to the other G-5 Marines. The parents of the children kept on Punk Hazard trusted Vergo's words that all of the missing children died in accidents at sea. His statement caused them to partly believe that they were truly gone, though some parents still believed that their children are alive. Easily deceiving both citizens and the entire Marine bureaucracy, Vergo had proven himself to be highly manipulative and insidious.
His true identity being a secret to most, he could become very cruel and ruthless once he revealed his true disposition, and would murder his own Marine subordinates without so much as a moment of hesitation or explanation.
Being their leader also made him believe that anything he does to them is his right, believing they are nothing but rejects.
His cruelty was reflected in his fighting style, as he often brutally beat his victims into submission. He also offered to cut one of Law's ears off and send it to Doflamingo as proof that he killed him.
Contrary to his G-5 subordinates, he is very loyal to the Donquixote Family, respecting his comrades as family, though he showed extreme brutality when it comes to dealing with traitors, as he violently beat and scolded Rosinante for his treason; similarly, he does not hesitate in using similar violence against disrespectful juniors.
Despite his perceived intelligence, however, Vergo sometimes seemed to lapse into moments of witlessness such as when he claimed to Caesar that he had been enjoying coffee and cookies, only to be reminded shortly thereafter that there had never been any cookies to begin with.
Another example is when he was about to go after Smoker and Law, he could not remember where he placed his sword, only for Monet to remind him that he is not a swordsman.
Even Doflamingo is aware of this, as when Vergo claimed to have purchased a camera only to be reminded that he did not buy one at all.
In fact, he did not even notice there was a large piece of patty (or any other food and utensils) on his cheek until he was made to notice it.
This habit was even around when he was ten years old, as a large, partly-eaten loaf of french bread was stuck on his cheek.
Relationships
Marines
As a Marine officer, Vergo was supposed to be loyal to the ideals and duties of the naval military; he was shown to be have placed great efforts during his first year enlisted.
However, he was, in truth, a pirate who managed to keep his criminal activities a secret and was able to enlist into the Marines. Having spent 15 years ascending the ranks, he nevertheless was an enemy to the organization from the beginning, as he assisted Doflamingo in criminal activities by abusing the privileges as a high-ranking Marine officer, as well as passing off vital information and coverups.
G-5
As Vergo acted congenial towards everyone under his jurisdiction, his subordinates admired him despite their ruthless disregard for laws. However, when the situation called for it, Vergo was willing to mercilessly kill his Marine subordinates, which led them to adamantly believe that the Vergo attacking them was an impostor, insisting that the Vergo they knew was a kind and caring person. Smoker and Tashigi were the only two G-5 personnel who knew and accepted the truth.
While engaging Smoker in the SAD room, he revealed his contempt for his charges, dismissing them as failures to the Marines. He also believed that being their leader, he has the right to do anything he wants to them, even killing them outright.
Vergo was concerned about
Smoker
's transfer to G-5, as he mentioned that from the day Smoker was transferred, he had to put up the largest possible guard to prevent Smoker from finding him out.
Vergo also expressed the desire to murder Smoker
by accident
, since he knew his true disposition. Smoker in turn expressed disdain for his colleague's felonies and intended to battle him alone, in retribution for his treason against the Marines.
Crew and Allies
Donquixote Doflamingo
The Elite Officers bow before Doflamingo.
Vergo was stated to be
Donquixote Doflamingo
's most beneficial and trustworthy Marine officer. In the past, Vergo enlisted in the
Marines
under Doflamingo's orders.
Vergo called him "Doffy"
(
ドフィ
,
Dofī
?
)
but also referred to him as "Joker". Among the
Donquixote Pirates
, Vergo had been with Doflamingo the longest, along with the other elite officers, since the four of them already saw Doflamingo as their king when he was 10 years old. While many other citizens tortured Doflamingo for his former status as a Celestial Dragon, Vergo saw the young boy as a friend, and even accepted Doflamingo as his leader after seeing him awaken his Supreme King Haki.
Although Doflamingo was ultimately forced to leave Vergo to die when he lost to Law, he did so by thanking him for all his services, causing Vergo to smile silently.
Caesar Clown
Caesar Clown
seemed to trust Vergo, as demonstrated by him giving the Marine Law's heart, who was later able to use it to incapacitate Law when he had begun to move against them. However, Vergo and his group's distrust towards Caesar led them to hire Monet and place her in Caesar’s organization. Caesar, in turn, considered Vergo to be expendable, as he ordered the Shinokuni gas to be leaked into the room where Vergo was engaging his subordinates in order to exterminate the G-5 Marines as part of the demonstration, while revealing that Vergo's life was never a priority compared to the experiment.
Trebol, Diamante, and Pica
Vergo and the three had known each other for over thirty years. They shared a fierce loyalty with Doflamingo, to the point that the four of them destroyed an entire town for having bad pavement that made Doflamingo trip. They also referred to Doflamingo as "Doffy".
Like Vergo, they were Doflamingo's most trusted elite officers. However, upon Doflamingo's instructions to be enlisted into the Marines, his "secret mission" had been kept even from the members of the
Donquixote Pirates
, as stated by
Donquixote Rosinante
in his private conversation with
Law
.
Monet
Vergo and Monet were well-acquainted with one another, as they work under the same leader. Aside from Doflamingo, Monet was the only member of the
Donquixote Pirates
who knew about Vergo's mission to infiltrate the Marines.
Enemies
Donquixote Rosinante
Donquixote Rosinante
was Doflamingo's younger brother, who disappeared when he was 8 years old, and reappeared in front of the Donquixote Pirates at age 22 to join the crew. Because of Rosinante's claim, Doflamingo did not suspect him at all, and Vergo shared such trust.
Rosinante succeeded Vergo in the title "Corazon".
Upon discovering that Rosinante spied on the family on behalf of the Marines, Vergo immediately beat his successor violently, showing how angry he was at how their trust was infiltrated by a Marine.
Trafalgar Law
Vergo first met with
Trafalgar Law
13 years ago.
At the first moment of their encounter, Vergo acted congenially to the boy, not knowing who he was at the time. However, after finding out who he was via finding
Donquixote Rosinante
, Vergo showed his true nature. When Law tried to stop Vergo from brutalizing Rosinante, Vergo extended the beatings to the boy for not giving him the proper honorific suffix "
-san
".
The beating was so vicious that Doflamingo surmised that it traumatized Law to this day.
Vergo mocked Law by pretending to respect him as a Warlord, and then beating him unconscious without hesitation. Ever since that first meeting, Vergo demanded that Law show respect to him by adding the honorific suffix
-san
when addressing him, and on every occasion that Law neglected to do so, Vergo inflicted tremendous pain onto him. When Law did refer to him as that, it was to serve as mockery before he would defeat him in the SAD room.
On Doflamingo's orders, Vergo intended to kill Law in the most brutal manner possible, and Vergo even offered to cut off one of Law's ears as proof. Unfortunately for him, Law paid Vergo back in kind by cutting him in half upon his defeat. Despite this, Vergo tried to warn him about Doflamingo's past, which Law ignored. Law also did not hesitate in leaving Vergo to die in the SAD production room, which he knew would explode.
Sanji
Among the Straw Hats, Vergo only fought against Sanji. Even though Sanji attacked Vergo to stop him from killing Tashigi, he did despise Vergo for harming his Marine subordinates, stating that he was the kind of man that his captain would hate the most. However, their battle was left unfinished as Vergo left to pursue Law to the SAD room.
Abilities and Powers
Vergo was a powerful man who was confident in his superiority to an opponent like
Trafalgar Law
, who was strong enough to become a Warlord. This was proven by Vergo's two easy victories over Law, although the fact that he had Law's heart, which he used to weaken him, should be taken into consideration. Regardless, Doflamingo had enough confidence in Vergo's abilities to assign him to dispose of Law.
Vergo's mere presence was enough to scare off one of
Punk Hazard
's extremely fierce
dragons
. He completely overwhelmed Unit 01 of
G-5
, including
Tashigi
(minus Smoker at the time), despite their superior numbers.
Vergo defeated
Vice Admiral
Smoker
with moderate difficulty (while still holding back his full strength). It can be seen that Smoker already knew that he could not defeat Vergo, so he decided to concentrate on retrieving Law's heart.
Even when he was a 10-year-old, Vergo was strong enough to burn down an entire city alongside
Trebol
,
Diamante
and
Pica
, all of whom were children.
He also possessed considerable knowledgeable of Haki, particularly that those who possess
Supreme King Haki
have the qualities of a king.
As a former vice admiral and the former head of
G-5
, he had command over his lower ranking subordinates, as well as control over the entire base.
He was also skillful enough to deceive the entirety of the Marines, including the former fleet admiral,
Sengoku
, and the observant
Smoker
, in hiding his true affiliations, as well as deceiving citizens with pretexts by falsifying the crimes into "accidents at sea".
Even after abdicating the position of Corazon,
he remained an Elite Officer of the Donquixote Pirates until his death, meaning he had command over the two thousand soldiers and eleven officers of his pirate crew; his command was equal to Trebol, Diamante and Pica, and just underneath Doflamingo himself.
Physical Abilities
Vergo had an extremely high level of physical durability, endurance, and resilience; he shook off a
Diable Jambe
-enhanced kick from Sanji to the face (although the attack did cause him to spit out blood), which sent him through a metal wall, followed by an additional barrage of kicks, with few wounds.
Law's
Counter Shock
, an attack strong enough to knock a
giant
unconscious, barely fazed him. On
Minion Island
, Vergo stayed in a snowy environment without any signs of feeling cold, as he threw off his uniform and then had it draped over his shoulders open after violently beating Rosinante and Law.
He possessed immense physical strength, as he could fracture a bone in Sanji's leg with one kick. In the anime, he was shown defeating adults even at the age of 10. Vergo was also remarkably fast, as he could easily keep up with Sanji's agility and when Law used his
ROOM
to retrieve his heart, Vergo immediately appeared in front of him and sent him crashing into a railing with a kick.
Vergo was also an extremely skilled master of unarmed combat. He completely overpowered the expert
swordswoman
Tashigi and easily fought against Sanji, a powerful master of the
Black Leg Style
, matching him blow for blow.
Rokushiki
Further information:
Rokushiki
Like several other high-ranking Marines, Vergo had access to the Rokushiki martial arts style. Using
Shigan
, he swiftly stabbed multiple G-5 Marines at Punk Hazard.
He also used
Geppo
to escape from
H2S
gas and travel through a hallway,
and
Soru
to stop Trafalgar Law from retrieving his heart.
Vergo's mastery of
Tekkai
was at an extremely advanced level, causing Sanji to wonder if he was made of metal, as he easily withstood Sanji's Diable Jambe-enhanced kicks, which were powerful enough to burn through Jabra's Tekkai prior to Sanji's two years of training, and had become strong enough to destroy the stronger-than-steel body of a
Pacifista
.
Haki
Further information:
Haki
It was stated by Doctor
Fishbonen
that all vice admirals possess
Haki
,
so as a vice admiral, Vergo could also use the ability. Even as a cadet in the Marines, he was an exceptionally skilled Haki user.
Armament Haki
Vergo was an extremely skilled user of
Armament Haki
, having mastered hardening and imbuement, hardening himself and his bamboo stick, attacking opponents with great offensive power.
If applied onto his limbs, he could brutalize Law with his hardened fist(s) and elbow(s)
, and blocking
Tashigi
's
Meito
,
Shigure
with a hardened arm. Vergo has attested that his Armament Haki was far superior to
Smoker
's, as proven when he broke his hardened
Nanashaku Jitte
using his bamboo stick, severely wounding Smoker at the same time.
Caesar Clown
and
Donquixote Doflamingo
have both vouched that his mastery of Armament Haki was not something that an average opponent could handle.
He, in particular, is noted as being skilled enough to harden his entire body with it even 13 years prior, drastically improving his offensive and defensive capabilities, having dealt severe blows to
Rosinante
and
Law
.
According to Doflamingo, it protected Vergo from even Law's
spatial cutting power
, which is supposedly able to cut through anything. However, the Warlord did not count on the fact that the Supernova has improved his power dramatically since the last time the two fought and over the two-year timeskip.

Observation Haki
Vergo possessed the ability to use
Observation Haki
.
Weapons
During his time as a cadet, he carried a rifle on his back.
Vergo's main weapon was a long bamboo stick, which was most likely the source of his epithet, "Demon Bamboo", and he frequently used it in tandem with his Armament Haki.
It also doubled as a blowgun, which could shoot bamboo arrows (in the anime, bullets) that created large explosions.
When Vergo used this attack, the stick became enlarged but it did not break. In the anime, this technique was depicted with the bamboo making a horn-like sound.
Techniques
Oni Take
(
鬼・竹
,
Oni Take
?
, literally meaning "Demon Bamboo")
: The source of his nickname, Vergo imbues his bamboo stick with Armament Haki, hardening it, and then strikes down his foe. It was first used to snap
Smoker
's Armament Haki-imbued
Nanashaku Jitte
in half while defeating the vice admiral at the same time. This attack was powerful enough to create a shockwave that dented several layers of steel in front of him.
In the English versions, this is called
Demon Bamboo
.
History
Past
The four children ruthlessly burning down an entire town for their poor pavement making their leader trip.
Vergo already came to know the
Donquixote Family
when he was 10 years old, having befriended
Donquixote Doflamingo
alongside the other future officers:
Trebol
,
Pica
, and
Diamante
while on the island of
Downs
in the
North Blue
. Impressed by Doflamingo's ability to use
Supreme King Haki
, Vergo, Trebol, Pica, and Diamante swore their loyalty to the young former Celestial Dragon and treated him like royalty, protecting and training him in the arts needed to make him the Pirate King.
Their devotion for him is such that they would kill any and everyone who would so much as offend Doflamingo in even the slightest manner, going as far as burning down an entire town for having poor pavement that made Doflamingo trip.
Vergo was the first person to hold the Heart seat (and in effect, the codename "Corazon") in the
Donquixote Pirates
.
At age 26, he enlisted in the
Marines
under Doflamingo's orders and abdicated the Heart Seat for
Donquixote Rosinante
to succeed him. Vergo then climbed the ranks for about fifteen years.
One year after becoming a Marine, he asked
Admiral
Sengoku
to transfer him to G-5.
Vergo attacks Rosinante.
About six months after his transfer, he was sent to
Swallow Island
to help retrieve the
Ope Ope no Mi
. There, he met a young boy named
Trafalgar Law
who had a message for the Marines. Law then asked Vergo to help save his injured friend, but upon reaching him, Vergo found out his friend was Rosinante. Vergo then read the letter and saw it consisted of information on the Donquixote Pirates' upcoming plans. Realizing that Rosinante was a spy for the Marines and that Law was the boy he had taken from the crew, Vergo immediately disposed of the document and violently beat both Rosinante and Law by hardening his fists with
Armament Haki
. Vergo then called Doflamingo to report Rosinante's treason, though Rosinante and Law managed to get away in secret while he was distracted.
Doflamingo would suggest that this event traumatized Law to this day.
He reached the rank of
captain
by the time Doflamingo took over
Dressrosa
, this was where the people of Dressrosa called the marines to ask for help of the situation, where Vergo responded by "accepting" their request.
He did this while keeping his true identity hidden from everyone outside of his affiliates. In the years that followed, Vergo continued to rise through the ranks of the Marines, and eventually became a
vice admiral
. This allowed Joker to have in his control one of the most trusted and convenient Marines available to him.
One day, he claimed to visit his sick sister in his hometown in order to take leaves of absence from his Marine duties.
After becoming head of G-5, Vergo also supported Caesar's research by reporting the kidnapped children to have died in accidents at sea in the official Marine reports, as well as helping to shroud the true nature of Punk Hazard in mystery,
though out of distrust,
Monet
was placed as a deep cover agent to monitor the deranged scientist on behalf of Joker.
During the Timeskip
When
Smoker
and
Tashigi
were assigned to G-5, Vergo told them that they would grow accustomed to the rowdy soldiers there and may even start caring for them. One time Tashigi went to tell him about a report of children being kidnapped, and Vergo lied that it was false and just a way to give the parents hope.
Thirteen years after Trafalgar Law had defected from the Donquixote Pirates, Monet reported that he was working with Caesar on Punk Hazard as one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
. Vergo was on Dressrosa at the time, and so boarded a
SAD
Tanker to Punk Hazard.
Dressrosa Saga
Punk Hazard Arc
Vergo brutally beats Law to the ground.
As Law and Monet were walking through
Caesar's lab
, Vergo approached them from the shadows and stopped Law in his tracks by squeezing his disembodied heart, which Law had given to Caesar as part of their agreement. Vergo said that Law had grown a lot since he had last seen him.
Vergo revealed Monet's undercover status, and when Law moved to attack him, Vergo responded by squeezing his heart and hitting him with his Haki-imbued staff.
Vergo and Monet then had Law imprisoned in a cage along with Smoker, Tashigi,
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Nico Robin
, and
Franky
who had all been captured by Caesar. Vergo looked outside with interest as he watched Caesar's new creation
Smiley
rampaging. He then revealed his true allegiance to Smoker and Tashigi, and stated that they and their soldiers would be killed here and he would pass off their deaths as an accident.
Vergo with Law's heart.
Caesar then entered the room, and Vergo and Monet watched as he unveiled his new weapon of mass destruction by transforming Smiley into a gas known as
Shinokuni
.
Caesar had the prisoners' cage moved outside to have them killed by Shinokuni, but after a while the trio did not see any pirates or Marines petrified by the gas after it had consumed the whole island. One of Caesar's men then reported that the prisoners had escaped their cage and broken into the lab, and Vergo went to go deal with Law and Smoker to ensure that he and Doflamingo would stay out of trouble.
Sanji attacking Vergo with Diable Jambe.
Vergo went to the passageway between Sections A and B and confronted a platoon of the G-5 Marines led by Tashigi. The Marines initially thought Vergo had come to help them, and were shocked when Vergo used
Shigan
on one of them. Tashigi attempted to tell the Marines about Vergo's true allegiance as she attacked him, but Vergo quickly overpowered her. The Marines then started attacking Vergo, though they were still in denial and believed him to be an impostor, and Vergo easily took them out. Suddenly,
Sanji
came rushing in and kicked Vergo in the face with
Diable Jambe
.
Sanji pummeled Vergo with more kicks, but Vergo quickly got back up with only minor injuries. He and Sanji then started clashing kicks as Shinokuni was released from Section A into the passageway. Suddenly, it was announced over the intercom that Law had gotten into the SAD Production Room, and Vergo was shocked upon realizing what Law was planning to do.
Vergo vs. Smoker
Vergo abandoned Sanji and used
Geppo
to escape into the Section B. He contacted Doflamingo to inform him of the situation, and Doflamingo ordered him to kill Law immediately.
When Vergo arrived at the SAD Production Room, Law attempted to use his
Ope Ope no Mi
powers to get his heart back, but Vergo physically overwhelmed him and was unfazed when Law tried to electrocute him with
Counter Shock
. Vergo then gave Law's heart a prolonged squeeze and made him lose consciousness before being confronted by Smoker.
Vergo revealed that he had already revealed his true colors to the rest of the G-5 platoon, and mocked Smoker for caring about insignificant soldiers. The two of them fought fiercely, and each managed to land blows on each other.
Law bifurcating Vergo.
Ultimately, Vergo was able to exploit Smoker's increased body volume that resulted from his
Logia transformation
and use Armament Haki to land a powerful strike on him, which broke his jitte and left him defeated on the ground. However, Law then approached the duo with his heart back in his possession, having managed to take it back with Smoker's help. Law started talking to Doflamingo, who was still listening through Vergo's
Den Den Mushi
, telling him that he was going to lose both Caesar and his SAD supply. Vergo covered his entire body in Armament Haki as he prepared to attack Law, but Law then took out
his sword
and used his Devil Fruit ability to unleash a massive cut which not only bisected Vergo at the waist, but split apart the entire laboratory and mountain.
Law then cut Vergo into several smaller pieces and attached them to the guardrail in front of the destroyed SAD production machines. Vergo warned Law that he would not be able to replace Doflamingo easily as he did not know Doflamingo's past, and Law responded by vertically bisecting his head.
Later, Doflamingo contacted Vergo to inform him that he had instructed Monet to activate a secret destructive gas, which would kill everyone around the lab except Caesar. He apologized to Vergo for having to do this and thanked him for all the work he had done, and Vergo simply smiled. The SAD Production Room then exploded,
and Doflamingo, upon arriving at Punk Hazard later, stated that Vergo had died.
