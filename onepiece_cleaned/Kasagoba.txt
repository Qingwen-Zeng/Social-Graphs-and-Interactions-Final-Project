Sea Beasts
to intercept the

. They gave the crew two choices: join the
New Fish-Man Pirates
or be crushed before being able to enter the island.
After
Monkey D. Luffy
rejected the invitation, the Straw Hats used the
their ship
's Coup de Burst to launch themselves into the island. Kasagoba was surprised by the ship's unexpected maneuver. After wondering what to do next, they returned to the
Fish-Man District
to report to their captain,
Hody Jones
.
Kasagoba is defeated by Luffy.
Kasagoba, alongside Hammond and Hyouzou, later went to
Mermaid Cove
in another attempt to capture Luffy, but they were easily repelled.
The attack knocked out Hammond and Kasagoba, but Hyouzou was able to block it and remained uninjured. After the Straw Hats left the cove, Hyouzou carried his two unconscious companions away.
