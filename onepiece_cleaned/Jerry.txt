Jerry
is a
Cipher Pol
agent of
CP6
. He was found as head of security of the
Puffing Tom
's seventh passenger car, which
Sanji
invaded to rescue
Nico Robin
. He comes from
Karate Island
in the
South Blue
, and claims to be a boxing champion.
He was one of the antagonists during the Sea Train voyage in the
Water 7 Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Jerry is an extremely tall man, so much so that he covers nearly the whole ceiling of the train car he was in with his upper body. His head is roughly twice as big as Sanji's. His legs are extremely long that their exact length is practically the height of the car he was in. His hair and beard are white while his mustache is black. Like other World Government agents, Jerry wears a suit, and he has a yellow pin of the World Government symbol on the right side of his chest. He personally wears red gloves that he uses for boxing.
Personality
[
]
As a Cipher Pol agent, he is staunchly loyal to the
World Government
. While fighting Sanji, he was shown to be foolishly boastful of his fighting capabilities against him; which he belays his men from informing CP9 of his intrusion.
Despite his pride in his Boxing skills, he is also devious and not above breaking its basic rules such as using kicks and feign attacks to gain an edge in battle.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Jerry is a self-proclaimed boxing champion from
Karate Island
in
South Blue
. While Jerry has excellent boxing skills, he has a great disadvantage if he is in a situation where his movements are greatly hindered, due to his height. To compensate in such a situation, Jerry learned Yoga so he could fight in small areas by positioning his legs behind his head. However while in his Yoga position, his normally long reach is hindered due to his legs getting in the way. Overall, from what has been shown, Jerry's strength is above that of normal soldiers, but far below Sanji's.
Attack List
[

Jerry Aurora Flicker Jab
(
ジェリー オーロラ フリッカー ジャブ
,
Jerī Ōrora Furikkā Jabbu
?
)
: Supposedly Jerry's most devastating boxing attack. He sends a flurry of rapid punches that are so fast that it seems as if he has several arms punching, similar to
Luffy
's
Gomu Gomu no Gatling
. It also covers a wide range which was shown with Jerry taking out his entire platoon of agents instead of Sanji.

Yoga One Two
(
ヨガ1･2
,
Yoga Wan Tsū
?
)
: While bending his legs behind his back to shorten himself, Jerry launches two simple boxing punches that are unfortunately hindered by his own reach. It is also a feign move to get his opponent to drop their guard.
Screw Drop Kick
(
スクリュー ドロップ キック
,
Sukuryū Doroppu Kikku
?
)
: Jerry delivers a spinning kick towards an opponent. This attack, however, completely ignores the basic rules of boxing.
History
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
Jerry is defeated by Sanji.
When Sanji was discovered by the agents in the sea train, Jerry introduced himself to Sanji, while in the midst of the cook's smoke, and told the other agents that it was unnecessary to alert
CP9
of the intruder. Slightly provoked by Sanji, Jerry then attacked Sanji with a flurry of punches. Unfortunately the small space of the car he was in did not give him much room to attack properly and instead of attacking Sanji, he attacked the other agents accidentally. Trying to make up for this, Jerry folded his body over in what he claimed was his yoga style, only to find that he no longer had a long enough reach to hit Sanji. So, he simply charged at Sanji with a jumping kick move, only to be taken down in one hit.
Jerry and the other agents were later discovered unconscious by a Marine on board. They were given first aid per Captain
T Bone
's orders.
It is unknown what happened to Jerry after the incident in the Puffing Tom. He is most likely together with the
Marines
and Cipher Pol agents that rowed the remains of the sixth and seventh cars after
Zoro
cut them in half, along with T Bone.
