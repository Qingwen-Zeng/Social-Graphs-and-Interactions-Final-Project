Personality
[
]
Daifugo brutally punishes Hyougoro for violating rules.
Daifugo takes his responsibilities as vice warden seriously, and is cruel and violent toward prisoners who are breaking the rules, wanting order in the prison to be maintained and having no leniency toward rule-breakers, as seen when he brutally attacked
Hyougoro
to stop him from eating kibi dango he had not earned.
He is also arrogant, as he proudly proclaimed that he would defeat Luffy in no time if he were given the chance.
After he was
tamed
by
Kurozumi Tama
, he became loyal and supportive to her, aiding her in turning the other Gifters into allies of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
.
He loves scorpions, and has since before he ate his SMILE fruit.

As a vice warden of the Prisoner Mines, Daifugo has a great amount of authority over the prisoners in it,
and as a Shinuchi, he holds a high
position
in the
Beasts Pirates

Seastone
handcuffs.

Wano Country Saga
[

Wano Country Arc
[
]
Daifugo beat up the prisoner
Hyo
after correctly assuming that he had not legitimately earned all the meal tickets he had. Daifugo grabbed Hyo and told him to reveal who had given him the meal tickets, but Hyo responded with defiance.
Monkey D. Luffy
then came and kicked Daifugo,
injuring part of his head and knocking him to the ground. The warden
Babanuki
then subdued Luffy, and he and Daifugo consulted with
Queen
about the issues the
Prisoner Mine
was facing.
As Luffy continuously defeated his opponents in the Sumo Inferno, Daifugo commented that the execution would have ended sooner if he had been fighting in the ring.
On the next day,
Big Mom
arrived at
Udon
prison. After Big Mom overpowered Queen, Daifugo asked Babanuki if they should attack her, but Babanuki advised against it. He was surprised when he saw Luffy had removed his and Hyougoro's collars.
The prisoners turn against Daifugo.
After Queen left with a captured Big Mom, Babanuki ordered the prisoners to help subdue Luffy. As Luffy was held back, Daifugo shot a prisoner with an
Excite Bullet
, causing his body to burn all over. The vice warden revealed that the bullets contained the
Mummy virus
which can be spread by making contact with the skin of someone who was shot by one. Daifugo then aimed at Luffy, saying he could subdue the pirate by shooting any of the prisoners grabbing him. Before he took a shot, he was interrupted by
Kawamatsu
's shouting.
As Luffy and his allies from the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
fought against the
Beasts Pirates
, Daifugo proceeded to infect more prisoners with the virus. He was surprised when Luffy allowed himself to be infected. After Luffy rallied the prisoners to rebel, Daifugo desperately tried to threaten the prisoners with plague shots only to be pummeled by the inmates.
Sometime after the prison uprising,
Kurozumi Tama
tamed
Daifugo, turning him into her ally. During the
Fire Festival
, Daifugo,
Speed
, and
Gazelleman
went to
Onigashima
with Tama on Speed's ship. After arriving, the three distributed Tama's dangos to the other Gifters.
Once Tama issued the command for the Gifters to fight against
Kaidou
, Daifugo fought off other Beasts Pirates that wanted to kill her.
Later, the group fled the flames spreading through the castle, with Daifugo helping
Hamlet
carry the unconscious
Komachiyo
. As they descended the stairs, the group came across
Kin'emon
's legs running around, so Usopp and Hamlet split off to find and help
Kikunojo
and the rest of Kin'emon,
while the others continued on and took shelter in the bathhouse on the Forehead Floor, where they met up with
Marco
.
