Water 7 Arc
[
]
Mikazuki is defeated by the Galley-La workers.
Mikazuki first appeared at Galley-La Dock 1 when the
company
had finished their work on his ship. Although he said that he was grateful that they had repaired his ship, he claimed that the repairs were overpriced, and as such, refused to pay the fees. He then threatened
Paulie
with his sword and thanked him for the free repairs. Paulie then warned him that he should be careful of who he was threatening, and the shipwrights swiftly knocked Mikazuki and his crew out.

Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Although he had been defeated by Galley-La, Mikazuki was not handed over to the authorities to collect the bounty for the repair fees. Instead, he was forced to work under local loansharks to earn enough money to pay for the repairs. As such, when the loansharks encountered
Zoro
during their first attempt to collect money from the orphanage's
Aunt
, they employed Mikazuki as an enforcer in case they encountered him again.
During the loansharks' second attempt, Mikazuki was ordered to threaten Aunt and make her pay. He and Aunt engaged in a battle, but were then interrupted by Zoro. Seeing the swordsman, Mikazuki attempted to attack him, but was easily blown away by Zoro's
Nanajuni Pound Ho
.
