Ginko was the first person at Punk Hazard whom Momonosuke opened up to and conversed with.

However, they were not seen interacting with each other since Momonosuke first transformed into a dragon, even after they were all freed from Punk Hazard.

Past
[

At some point, Ginko was taken from her parents after being told she was sick and would be made healthy again. She was taken to Punk Hazard, and on her way, she met Momonosuke. He was quite standoffish and did not accept food from anyone else even Ginko.
When Momonosuke went to the "secret room" where the prototype
Artificial Devil Fruit
was, she followed him and walked in after he ate it. They talked and he told her his past, something that he had not told anyone since he was kidnapped. She told him that everyone else felt the same way about leaving, but he should try to have fun and forget it for now.
Then, a number of Punk Hazard officials showed up. Ginko started to run and told Momonosuke to come with her, when all of a sudden he stopped and started acting strange. Ginko and the Punk Hazard officials watched in horror as Momonosuke transformed into a dragon and fled.
