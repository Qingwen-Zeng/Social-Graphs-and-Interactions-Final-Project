.

is one of the
Senior Officers
, and the
cook
of the
Red Hair Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Lucky Roux has a round body shape, and he is always seen eating a rack of
meat
. He is shown wearing goggles over his eyes at all times. Out of the entire crew, he appears to have changed the least over the years and shows little in the way of aging. In every appearance, Roux is smiling happily no matter how serious the situation is, such as
Shanks
clashing with
Whitebeard
.
He wears a green t-shirt with white vertical stripes on it, paired by a matching bandanna on his head, short white pants (beige in the anime) with a dark green sash around his waist, and green shoes with fur around the ankles. He has a yellow coat draped over his shoulders like a cape, with a fur-lined collar and red epaulets with black stripes on them.
Personality
[
]
Roux appears to be a very fun-loving pirate who is often seen hanging around another one of Shanks' crew members,
Yasopp
. He seems to be one of Shanks's most trusted crew members, as he is always seen when the Red Hair Pirates are featured, usually when something crucial happens. He shares this trait with
Benn Beckman
and Yasopp. He is the first person to actually kill someone in One Piece and sets the stage for the series: A pirate's life is a dangerous one.
He has a very large appetite, and, in the manga, he is seen drinking a whole barrel of
sake
by himself in the background while the crew was at the bar
Makino
worked in.
He is almost always shown with a large grin even during the war, holding a large rack of meat in at least one hand, except for one scene in
Episode 316
, where he is holding onto a rail without any sign of meat.
He is not very good with women.

(
