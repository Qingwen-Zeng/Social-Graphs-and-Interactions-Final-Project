The
Fude Fude no Mi
is a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows the user to generate ink from their body and use a painting brush to turn images created with that ink into three-dimensional, lifelike objects. It was eaten by
Kurozumi Kanjuro
,
but with his death, it has returned to circulation.
Etymology
[
]
Fude
(
筆
?
)
is Japanese for "
ink brush
".
Appearance
[
]
The fruit is shaped like the lower part of a gourd, having a very narrow top before widening out significantly. It notably possesses two colors, with its top half being dark-colored and the bottom being light-colored (the exact colors are currently unknown as the anime scene where the fruit was shown was in black and white). While the bottom half possesses normal Devil Fruit spirals, the top half possesses a more unusual fishhook-shaped pattern set. The fruit has a horizontal-shaped stem which curves in an upward spiral on the left side and a downward spiral on the right.
Strengths
[
]
Kanjuro generating ink.
Due to the user being capable of generating ink from their body, they can create drawings at any time they wish without needing an external source of ink. The user can channel their ink through brushes to paint; although if they lack a brush, their hair has been shown to also suffice.
The user can change the color of the ink they generate at will for aesthetic purposes.
Once the user has drawn an object, they are capable of transforming the drawing into a three-dimensional object which possesses the same properties as the real-life subject it is based on, or a different property if the user so wishes, such as drawings of humans and
animals
gaining a consciousness, drawings of weapons having the same effect as their real-life counterparts, and drawings of
food
being edible and sustaining (albeit with a bad taste), among other things.
The user thus becomes capable of creating an unfathomably wide range of objects to support them in just about any situation. The user is also capable of reversing the typical process of the power by transforming their own body into a two-dimensional drawing, which has been shown to aid them in hiding.
The user is able to fully control the living creatures they draw and can speak through them, allowing them to create fighters to aid them in combat or attack on a different front. It appears that the user shares the senses of the creatures they create, allowing them to know what is happening around a drawing if it is separated from them. Provided the user sufficiently knows the appearance of a person, they can create perfect replicas of people, including themselves, to fool enemies; the replicas will even possess the same voice as the person they are emulating.
The user can also shroud themselves inside a drawing of another person, allowing them to go around under the guise of someone else.
While the accuracy is unknown,
Orochi
believes that the user can transfer their consciousness into a drawing when their real body dies.
Drawings do not bleed nor possess internal organs, so deceptive clones can best be exposed by cutting them. However, this makes it harder to fully take down a replica, as they do not feel pain and can remain alive and moving even when severely disfigured, with some of Kanjuro's living drawings being active even while missing heads.
Ultimately, though, it appears that a living drawing will dissolve once it takes a sufficient amount of damage, as shown when Kanjuro's
Kouzuki Oden
drawing disappeared after blowing up
dynamite
on its body.
Finally, drawings will instantly dissolve whenever the user wishes.
Weaknesses
[
]
The strength and abilities of the users' drawings heavily depend on the artistic skill of the user. Poorly-drawn constructs of living creatures have been shown in a constant state of struggle and exhaustion throughout their existence, and their movement capabilities are extremely limited. The poorly-drawn birds that Kanjuro created in
Dressrosa
struggled to fly and carry people, whereas the perfectly-drawn crane he created in
Wano
was not shown laboring at all.
If a drawing becomes too exhausted, it will revert back to its nonliving, two-dimensional state.
Kanjuro's snakes withstand the rain.
The drawings have shown a certain degree of weakness to water. On
Zou
, a large stream of water dissolved a cat that Kanjuro had drawn, but in Wano, Kanjuro's drawings were not shown to be affected by a heavy downpour of rain. Given that the cat in the former instance was poorly drawn, the drawing quality may impact the drawing's susceptibility to water, or another possibility is that drawings in general are capable of surviving rain showers but not standing water and large deluges.
Manually controlling a drawing remotely takes a toll on the user's energy. If the user is injured or otherwise weakened, they may struggle to use this power.
Otherwise, the user is affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.
Usage
[
]
Kanjuro using his full potential to animate an elegant crane.
Kanjuro frequently creates his drawings using a
giant paintbrush
which serves as his main weapon. When operating with the
Kouzuki Family
, Kanjuro pretended that he was very bad at drawing, producing only poorly-drawn, barely functional constructs.
However, he was actually an extremely skilled artist, able to draw life-like creatures including human beings. Despite having spent years acting like a mediocre artist, his true skills did not deteriorate, as he was able to produce perfect drawings once he ceased his act. When the
Nine Red Scabbards
sailed out to
Onigashima
to confront
Kaidou
, Kanjuro sent a perfectly drawn clone of himself with them, with none of them noticing until
Kin'emon
decapitated the drawing. The speed and precision of Kanjuro's artistry are also impressive, as he was able to draw a large crane in an instant. His created animals are as capable as real ones, if not more, such as snakes with powerful constricting strength or elegantly flying cranes. Furthermore, Kanjuro hid his powers' more potent usages from the Kouzuki Family, such as generating ink from his hair to create a rain of hardened ink droplets.
Kanjuro can also combine his acting skills with his paintings to create psychological attacks, as he did so by animating a painting of Kouzuki Oden and using his knowledge of the daimyo's personality to create a persuasive illusion of him. This deception managed to catch the Nine Red Scabbards off guard, and when the truth was discovered, they were psychologically wounded.
Techniques
[
]
Kanjuro bringing a drawing of a dragon to life.
Ideyo
(
出でよ
,
Ideyo
?
, literally meaning "Appear")
: The most basic technique of this fruit, in which Kanjuro transforms his two-dimensional drawing into a three-dimensional lifelike object. The drawing steadily peels off the surface it is on from the front to the back as it transforms.
Nuke Suzume
(
抜け雀
,
Nuke Suzume
?
, literally meaning "Escaping Sparrow")
: Kanjuro poorly draws a large sparrow in order to escape a confined area. However, due to being poorly drawn, the sparrow cannot fly very well. He first used it to escape Dressrosa's prison with Kin'emon.
In the
VIZ manga
and
Funimation
adaptations, this is called
Spring Sparrow
.
Nobori Ryu
(
昇り竜
,
Nobori Ryū
?
, literally meaning "Rising Dragon")
: Kanjuro poorly draws a long dragon which cannot fly, but can climb up cliffs and steep surfaces. He first used it to take him and the Straw Hat Pirates and allies up one of Zou's legs. However, his creation disgusted Kin'emon, as he hates the sight of dragons, while
Robin
, in contrast, actually blushed because she found it very cute.
In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Rising Dragon
.
Kanjuro uses Ukiyo Yudachi Ezu.
Sumigumo
(
墨雲
,
Sumigumo
?
, literally meaning "Ink Clouds")
: By pulling on his strands of hair, Kanjuro shoots out a thick cloud of ink from his mane, in a way reminiscent of an octopus.
In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Ink Clouds
.
Ukiyo Yudachi Ezu
(
浮世夕立ち絵図
,
Ukiyo Yūdachi Ezu
?
, literally meaning "Fleeting World Evening Shower Painting")
: Once the cloud is positioned above the intended target, Kanjuro releases a shower of dozens of ink drops from it, which he calls "Ink Arrows"
(
墨の矢
,
Sumi no Ya
?
)
. These drops are sharp enough to easily pierce through wood and flesh alike. Kanjuro first used this technique on the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's fleet in order to escape unimpeded.
Ukiyo-e
is a Japanese genre of art that was popular from the 17th through 19th centuries. The name of the technique is also linked with Kanjuro's epithet of "Evening Shower". In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Ukiyo Portrait: Evening Shower
.
Named Creations
[
]
Ryunosuke
Nekozaemon
Torasaburo
Kazenbo
Ryunosuke
(
りゅーのすけ
,
Ryūnosuke
?
)
: The poorly-drawn dragon created with the
Nobori Ryu
technique for the purpose of climbing up to Zou. Was given its name by the
Straw Hat Pirates
. It successfully completed the climb despite its poor bodily composition, but faded away from exhaustion immediately afterward.
Nekozaemon
(
ねこざえもん
,
Nekozaemon
?
)
: A giant, poorly-drawn cat with disproportionately short and small limbs. By Kanjuro's claim, cats are good climbers, which was the purpose of drawing Nekozaemon, but due to it being poorly drawn with short limbs, the cat climbed at a very slow rate, seemingly exhausted after a short amount of time. He drew it to climb back up one of Zunesha's legs after falling off Ryunosuke; however, it was washed away by Zunesha's eruption rain.
Torasaburo
(
虎三郎
,
Torasaburō
?
)
: A poorly-drawn tiger that is fairly rotund and has a short tail and crudely drawn stripes. Kanjuro drew it to climb back up one of Zunesha's legs for the second time after Nekozaemon failed.
Saburo
means "third son," referencing how it was the third drawing to climb up Zunesha.
Kazenbo
(
火前坊
,
Kazenbō
?
, literally meaning "Monk Before the Fire")
: A ghost-like entity wreathed in flames. The creature is several times larger than regular humans and takes the shape of a blob with two glowing eyes. It is capable of passing through walls and sets everything it touches on fire. Kanjuro created it as his final performance to symbolize the "burning hatred" of the Kurozumi Family.
History
[
]
This fruit came into the possession of
Kurozumi Orochi
,
Kurozumi Higurashi
, and
Kurozumi Semimaru
over 41 years ago. When their relative Kanjuro came to them, Orochi gave him the fruit to aid in his task of infiltrating the
Kouzuki Family
.
With his final usage of the power by creating Kazenbo, Kanjuro died from his fatal injuries, and the Fude Fude no Mi returned to circulation.
