Appearance
[
]
Stuck in his Zoan form, Minozebra is a large bipedal zebra with a human abdomen, in pants. He has a runny nose and large lips like every other Jailer Beast. Also he has long elegant hair. Unlike the other Jailer Beasts, Minozebra has bored looking eyes instead of cutesy ones. He wields a long spiked ball mace.
Personality
[
]
Minozebra is described as very shy, although he is a brutal beast who regularly tortures the prisoners of Impel Down.
He acknowledges Sadi's superiority in battle, even fearing her when she got angry over his failure.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of the Jailer Beasts of Impel Down under
Sadi
, Minozebra is in charge of torturing and maintaining various prisoners.
Weapons
[
]
He fights with a mace with spikes all around the iron ball at the end of the rod.
Devil Fruit
[
]
He has eaten an as-of-yet unnamed
Zoan
type Devil Fruit that allows him to become a zebra. Because he is an "
Awakened Zoan
", he is able to recover rapidly even after suffering high amounts of damage.
However, his Awakening is also a failure, and he has succumbed fully into an animalistic mindset.
