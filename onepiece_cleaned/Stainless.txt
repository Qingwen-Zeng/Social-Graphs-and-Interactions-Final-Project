Vice Admiral Stainless
is a
Marine
officer who participated in the
Summit War of Marineford
. In the anime, his name was said to be
Kaizeruhige
(
カイゼルヒゲ
,
Kaizeruhige
?
)
.
Appearance
[
]
Stainless is a tall man standing at a similar height to Momonga, who is 8'3 or 251 cm, he is also a well built individual. His most distinctive feature is his handlebar mustache. His hair is black and combed back with a scalp lock, but by the time at the meeting in Mary Geoise, it was more straightly combed.
He dresses in the typical garb of many high-ranking Marines: when discussing about Luffy and later Crocodile's replacement, he wore a purple suit (which was striped during the first meeting, but not during the second), but during Marineford, he changes to a yellow and black striped suit over a dark red shirt with an orange tie. He wears a marine coat hanging from his shoulders like a cape.
Personality
[
]
As a Marine, Stainless has a strong sense of justice. He does not like
Doflamingo
and his actions, as the pirate manipulated his associate to attack him, causing both
vice admirals
to become panicked and confused.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a vice admiral, Stainless is capable of commanding a Buster Call alongside four other vice admirals. He also has command over lower-ranking subordinates. However, he was no match for
Crocodile
.
Weapons
[
]
He carries a katana during the battle of Marineford, like most of the vice admirals. His exact level of swordsmanship remains unknown; however, it is presumably quite high, with him being a vice admiral.
Haki
[
]
It was stated that all vice admirals possess
Haki
,
so Stainless can also use the ability.
