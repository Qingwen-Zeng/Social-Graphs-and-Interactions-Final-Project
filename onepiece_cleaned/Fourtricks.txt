Appearance

Due to the nature of his

transformation, much of Fourtricks' body is transformed into a large rooster, although his head is at the chicken's rear end. He wears sunglasses over his eyes and has pronounced lips, and his hair is a massive pompadour resembling a chicken's tail. He has a tattoo of the number 4 on both his left cheek and on the left side of his chicken's head, as well as a tattoo of the word "Tricks" on his forehead over his left eye. He has normal arms stretching down from the top of the chicken's backside, but his legs seem to have transformed into those of a chicken.

Fourtricks ate a Chicken
SMILE
(
ニワトリの
SMILE
,
Niwatori no Sumairu
?
)
, which transformed his torso into an entire chicken with his legs turning into chicken legs. Unlike a normal Zoan user, rather than his head becoming a chicken's head, the chicken has a sentient head of its own while Fourtricks' body is located in its backside. No combat applications of this fruit have been seen so far.
In the anime, the chicken was strong enough to lift up a full grown man using it's beak.
