Ninpō: Jigoku Biwa

History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
While
O-Robi
was sneaking around
Orochi Castle
, Benten and the rest of the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
silently appeared behind her.
The group surrounded Robin, but Benten and the others were shocked when her
body double
dissipated after being attacked.
After
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution, the Orochi Oniwabanshu arrived to help fight off the
Straw Hat Pirates
. Benten shot at
Roronoa Zoro
with her concealed firearm but was unable to hit the pirate.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Benten accompanied
Kurozumi Orochi
to
Onigashima
. After
Kaidou
disposed of Orochi for his
New Onigashima Project
, Benten did not object to
Fukurokuju
swearing the Oniwabanshu's allegiance to Kaidou when given the choice of joining the
Beasts Pirates
or death.
As the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
waged war in Kaidou's fortress, the Oniwabanshu fought the rebels. After
Queen
unleashed the
Ice Oni
virus, Benten and her allies found themselves under attack by those infected.
When the little
Hyougoro
, infected with the Ice Oni, again became the former boss of the yakuza, which he did in his youth, Orochi Oniwabanshu is amazed at this fact, asking what happened to him and how the old man became the one Kaidou wanted to get on his team.
