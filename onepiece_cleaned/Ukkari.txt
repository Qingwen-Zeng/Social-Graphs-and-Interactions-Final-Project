Live-Action and Manga Differences
[
]
In the
live-action series
, Ukkari is shown as a more mature man. The scene raising the statue of Morgan is not included, and his role changes to a slightly more notable one, being a Marine at
Ririka
's bar with whom
Nami
flirts and then knocks him unconscious to rob him his uniform. Later, after Nami is discovered in the
base
by his partner
Sada
, Ukkari recognizes her and they both attack the intruder, but end up being defeated by her. Moments later, Ukkari and Sada are found badly injured by
Morgan
, whom they notify about Nami's infiltration.
He is later crucified by Morgan in the base's courtyard, presumably as punishment. He witnesses
Garp's
arrival at the base, and is ultimately released from his bonds by the time Morgan is tied up.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
His name is a katakana rendition of the Japanese term for "careless"
(
浮かり
,
Ukari
?
, lit. "floaty")
.
Viz Media
's official
One Piece
translator Stephen Paul informally translated this as "Carelesso"
, which was later adopted by Shueisha's official website for the 7th
popularity poll
.
