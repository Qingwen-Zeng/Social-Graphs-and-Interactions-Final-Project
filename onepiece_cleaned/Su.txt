History

Sky Island Saga
[

Skypiea Arc
[
]
After the Straw Hat Pirates arrived on Skypiea, Su approached the crew. As
Zoro
asked what the creature was, Conis, playing music, introduced herself and Su to the crew.
Su watched as
Luffy
and
Nami
tried Conis'
Waver
and followed them back to Conis' home for dinner.
While the Straw Hats were fighting in the
Upper Yard
, Su sat next to Conis as she, Pagaya, and
Gan Fall
discussed the island's current situation. Su was also seen drinking some of Pagaya's pumpkin juice.
Su was later seen riding with Pagaya, Conis, and
Aisa
in Pagaya's
dial boat
. By the time they met up with Nami, Su had already fallen asleep.
Su awoke soon after, as she was seen on the deck of the
Going Merry
.
After Nami and Aisa left, Pagaya asked Su to keep watch on the ship.
When she saw someone approach, Su began calling out loudly, gaining Conis and Pagaya's attention. After Pagaya was attacked by
Enel
, Conis left Su in charge of watching Sanji and Usopp who were healing below deck.
While Conis was gone, Sanji and Usopp recuperated and decided to help Luffy fight Enel. Su tried to convince them not to go, but her efforts did not stop them.
When Conis returned, she saw Su in a worried state, trying to tell her owner of their departure.
Su calmed down with Conis' return.
She was seen in Conis' arms when Enel began to destroy the island.
She was also seen trying to comfort Conis, who blamed herself for endangering the Straw Hats by getting involved in the affairs with Enel.
Conis confided to Su about her desire to be saved by Luffy and his crew.
Su was seen in her owner's arms once again when that desire came true
As the Straw Hat Pirates prepare to leave Skypiea, Su, Conis, and Pagaya see them off.
