Personality

Kakukaku is an erudite and so possesses great knowledge and learning and loves to get into long discussions and arguments with others. However, he gets scared very easily and will start trembling in fear when afraid.
He also cares greatly for the well-being of respectable individuals, such as their mayor, as shown when he displayed a face of concern and was worried about Iceburg after he had been shot.
