As a fish-man, Sunbell possesses ten times the physical strength of an average human and is presumably an adept swimmer.
While Sunbell's overall strength is kept unknown in the manga, the anime does showcase him ina non-canon sequence where he clashes with a younger
Vista
, implying Sunbell is rather strong himself.

Past
[
]
At some point, Sunbell joined the Roger Pirates. Thirty-eight years ago Sunbell was seen along with the
Roger Pirates
arriving at
God Valley
preparing to engage the
Rocks Pirates
in what would later be labeled as the
God Valley Incident
.
27 years ago, he and his crew fought against the
Golden Lion Pirates
during the
Battle of Edd War
.
A year later, on an island in
Paradise
, the Roger Pirates defeated a battalion of Marines when they spotted the
Whitebeard Pirates
approaching them.
When the Whitebeard Pirates arrived, the two crews battled each other for four days until the fight settled into a gift exchange.
Roger
pleaded for
Whitebeard
to allow his subordinate
Kouzuki Oden
to join the Roger Pirates and help them reach the final island.
When Oden and his family boarded the
Oro Jackson
, the crew initially treated Oden coldly, but they quickly warmed up to him as friends as they sailed to many destinations including
Skypiea
,
Water 7
,
Fish-Man Island
,
Wano Country
, and
Zou
. They then made it to the final island and laughed when they saw the treasure left behind by
Joy Boy
.
After departing from the island named
Laugh Tale
by Roger, the crew had a party before tearfully bidding farewell to their captain. They then took Oden back to his home in Wano and the crew tearfully said goodbye to him as well. The Roger Pirates disbanded, and it is unknown what became of Sunbell.
