Wano Country Arc

Ikkaku commentated on the sumo matches occurring in Bakura Town, which the yokozuna
Urashima
was utterly dominating. When Urashima expressed romantic interest in a woman named
O-Kiku
in the crowd, Ikkaku and those around him were greatly interested in this development. However, O-Kiku responded to Urashima's actions by cutting off his topknot, leaving Ikkaku and the others completely aghast.
