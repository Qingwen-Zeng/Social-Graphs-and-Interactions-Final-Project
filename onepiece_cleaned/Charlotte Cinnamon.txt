Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Cinnamon attended the
Tea Party
and
wedding
of
Sanji
and her younger sister
Charlotte Pudding
, in which she took part in
her mother
's plan to assassinate the
Vinsmoke Family
.
She socialized with some of the other attendees before Sanji and Pudding arrived to the venue.

After
Monkey D. Luffy
and the rest of the
Sanji Retrieval Team
crashed the event, she witnessed with her sister
Citron
as
Jinbe
broke ties with the
Big Mom Pirates
.
Despite the intrusion, the Big Mom Pirates carried on with their scheme and trapped the Vinsmokes and held them at gun point, with Cinnamon aiming her
Walker
at
Judge
. She watched Judge's emotional breakdown
and
Perospero
's taunting.
She accompanied her sisters on
Smoothie
's ship as they chased the
Thousand Sunny
on the seas of
Totto Land
.
Smoothie's fleet continued pursuit of the Thousand Sunny while Perospero and
Bavarois
's fleet split off to follow Big Mom and the
Fire Tank Pirates
'
Nostra Castello
.
When Smoothie increased her size to attack the Sunny, Cinnamon looked worried as Smoothie's increased size could cause structural damage to her own ship.
When Smoothie's fleet reached
Cacao Island
, they focused on pursuing the Straw Hats instead of fighting the
Germa 66
fleet that had arrived.
The
Sun Pirates
also appeared and stopped Smoothie's ship from moving.
The combined forces of the Germa 66 and Sun Pirates held off Big Mom's fleet long enough for the Sunny to escape.
