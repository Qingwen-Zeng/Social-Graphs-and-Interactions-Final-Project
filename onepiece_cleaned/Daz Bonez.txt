"The Killer" Daz Bonez
is a former
bounty hunter
who joined
Baroque Works
and was the highest ranked male
Officer Agent
and the strongest under
Crocodile
himself.
His codename was
Mr. 1
and his partner was
Miss Doublefinger
.
He was a major antagonist during the
Arabasta Arc
, and after these events he was captured and sent to
Impel Down
. He escaped during the
Impel Down Arc
and was traveling together with Crocodile in the
New World
, and is now currently affiliated with the Organization,
Cross Guild
, along with Crocodile.
Appearance
[
]
Daz is a tanned man with long, thin limbs and fingers. He is tall and very muscular and his head is shaven. His most striking feature is probably the black
unibrow
, right over his round eyes. He has big lips and the archaic Japanese symbol of the number "1"
(
å£±
,
ichi
?
)
tattooed on his torso.
In
Arabasta
, he sported an oriental-looking attire consisting of a sleeveless dark coat with golden edges and white motifs on the front, over very loose beige pants held up by a white sash around the waist, with some light brown fur sprouting from it. His pants were tucked inside some bandages wrapped around his calves and in part around his shoes.
In
Impel Down
, like most prisoners, he wore striped prisoner clothing. He gained a scar to the right of his right eye, likely a result of something that occurred while or after he was taken to Impel Down.
(Due to the fact that he lacked such a scar or any sort of facial injury during the
Miss Goldenweek
mini arc
, it is impossible for him to have obtained the scar during his fight with Zoro.) During his break-out of his cell, he was bare-chested, with his shirt tied around his waist.
After the
Summit War of Marineford
, he sports a dark suit over a plain open shirt, with a tie kept loose around his neck.
After timeskip, he still wears a black suit, but sports a pink open shirt instead of a white one.
Personality
[
]
Daz is very stern, calm, focused, disciplined, self-assured and confident. Due to his
Devil Fruit
abilities, he has come to think of himself as unbeatable. He is laconic and serious at all times and does not tolerate weakness or frivolity. Daz also has the belief that having friendships makes one weak. Surprisingly, he does not seem to care for grudges either; he assisted Luffy in the escape from Impel Down due to Crocodile's orders, barely noting the fact that Zoro and Luffy are companions.
Mr. 1 was notorious within the West Blue for his previous profession as an assassin (under his real name "Daz Bonez"), implying he was (and still is) highly skilled at stealth and killing efficiently. He also demonstrated to be merciless to those that dare challenge him to combat, and is not concerned with the swordsmen code of conduct, as he attacked Zoro while in a vulnerable and defenseless position. However, he demonstrates high loyalty to those that treat him with respect (Crocodile), and is not a petty man clouded by past bias or judgements.
In battle, he is utterly merciless and bloodthirsty, demonstrating this when he hit
Roronoa Zoro
while the pirate was wounded and unable to defend himself after licking his enemy's blood off his own hands.
He was also indifferent to the fate of a fellow prisoner that he knocked into a boiling pot; at the same time, he licked the blood trickling down from his own head injury.
Nevertheless, Daz does have some sense of honor, as he accepted his defeat at Zoro's hands.
While Daz is generally a cold-hearted person, as a child, he secretly had a dream of becoming a superhero. When
Miss Goldenweek
materialized this dream, his face showed great discomfort, but he was actually quite thrilled in secret.
Relationships
[
]
Baroque Works
[
]
Mr. 1 reunited with Mr. 0 and Baroque Works' Officer Agents.
Much like his boss,
Crocodile
, Bonez generally views allies as hindrances rather than assets. His relationship with
Miss Doublefinger
is a professional partnership, with both of them working together to accomplish any task set before them.
While Mr. 1 generally has mostly the same type of indifferent professional relationship with a majority of the Baroque Works Agents, he is on bad terms with Mr. 2 Bon Kurei. Because Mr. 2's flamboyant nature conflicts with his static and cold-hearted demeanor , the two of them would often engaged in fights with one another, very similar in nature to their future opponents,
Roronoa Zoro
(who had beaten Daz), and
Sanji
(who had beaten Mr. 2). Ever since first meeting each other in Spiders Cafe, they have had this type of rivalry relationship, even in Impel Down's breakout.
Nevertheless, Daz has shown complete obedience and a fiercely loyalty towards Crocodile, as when most of their colleagues left prison, Daz stayed behind with his boss and awaited transfer to Impel Down. He later joined the riot in Impel Down, stating it was because Crocodile asked.
He even fought
Dracule Mihawk
, the world's greatest swordsman, on Crocodile's command, and his loyalty was rewarded when Crocodile himself saved both Daz and Luffy's lives from Mihawk. When Crocodile announced his journey to the New World, he offered Mr. 1 to join him, to which he obliged without hesitation.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Formerly a bounty hunter from the West Blue known as "The Killer", Daz Bonez is a proficient hand-to-hand martial artist and highly dangerous combatant feared for his talents in assassinating criminals. Even
Smoker
, a formidably powerful Marine in his own right, acknowledged Bonez as a powerful opponent and was surprised Zoro managed to defeat him.
Befitting his profession, he has considerable knowledge in assassination, as seen when he started targeting
Nami
before
Zoro
in
Alubarna
, saying that the first rule of assassination is "pick off the weakest target first".
His power was great enough to put him in the Level 4 of Impel Down, where he defeated a fellow prisoner easily.
His strength is such that he can defeat many members of the
Whitebeard Pirates
and their allies from the
New World
.
His strength has earned Crocodile's respect, something that most
Baroque Works
members, and even Crocodile's right-hand woman,
Nico Robin
, did not receive. Crocodile went out of his way to free Daz from his cell to assist him in the
upcoming war
.
His skills are substantial enough to be recognized by the world's greatest
swordsman
,
Dracule Mihawk
, who does not bother to remember the names of those who he considers weaklings.
He is strong enough to be unafraid of the
New World
as he has no problem going there.
It can also be surmised that after two years, Daz grew much stronger, as he not only survived his time in the New World with Crocodile, but also helped destroy the Marine ships sent after Buggy after the dissolution of the Warlords system.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Even without his Devil Fruit powers, he is a very dangerous and extremely strong man, possessing considerable superhuman strength and endurance. This was seen when he was incarcerated in
Impel Down
and simply gave a headbutt to a fellow prisoner (who was larger than him) that proved strong enough to knock the man over a great distance. Mr. 1 was also most likely wearing
seastone
shackles at the time, and was punched by the prisoner hard in the head, but simply shrugged the pain off before retaliating.
Even the intense heat of Level 4 seemed to have little to no effect on him.
Bonez also managed to block a slash from  Mihawk, although the following attack cut him down instantly.
Mr. 1 was approximately equal to Roronoa Zoro physically in Arabasta, where the latter managed to lift up a largely intact building off the ground with his bare hands.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Supa Supa no Mi
Daz Bonez wielding the Supa Supa no Mi.
Daz ate the Supa Supa no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to turn any part of his body into sharp steel blades.
This power gives him a near endless variety of slashing abilities, and it makes his body as hard as steel, making him almost immune to damage.
He can transform any body parts of his choosing into blades, allowing him to perfectly combine blade work with martial arts skills, literally making him a living weapon; he can turn his arms into blades to augment his hand chops, turn his legs into blades to augment his kicks, turn his fingers into blades to make them like razor sharp claws, and even turn the bottoms of his feet into blades so that he can glide across the ground as if he were ice skating. Since his entire body is a blade, his blades have no front or back, making his swordplay difficult to counter.
Notably, he can move his blades across his skin. For example, he can extend curved blades from his forearm at an angle perpendicular to his arm, then make the blades rotate around his arm, effectively turning his forearms into mini-tiller blades that shred anything they touch.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Before joining with Baroque Works, Daz was an infamous bounty hunter from
West Blue
and was known as "The Killer" for his deadly skills.
He was one of the most well-known bounty hunters in the world to the point where even Zoro, who was on the other side of the Red Line, had heard of him.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
After joining and working for
Baroque Works
for an unspecified amount of time, he got the nickname "Mr. 1" and was called to assemble with the other
Officer Agents
for the fulfillment of Baroque Works' ultimate goal,
Operation Utopia
. Arriving at
Spiders Cafe
in
Arabasta
, the designated meeting place, Mr. 1 came across a bunch of suspicious guys dancing outside. Beating and throwing them into the cafe, he learned that they were
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
's
subordinates
. Despite leaving them barely alive, this action caused a brief scuffle between him and Mr. 2. Before it could get out of hand, Mr. 1's partner,
Miss Doublefinger
, stopped them so that they could meet their mysterious boss, Mr. 0, in
Rainbase
.
Mr. 1 and his fellow
Officer Agents
burning their orders in order to keep secret ceremoniously.
After being transported to Rainbase by
Banchi
, Mr. 1 and his fellow Officer Agents were led to a room that was submerged underwater. There they were greeted by
Miss All Sunday
, who revealed to them not only that they were under the casino of Rain Dinners, but also the identity of their boss, the
Warlord of the Sea
Crocodile
. After a brief revelation, Mr. 1 and his fellow agents were informed of the goal of their final plan and what they had to do to achieve it. Just as they were finishing up the meeting, a new complication however arose before Mr. 1 and his fellow agents.
Mr. 3
, a fellow agent who snuck into the meeting, revealed to them that he had failed in his mission to assassinate
Princess Vivi
and her pirate companions. With this new information and some faces provided by Mr. 2 who happened to have met the pirates in question, Mr. 1 and his fellow agents were ordered by Crocodile to be on the look out for Vivi and the pirates. As Vivi was a friend of the leader of the rebellion that was happening in Arabasta,
Koza
, their meeting with could spell ruin for Operation Utopia. With this final order, Mr. 1 and his fellow agents went to fulfill their parts in their final mission.
As the mission commenced in
Nanohana
, Mr. 1 and Miss Doublefinger took over a gigantic weapons ship and crashed it into the port town. With the damage caused by the ship and the farce perpetuated by Mr. 2 masquerading as the king of Arabasta,
Nefertari Cobra
, at the same time, Mr. 1 and his fellow agents had set off a series of events that would provoke the rebels into fighting against the king and his army. As Mr. 1 and Miss Doublefinger were leaving, they found out that a little boy,
Kappa
, had discovered the truth behind Mr. 2's trick. Seeing the potential danger, they messed the boy up so he would not ruin the mission before leaving with Mr. 2 to
Alubarna
, the capital of Arabasta.
Mr. 1 and Miss Doublefinger face off against Zoro and Nami respectively.
Regrouping with the rest of the Officer Agents at the western most gate of the city, Mr. 1 and his fellow agents were told to wait there for Vivi and her pirate companions which they learned would be coming. Soon enough, they saw the princess and her companions arriving on
Super Spot-Billed Ducks
. To their surprise, Mr. 1 and his fellow agents noticed there were six cloaked figures heading toward them, all wearing the same type of cloak. Since the six cloaked figures were all riding Super Spot-Billed Ducks, the quickest animal in Arabasta, Mr. 1 and his fellow agents unfortunately could not catch the group as it split up and passed them heading to one of the five city gates. Not knowing which one of the was Vivi, Mr. 1 and his fellow agents split up as well to catch the cloaked figures. Following two cloaked figures who passed through the westernmost gate with his partner, Mr. 1 caught up with them. However much to his and Miss Doublefinger's surprise, not one of the two they followed was Vivi. Instead they were
Zoro
and
Nami
.
Mr. 1 defeated by Zoro.
Seeing that Nami was the weaker of the two, Mr. 1 and Miss Doublefinger decided to get rid of her first. However, in the midst of an attack against her, Mr. 1's attack was blocked by Zoro. Recognizing the pirate as the one who had defeated the one hundred
Millions
agents who worked at
Whisky Peak
and the one who had killed the previous
Mr. 7
, Mr. 1 soon got into a battle with the pirate hunter while Miss Doublefinger went off to battle Nami. Having a body as hard as steel thanks to his Devil Fruit powers, Mr. 1 was able to withstand all of Zoro's attacks.
Despite this, Mr. 1's opponent was able to withstand his attacks as well. As the battle continued, Mr. 1 attacked Zoro more brutally with each attack. Much to Mr. 1's surprise, no matter what he did, his opponent would not fall down regardless of the wounds Mr. 1 inflicted on him. In the apex of the battle with his opponent completely covered with blood and wounds, Mr. 1 decided to finish Zoro once and for all. However, at that very moment, his opponent was finally able to slash through Mr. 1's metal body.
Completely wounded from the slash, Mr. 1 admitted his defeat and fell unconscious.
After Operation Utopia failed with
Luffy
beating Crocodile, Mr. 1 was found and arrested by the Marines headed by Tashigi.
He and the other arrested Baroque Works agents were then sent to prison.
Water 7 Saga

Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
[
]
After being arrested, Daz, along with Crocodile and the other arrested Officer Agents were imprisoned in a Marine base. There, he, Crocodile, and Mr. 4 established themselves as the strongest amongst the male prisoners there.
As time passed, they were soon visited by the most unexpected of visitors,
Miss Goldenweek
and the Mr. 5 team. With a mission to free their imprisoned colleagues, Miss Goldenweek and her group infiltrated the Marine base and freed Daz and the others from their cells.
Though he was offered freedom, Daz, along with Crocodile, decided to voluntarily stay behind in their cell.
As they remained in the ruins that their fellow agents made for their escape, Daz and Crocodile were affected by a hypnotic technique from Miss Goldenweek that materialized their deepest dreams. Though Crocodile was annoyed by this, Daz on the other hand, was secretly delighted that his past dream of becoming a superhero was materialized.
Continuing to refuse freedom, they were soon greeted by Mr. 2 and
Mr. 3
who were both just captured by Captain
Hina
. Together, the four Baroque Works members were sent to
Impel Down
.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Impel Down Arc
[
]
Daz was incarcerated in the Level 4 "Blazing Hell" of Impel Down. While they were carrying logs for the fire pit, a runaway prisoner tried to knock Bonez aside, but in response, Bonez headbutted the prisoner, knocking him into the boiling blood pot, much to the annoyance of the guards.
He also noticed the attempt that Luffy was making to reach level 5.
When Crocodile was freed and escaped from Level 6 along with Luffy,
Ivankov
,
Inazuma
, and
Jinbe
, he offered to free Daz to provide him some backup and he agreed.
Later, he joined the main force alongside Luffy and Mr. 2 Bon Kurei. As Blackbeard caused the leaders of this main force to stop,
Magellan
was able to follow them once taking out
Blackbeard
and his crew without much effort. Although Ivankov and Inazuma tried to stop Magellan, he still overcame them and as soon as Daz, along with the other rioters, joined with Buggy's forces, Magellan attacked them. Fortunately, they were saved by Mr. 3
Galdino
's wax abilities.

As Luffy decided to take on Magellan with Galdino's abilities, Daz, Crocodile, Jinbe, Bon Kurei, Buggy, and the other rioters made their way to the main entrance in order to get a ship. Although they expected Marine ships to attack them, instead they were sailing away. As it seemed to be too late to get a ship, Daz, Crocodile and Buggy rode on a makeshift raft carried by Jinbe and were easily able to get onto one of the marine ships with the help of Jinbe's fish-man abilities. He and Crocodile alone managed to defeat all the Marines on the battleship. He then mocked
Buggy
for being completely useless during the battle.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Once everyone managed to board the ship, the Marines revealed that Buggy was a member of Gol D. Roger's crew. Daz wondered why he was so weak if it was true.
He was then seen alongside the other Impel Down fugitives, falling from the sky to Marineford, to support Crocodile and to assist in the Whitebeard War.
He was later seen alongside Crocodile fighting the
Whitebeard Pirates
.

Later in the battle, Daz, under Crocodile's orders, helped Luffy by stopping
Dracule Mihawk
's attacks with his
powers
. Mihawk seemed to know about him, but his abilities were not enough to stand up to the Warlord of the Sea, and he was easily defeated. Crocodile himself intervened in the fight, saving both Daz and Luffy.
Post-War Arc
[
]
Daz with Crocodile after the war.
Three weeks after the war, he and Crocodile were shown on an unknown island in the Grand Line. After reading a newspaper article concerning Luffy, Daz commented on how crazy the Straw Hat captain is. Daz added that Luffy was wounded and wounds do not heal quickly. Crocodile contradicted Daz's remark saying that he himself was healed, and decided to head out to the
New World
as proof. Crocodile then invited Daz to go with him. Daz naturally accepted the offer without hesitation.
