Appearance
[

Haredas is an old man whoÂ has a long, white beard and long, straight hair of the same color, that fall on his back. He wears a blue pointed hat that matches his wizard-like robe, which stretches down to his feet. In the manga, he is fairly tall, whereas in the anime, he is rather short. Sometimes, Haredas' eyes are shown large and shining, much like
Nyon
's when she admires
Hancock
's cuteness.
Personality
[
]
Haredas has shown to have a rather carefree upbeat personality, smiling and seemingly enjoying himself mostly. He is also slightly absent-minded and bumbling and tends to repeat certain many things he already said and introduced before. Also, he is shown to be very patient and even after Nami kept (inappropriately) hitting him, and still maintained his friendly attitude with her.
He has a habit to address to people repeatedly "oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi" ("hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey") instead of only one time.
Relationships
[

Nami
[
]
Haredas is very patient with Nami, despite her ungrateful and, at times, physically abusive attitude toward him.
He was shocked by her idea of using the
Weather Ball
as a weapon, but he gladly mentored her in the science of Weatheria regardless.
When Nami returned to her crew on
Sabaody Archipelago
, Haredas commented that Weatheria would be lonelier without her.
He and the other scientists want to impress her, as seen from their choice to dress better after she left.
Weatheria Scientists
[

Haredas is well respected by his peers. They care deeply for his wellbeing, and they were very concerned when Nami took him hostage, chasing her.
Abilities and Powers

As a scientist of Weatheria, Haredas has great knowledge about the weather-based science of the place, and uses it, to great effects, to control weather. This is showcased by him tutoring Nami in the arts of weather manipulation.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Haredas uses a technique in the form of a bubble-like barrier that allows him to be unfazed by the extreme weather while walking in Weatheria. Whether this is some new (or old) technique or possibly a type of technology native to the sky islands is unknown at this time.

Haredas first appears when
Nami
ends up on Weatheria, due to the events of
Sabaody Archipelago
. He shows her around the island, and displays to her how to use the wind knot to call forth a variety of wind phenomenons ranging from a gentle breeze to a mighty squall.
Haredas also has Nami accompany him during a business transaction on Weatheria and teaches her some about the island's weather science.
Haredas tells Nami about the New World climate.
When Nami was locked up for stealing weather equipment, Haredas, having felt sorry for her, let her go after hearing about her captain
Monkey D. Luffy
and the pain he was in after losing his brother
Portgas D. Ace
in the
Whitebeard War
. As soon as she was released, Nami kidnaps him and takes the stolen goods with her as well. Nami runs off with Haredas under her arm, telling him to help her to return to the Blue Seas. When she was crying again (this time not faking it), Haredas believed it to be once again fake, and brings it up, to which Nami snapped at him to be quiet.
When Nami stops to read the article about Luffy infiltrating Marineford, Haredas reminds her that their pursuers are still chasing them.
After seeing Luffy's message, Nami got the Weatheria inhabitants to give her a place to stay. Haredas agreed to teach Nami about the weather of the New World, but scolded Nami for commenting on using the
Weather Ball
as a weapon, which could be disastrous to the world.
