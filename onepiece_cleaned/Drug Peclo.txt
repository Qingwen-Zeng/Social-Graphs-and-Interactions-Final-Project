began belittling Peclo, causing Peclo to retaliate.
Charlotte Perospero
welcomed the emperors to the

Ichiji
at a table with some other guests.

emerged from the wedding cake, and Peclo ran away from the explosion.
Peclo was later shocked to witness Big Mom
taking the chefs' lifespans
in a fit of rage after the wedding cake was ruined.
Right after

dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau, the bomb inside the chest exploded, causing the chateau to topple over. As the castle collapsed, Drug Peclo fell with it.
