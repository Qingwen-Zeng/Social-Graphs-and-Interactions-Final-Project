Hyoutauros is a large, muscular jaguar centaur with tan skin and a long blond beard. He has small dark eyes, a wide nose, and predominant cheekbones. He wears a striped blue cap and a jaguar print top over his left shoulder.
Personality
[
]
Hyoutauros is a bit absent-minded, as he mistook
Monkey D. Luffy
for a centaur (when Luffy had
Kin'emon's
legs attached to him).
He is also persistent, which was shown when he pursued Luffy, threw a boulder at him from a distance, and called to his comrades after being injured for the sake of stopping invaders.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Despite his stature, Hyoutauros is not very strong compared to Luffy, who defeated him with a single hit.
Regardless, he was able to regain consciousness quickly, pursue Luffy and his crew, and throw a boulder a decent distance at them, showing that he still had some strength despite being injured.
Weapons
[
]
Hyoutauros fights with a metal spiked club, but it is unknown how skilled he is at using it. The club was destroyed by Luffy.
History

Punk Hazard Arc
[

Hyoutauros was patrolling the
Burning Lands
when he came across Luffy. Mistakening him for another centaur, Hyoutauros struck up a conversation and laughed with him. Suddenly, he realized that Luffy was not a centaur and tried to attack him. However, Luffy caught his club and kicked him down, defeating the centaur.
After he regained consciousness, Hyoutauros pursued the
Straw Hat Pirates
to the edge of the lake that separates the two halves of the island. He tried to throw a boulder at the crew's Banana Raft but barely missed. He then blew into a horn and called out to his
Boss
to signal that the invaders were on their way.

Anime and Manga Differences

Hyoutauros and Luffy meet.
In the anime, the initial interaction between Hyoutauros and Luffy is shown, and their conversation is extended. They are shown racing each other, and Hyoutauros's realization that Luffy is an intruder is spurred by a
Den Den Mushi
call from
Kirintauros
. In the manga, the reason for his realization is unknown. Luffy also refers to the centaur as "Hyoutauros."
