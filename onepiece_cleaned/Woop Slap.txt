Woop Slap
is the mayor of
Monkey D. Luffy
's hometown,
Foosha Village
.
Appearance
[
]
Woop Slap is a short, wiry, bespectacled man with something of a cleft chin. He generally wears lightweight "tropical" clothing, along with a selection of striped hats.
As a younger man, he once wore his facial hair as stubble, but has since grown them into a full mustache and goatee. His age has also caused him to take up a walking cane.
Personality
[
]
For the most part, Woop Slap is a typical village elder: practical, humorless, and disdainful of
pirates
(with the semi-exception of
Shanks
). As such, he is Foosha Village's loudest—if not only—critic against
Luffy
's dreams of piracy, and has remained so long after
Luffy's crew
attained
worldwide
notoriety.
At the same time, he cares deeply for his village, and is willing to go to great lengths for its people, Luffy included. Such is his dedication that, despite his irascible personality, he has managed to remain mayor for more than a decade.
Relationships
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Although Woop Slap often criticizes
Monkey D. Luffy
's choice to become a pirate and his growing infamy, he seems to actually care for his well-being, such as when he pleaded for
Higuma
to spare Luffy's life when he was a young boy. He believed that Luffy is better than the choice of his crew who became infamous with him, referring to them as "freaks". Woop Slap knows of how Luffy was born and his origin.
Woop Slap also questioned Garp on what happened to Luffy after the
battle
, worrying about the boy's safety. However, he does not seem pleased to learn that the
Straw Hat Pirates
have revived two years later.
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
He is familiar with
Vice Admiral
Monkey D. Garp
and his family (including
Dragon
, who few people knew about until recently), stating how he thinks all three generations of Garp's family are crazy. He also knows about Garp leaving his grandsons at the care of
Curly Dadan
, a
mountain bandit boss
, something that only he and Makino in the village knew about.
Regardless, they seem to be close friends, as the mayor asked about how Luffy was upon Garp's return. When Garp was declared MIA, Woop Slap revealed that Garp cannot die that easily.
Makino
[
]
Woop Slap seems to talk to
Makino
often about Luffy as she appears to be the only one in the village willing to listen to him.
Dadan
[
]
He appears to be on good terms with
Curly Dadan
. He is the first one to mention her existence by wondering if Dadan knew about the
Enies Lobby
incident.
History
[

Past
[
]
Around the time of
Gol D. Roger
's execution, Woop Slap was already well-acquainted with both
Makino
(then a child) and
Vice Admiral
Monkey D. Garp
, though apparently unaware of Garp's arrangement with the
Dadan Family
to care for Roger's
infant son
.
East Blue Saga

Romance Dawn Arc

The villagers watch as Luffy departs.
Some time after Woop Slap became mayor of Foosha Village, the
Red Hair Pirates
began using it as a friendly port. Though mostly tolerant of their
captain
Shanks
, Woop Slap distrusted their general influence on the village; he was especially unsettled by the seven-year-old
Monkey D. Luffy
unwittingly eating the
Gomu Gomu no Mi
in their company, and constantly condemned Luffy's dreams of
piratehood
.
Nevertheless, when Makino alerted him that the
Higuma
Bandits
had captured Luffy, Woop Slap immediately ran to the scene and pled for the boy's life, even offering to pay ransom. While these efforts were dismissed by Higuma, they stalled him long enough for Shanks' crew to intervene and defeat the bandits.
When Luffy, Ace,
Sabo
,
Dadan
and her bandits visited Partys Bar, Woop Slap was seen scolding Luffy.
Woop Slap was present to see Ace leaving the village.
Ten years later, Luffy left the village to pursue his dreams in earnest; though still opposed, Woop Slap joined many other villagers at the local harbor to see off the would-be Pirate King.
Loguetown Arc
[
]
To Woop Slap's dismay, Luffy thrived as a pirate, assembled a
crew
, and soon earned a premiere
bounty
of
30,000,000 for defeating the
East Blue
's most fearsome pirates. This
news
was much-celebrated by the rest of Foosha Village, causing Woop Slap to sharply rebuke them. In private, however, he questioned if Luffy's infamy was in fact inevitable.
Water 7 Saga

Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
News of the Straw Hats'
attack
on
Enies Lobby
—an unprecedented declaration of war that raised Luffy's bounty to
300,000,000—brought fresh celebrations from Foosha Village, and left Woop Slap complaining more bitterly than ever. Deeming Garp and all his descendants hopeless (and Luffy's crewmates "freaks"), he then wondered over Dadan's reaction.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Post-War Arc
[
]
When Garp returned to Foosha Village following the
Summit War of Marineford
, Woop Slap quietly asked after Luffy, whom
newspapers
had declared missing. To this, Garp truthfully replied that Luffy had escaped
Marineford
in a
submarine
.

Two years after the Summit War, newspapers confirmed that Luffy was not only alive, but reassembling his crew and continuing his voyages; as his fellow villagers rejoiced, Woop Slap once again found himself the lone dissenter.

Luffy's next major exploit, dethroning
Donquixote Doflamingo
in
Dressrosa
, raised predictable responses from both Woop Slap and the rest of Foosha Village (including the
Dadan Family
).
The following events are
Non-Canon

Levely Arc

On receiving news of Luffy's
Totto Land exploits
(and recognition as the
"Fifth Emperor"
), Woop Slap immediately ran to
Makino
with his typical complaints.

The Legendary Log! Red-Haired Shanks!
[
]
Woop Slap sat in
Partys Bar
with
Makino
and
her child
, reading the
newspaper
. He let slip that he was looking for news on
Shanks
, to see if he was doing alright, and Makino reassured him that the pirate was probably fine, though Woop Slap feigned ignorance and pretended that he didn't care about Shanks anyways.
A few minutes later, he noticed an article announcing
Uta
's concert on
Elegia
, and was reminded of her identity as Shanks' daughter by Makino. He thought back to her disappearance, and was proud to have another famous figure from
Foosha Village
.

Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
After Garp went missing in action on
Hachinosu
, Woop Slap assured other concerned civilians that Garp would be fine. He then scolded someone for laughing at the news, then apologized after realizing it was Makino's baby that had laughed and that he had caused the baby to cry. Later, Woop Slap was confused upon seeing an unexpected high tide that resulted from the world's water level rising.
As
Vegapunk
's broadcast began, many villagers complained to Woop Slap about their lack of a Visual
Den Den Mushi
. Woop Slap sternly told them that they simply couldn't afford it, and that audio was good enough.
