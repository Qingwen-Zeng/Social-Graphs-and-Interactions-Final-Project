Drum Island Arc
[
]
While his father was busy tending to his restaurant's customers, Tamachibi was wailing excessively, which led to the customers complaining to his father about the noise. His father tried to ask him what was wrong, but Tamachibi could not respond due to the pain and only continued crying, causing his father to threaten to put him outside. Meanwhile, Dr. Kureha was passing by the restaurant and heard what Tamachibi's father had said. She then busted down the restaurant's door and decided to treat Tamachibi.

Tamachibi was then laid down on a table where he explained that his hands were hurting, to which Kureha then pressed his legs, causing Tamachibi to wail in pain. Kureha then explained that, even though she only pressed lightly, it appeared that his limbs were infected and that he had a case of pyogenic inflammation of the bone. To the horror of his father, Tamachibi was then knocked unconscious by
Tony Tony Chopper
in lieu of anesthetics. After the surgery, Kureha made an unreasonable demand of fifty percent of the restaurant's assets, to which the restaurant's customers complained. However, Tamachibi then woke up and said that he felt much better, thanking Kureha for helping relieve his pain. Hearing this, his father decided to pay Kureha what she demanded.
