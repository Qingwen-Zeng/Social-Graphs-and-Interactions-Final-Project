Kamakiri warned
Aisa
not to go collecting
Vearth
from the
Upper Yard
anymore, and was angered when she mentioned that he still could not defeat
Enel
.
After the meeting, together with the warriors, they started moving to the God's Shrine.
They encountered the three remaining priests.
During the fight,
Raki
was distracted by Aisa's purse of Vearth and Kamakiri saved her but was wounded. The warriors retreated to a northeastern island in the Upper Yard. There,
Wyper
chastised Raki and threatened to throw the purse away, but Kamakiri stopped him.
The next morning Wyper poured out Aisa's purse and asked his fellow warriors if they were ready to step over their fallen comrades, and only those who answered yes could come with him.
As they proceeded through the forest, all of them, except Wyper, were caught in
Shura
's Ordeal of String. Wyper knocked out Shura with a
Reject Dial
.
Kamakiri warned Wyper about using the Reject Dial again, but Wyper asked how they could win without making sacrifices, and burned the
String Cloud
binding his comrades.
Braham
stated that they must split up because the island is enemy territory and that they cannot stay in a group or they will be captured again. After the conversation they started to move.
Kamakiri trying to hurt Enel.
As he moved with one ally Shandia, Enel showed up and struck the Shandia. Enel then ordered Kamakiri to hit him, giving him five minutes to do so, while sitting in one place, not moving.
He stabbed Enel in the head with his spear but was unable to injure Enel due to
his Logia fruit
and was struck by the conduction of Enel's electricity. Kamakiri quickly used his
Burn Blade
but it just continued through the tree. He was hit by Enel's 1 Million Volt Vari.
After he regained consciousness, Kamakiri told Raki to warn Wyper that Enel had left the God's Shrine and is too powerful. She departed and left Aisa's purse with Kamakiri.
After the war ended, he celebrated with the Skypieans.
