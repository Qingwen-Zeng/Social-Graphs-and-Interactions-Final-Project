Marco the Phoenix
is the former 1st division
commander
of the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
Once starting out as an
apprentice
on the crew,
he eventually came to be
Whitebeard
's closest confidant and right-hand man.
After his captain's death during the
Summit War of Marineford
, Marco assumed leadership of the Whitebeard Pirates until the crew's disbandment following the
Payback War
.
In the year since the disbandment, Marco worked as a
doctor
in Whitebeard's home village on
Sphinx
;
following the
Raid on Onigashima
, during which Marco acted as an ally to the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
, Marco permanently retired from piracy, returning to his duties as a doctor on Sphinx.
Marco is a major ally during the
Marineford
and
Wano Country Arcs
.
Appearance
[
]
Marco is a tall, lean, muscular, man with a rather sleepy look on his face and some stubble around his chin. He has short blond hair sticking in the top of his head similar to a
pineapple's
crown and he wears an open purple jacket and a light blue sash adorned with an elaborate golden-yellow belt around his waist. He has dark gray knee-long pants and black sandals, and on his left leg he wears what appears to be some sort of straw decoration, in a similar fashion to
Arlong
. While his chest was bare in his initial appearance, in his subsequent appearances he has the cross and crescent moon mustache symbol that resembles a black silhouette of Whitebeard's
Jolly Roger
tattooed on it.
Robin and Luffy believe that Marco's head looks like a pineapple.
Initially in the anime, Marco was given a generic crew member look of a black-haired man with pale skin and different clothes.
When he later became more formally recognized in the story, his appearance was changed to what is depicted in the manga, along with his light purple jacket, his black pants and his dark red tattoo.
Later, starting with
Opening 13 "One Day"
, he was given another color scheme. Once again, his jacket was recolored in a much brighter purple, his pants were made dark blue, his tattoo blue and his skin a little brighter.
Marco was a member of the Whitebeard Pirates twenty-two years ago as well. Even at the age of 23, his appearance, for the most part, resembles his present self.
As a kid, Marco's signature tuft of hair was curlier. He sported a vertically striped shirt, with black pants, and no shoes. As a teenager, his appearance was not much different.
After the timeskip, while working as a doctor on Whitebeard's home island, Marco wears a light button-up shirt as well as a pair of eyeglasses. He also has more facial hair.
During the raid on Onigashima, Marco wears his initial attire and retains his eyeglasses.

Personality
[
]
Marco is generally calm and level-headed in the face of adversity or challenge; the only strong emotional moments he has shown so far were directly related to Whitebeard's health (after he was stabbed in the torso by his own subordinate Squard and after his death).
When Ace and Whitebeard were killed, Marco and the rest of the Whitebeard Pirates were in tears.
In fact, seeing his captain, Whitebeard, get stabbed through the chest by a deceived
Squard
was enough for Marco to lose his usually unshakable cool-headedness that he immediately flew over to where they were to smash Squard's head against the
Moby Dick
's figurehead.
He also demonstrates himself to be acute at detecting power, able to quickly notice the presence of Red-Haired Shanks' Haōshoku Haki before anyone else aboard the Moby Dick
as well as the underlying potential of Monkey D. Luffy.
He clearly cares for his crew as he warned them to stay back from Shanks' Haki.
Having been a member of the
Whitebeard Pirates
for at least thirty years, Marco has an extremely high degree of experience with exposure and combat inside the treacherous
New World
. After Whitebeard's and Portgas D. Ace's deaths at Marineford, Marco took the position of commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, highlighting his level of intelligence and suitability in taking up a commanding position.
He appears to be somewhat playful, pretending to be hurt from Admiral
Kizaru
's attack with obvious sarcasm, though he can also quickly become serious.
Marco seems to appreciate raw talent, even if it comes from someone whom he had never met before (i.e., Luffy). Because of this and based on the fact that Luffy intercepted
Crocodile
's attack on Whitebeard, Marco immediately took a liking to him.
When he was an apprentice, he appeared to be a cheerful person. He was also encouraging as he cheered on Oden when he came close to passing Whitebeard's test to join the crew. He showed a playful side when he noticed Oden being close to Toki.
In general, Marco always conducts himself in a level-headed, polite and dignified manner. He is very kind and selfless, serving as the doctor on Sphinx to help and protect the villagers, and aiding the Straw Hats heavily several times for no other reason than supporting their goals.
Like some other characters, Marco has a very particular speech habit, which is a simple tic without meaning, ending his sentences with "-yoi"
(
～よい
?
)
: e.g. "arigatō-yoi"
(
ありがとうよい
?
, "thanks-yoi")
or "mattero-yoi"
(
待ってろよい
?
, "wait-yoi")
.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Marco standing next to Whitebeard during the battle of Marineford.
Being a division head of Whitebeard's crew, Marco had a very strong bond with
Whitebeard
. So strong was their bond, it seemed very similar to a captain and first mate relationship, much like the one of
Gol D. Roger
and
Silvers Rayleigh
. This can be indicated by Marco's position as 1st division commander. Also, during the
Summit War of Marineford
, Marco stood at Whitebeard's side almost the entire time in the early stages of the battle. Marco was also the first and only crewmate who rushed to Whitebeard's aid, after Whitebeard was stabbed by
Squard
and during his battle with
Akainu
. Later, Marco attempted to assist his captain in fighting
Blackbeard
, but was ultimately ordered to stand down. Marco, along with his crewmates, considered Whitebeard their "father" much in the same way the great pirate considered them his "children".
Marco also had a very strong bond with the other commanders as well as the rest of the crew. He and
Ace
seemed to have a close friendship, due to him explaining to Ace the bond between Whitebeard and his crew. Marco also trusted
Vista
enough to protect Luffy from
Mihawk
. By his own admission, Marco liked Oden and decided to go to Wano in order to avenge his death, despite wanting to protect
Sphinx
. Though
Izou
would later die in the raid to liberate Wano, Marco was at least satisfied with having Izou buried at
Ringo
within his homeland, knowing it was at least something he would have wanted.
Allies
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Having heard stories about
Luffy
from
Ace
, Marco was among the first people to recognize the Straw Hat captain in the midst of the battle in Marineford, despite not having encountered him prior. While no direct interaction occurred between the two, Marco, took an immediate liking to Luffy after the young pirate stopped
Crocodile
from attacking Whitebeard. Later, under Whitebeard's orders, he was delegated the task of ensuring that Luffy lived through the battle in Marineford. In the anime they had a short conversation after he saved Luffy from Aokiji, during which Luffy thanked him for saving him while Marco told him not to worry about it. Marco was also surprised at seeing Luffy's
Supreme King Haki
and when his captain told the rest of the crew to back up Luffy. After Ace's demise, he stopped
Akainu
from killing Luffy and urged the other Whitebeard Pirates to save Luffy, as Ace sacrificed his life for his.
Two years after the battle at Marineford, Luffy is shown to be thankful to Marco and the Whitebeard Pirates for protecting him from Akainu and wishes to meet them again one day in order to thank them for saving his life.
During the raid on Onigashima, he stopped the Big Mom Pirates from entering Wano to prevent them from interfering with the Straw Hats' decisive battle against the Beasts Pirates.
After both Kaidou and Big Mom's defeats, Luffy had the chance to thank Marco for saving his life in the Summit War.
Shanks
[
]
Marco talking with Shanks at the funeral of Whitebeard and Ace.
The two first met over 26 years ago, but they did not show any animosity towards each other back then.
Years later, Marco was hostile towards
Shanks
as he regarded him as an enemy. After Shanks knocked out some Whitebeard Pirates with his Haki, Marco insulted and scolded him for the damage he had done and even told him to shut up after the
Emperor
offered him to join his
crew
.
After the battle of Marineford, Marco apologized to Shanks for his previous behavior and genuinely thanked him for ensuring the funerals of both Whitebeard and Ace, finally acknowledging him as an ally.
Marco is also grateful to Shanks for burying Whitebeard near his hometown.
Marco took a ride with Shanks to reach
Sphinx
. When Shanks offers Marco to join his crew, he still refused.
Nekomamushi
[
]
Marco is well acquainted with the mink as they sailed on Whitebeard's ship together years ago. Nekomamushi knew exactly where to find Marco when he needed help. The pair caught up on recent events and
impending
threats
before Nekomamushi understood why he didn't want to leave the island. Marco was amused that the latter gave up on trying to recruit him so easily and asked to pass on a message to Luffy for him.
However, Marco changed his mind and entered Wano at the same time as Nekomamushi, prompting him to throw the message overboard.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Just like with their captain, Marco has taken a liking to the Straw Hat Pirates and has high expectations of them, choosing to support Luffy himself in becoming the Pirate King. During the raid on Onigashima, he helped them multiple times, such as helping Zoro get to the rooftop, buying Chopper time to cure Queen's Ice Oni virus and protecting them directly. He thinks very highly of them and told them they should be handling the strongest members of the Beast Pirates rather than waste their strength fighting the weaker members.
Jinbe
[
]
As one of Whitebeard's allies, Marco has a great camaraderie with Jinbe. When holding off Akainu from killing Luffy, Marco ordered Jinbe to take Luffy and escape. They once again joined forces to defeat Kaidou and Big Mom.
Enemies
[
]
Marshall D. Teach
[
]
Due to his role in the capture of
Ace
and the deaths of
Thatch
and
Edward Newgate
, Blackbeard is considered both an enemy and a traitor to the Whitebeard Pirates. He was shocked to see the power of his captain in the hands of Teach. During the timeskip, he and the rest of Whitebeard Pirates fought against the
Blackbeard Pirates
in the "
Payback War
", but lost and have since disappeared.
Even after the timeskip, Marco still despises Teach calling his actions deplorable and referring to him as ungrateful for taking advantage of the crew, despite everything they did for him.
World Government
[
]
Marco detests the World Government for its tyrannical policies, specifically the Heavenly Tribute as he notes many nations do not become affiliated with the political entity because they cannot pay the massive tax that is demanded by the
World Nobles
to obtain access to resources to protect civilians from crime and poverty.
Big Mom Pirates
[
]
Marco was an enemy of the
Big Mom Pirates
as his captain
Whitebeard
and
Charlotte Linlin
were peers who used to be crewmates within the
Rocks Pirates
and became adversaries when they became two of the
Four Emperors
. Despite this enmity, Big Mom appears to have a degree of respect for the
Whitebeard Pirates
as she questioned why they were helping members of the
Worst Generation
incite an uprising against
Kaidou
. She believes it is sad the remnants of the crew have lost their way in disturbing the balance of power in the
New World
. Marco in turn was willing to temporarily cooperate with
Charlotte Perospero
to defeat Kaidou but informs Big Mom they are surviving crewmates and can live as they want with their captain's death at
Marineford
. Marco then clashed against Big Mom, his phoenix flames proving capable of overpowering those of
Prometheus
. Big Mom grabbed Marco by the neck and ordered Perospero to kill him.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the former 1st division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, Marco held authority over the 1,600 crew members lower-ranked than him,
while enjoying particularly deep trust by
Whitebeard
as his "right hand".
A veteran of the crew, Marco had been part of it for at least thirty years, from the time of
Gol D. Roger
in his apprentice days.
Following Whitebeard's death, Marco assumed full leadership of the Whitebeard Pirates, their retreat from
Marineford
seemingly made under his command.
Later on, it was he who led the crew into the
Payback War
against the
Blackbeard Pirates
, until the crew's subsequent dissolution after the Blackbeard Pirates had defeated them.
Marco's status in the world is well-established, especially thanks to his massive
bounty
of
1,374,000,000.
After the
war at Marineford
, the
Five Elders
mentioned Marco (only him by name) with the remaining Whitebeard Pirates as one of the few groups left capable of defeating
Blackbeard
, who at that point was already held to be the chief candidate for succeeding Whitebeard as
Emperor
.
Other Emperors have also expressed their respect for Marco:
Shanks
on three separate occasions called on him to join his crew,
and
Big Mom
acknowledged Marco's strength by noting that his allegiance to the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
was unbecoming of a man of his caliber.
In battle, Marco is shown to be a very powerful combatant. At Marineford he, if only briefly, fought and held his own against each of the
three
Marine
admirals
, indicating his capabilities.
During the
Raid on Onigashima
, Marco had a brief, head-on clash with Big Mom on what seemed to be even terms, Marco appearing confident that he could keep the Emperor occupied. When abandoning their confrontation, Big Mom stated that she did not have enough
souls
to spare on Marco.
Later during the raid, Marco effectively held off and overpowered the two
All-Stars
King
and
Queen
,
Kaidou
's two strongest combatants with
bounties
over 1.3 billion, at once; however, Marco did state that fighting the two was difficult for him, and he sustained some light injuries amid the engagement
until eventually (if only temporarily) succumbing to exhaustion.
Marco is shown to have a strong will, remaining unfazed by the Emperor
Shanks
'
Supreme King Haki
as it was knocking his lower-ranked crewmates unconscious by the dozens.
Intelligence
[
]
Since childhood Marco has been very intelligent, supporting his crew with more than just battle power by providing knowledge and insight.
He had enough medical knowledge to act, assisted by his powers, as a
ship doctor
,
and while as a child he had a big passion for
navigation
, it is unknown how deep his knowledge runs in the present.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Marco launching a powerful knee strike.
Marco possesses immense physical strength. He could clash with marine admirals, blowing Kizaru and Aokiji large distances away using simple kicks (overpowering the former's one-armed guard and breaking the latter's
Ice Saber
in the act).
He easily toppled the
Queen Mama Chanter
, a gigantic ship, above the
Wano waterfall
entry in a single blow
and was later seen clashing head-on against Big Mom while the woman was wielding
Prometheus
, seemingly matching up to the Emperor's monstrous strength in the process, for a brief time; ultimately though, Big Mom was able to restrain Marco with a one-handed chokehold.
To King and Queen Marco has been repeatedly seen dealing powerful melee blows, his phoenix-legged kicks sending the All-Stars flying with great force and drawing blood.
In the anime, Marco was even able to send Queen in his massive
brachiosaurus
form flying a fair distance away with a one-legged kick.
Marco seems to prefer an off-the-ground, kick-emphasizing
style of attack
supplemented by his phoenix transformation. Aerially in his hybrid form, he has been seen delivering hard kicks (and even knee strikes) using his human legs or with his feet as phoenix talons, to deal slashing damage.
Marco is extremely fast and agile, especially while flying. He sprung instantaneously to protect Whitebeard from Kizaru's
Yasakani no Magatama
, interposing himself between his captain and the extremely quick-moving barrage of light bullets, and went on to intercept and clash with the fast-as-light admiral.
On top of his self-regeneration, Marco has exhibited great endurance. He was relatively fine (and able to run whilst healing) after having two of Kizaru's lasers pierce clean through his torso
and was later shot yet another two times while
Seastone
-shackled (thus with his powers nullified), but was still able to stand and function normally thereafter.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Phoenix
Marco transforms into a phoenix.
Marco ate the Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Phoenix,
a
Mythical Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a phoenix and a human-phoenix hybrid at will. He has a very well-developed mastery over his transformation, allowing him to alter select parts of his body as he needs to. This power is the source of his nickname "Marco the Phoenix".
As a Zoan, Marco enjoys a great boost to his physical abilities, gaining strength enough to restrain two
extremely
powerful
Ancient Zoan
users at once.
Furthermore, as a bird-type Zoan, Marco gains wings that allow him to fly in both his hybrid form and full phoenix form,
as well as taloned bird legs that he can use to perform powerful kicks or slash enemies with.
Marco can freely create his "Blue Flames of Resurrection" from any part of his body, even without actually transforming, and they always cover him while transformed.
These phoenix flames are stronger than normal fire
and possess tremendous healing properties; while shrouded in the flames, Marco can rapidly self-regenerate from nearly any physical damage he receives, like a phoenix being reborn. It is noted, or at least implied, that no matter what injury he is dealt, he can recover by flame (even injures that he suffered while his powers are
nullified
).
Such immense power of recovery allows Marco to ward off extremely potent attacks with little issue, like Kizaru's volley of light bullets
or even Akainu's
magma punch
.
Marco can also share his healing flames with others, allowing him to mend them as well, even multiple individuals at once. However, his flames are less effective on anyone other than himself.
Haki
[

Haki
Armament Haki
[

Marco is a highly skilled user of
Armament Haki
, shown by his ability to imbue his legs with it to physically contact and kick away
Logia
users such as Marine Admirals
Kizaru
and
Aokiji
.
He, alongside
Vista
, used this type of Haki against Admiral
Akainu
, although it had zero effect on him.
Observation Haki

occurred.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Marco was born on the
Grand Line
45 years ago.
Adventures With Kouzuki Oden
[
]
Marco 30 years ago
Thirty years ago, a 15-years-old Marco was already a member of the
Whitebeard Pirates
, as an
apprentice
on the
ship
.
He was seen among his crewmates when they arrived for the first time in
Wano Country
, after shipwrecking. Before getting to look for civilization for supplies, they encountered
Kouzuki Oden
, who asked
Newgate
to let him join their crew after a brief clash.
The Whitebeard Pirates later had a feast with Oden and his retainers. Marco told
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
of how vast the world is. Two weeks later, the Whitebeard Pirates tried to leave Wano without Oden. As they were leaving, the crew was surprised when Oden wrapped a chain around the Moby Dick's mast to get dragged with the ship. As Oden held onto the chain,
Izou
was also holding on to Oden and got dragged with him. Marco prepared to unwrap the chain, but Whitebeard ordered him to leave it be and pull Izou up to the Moby Dick. Oden then accepted Whitebeard's challenge of holding onto the chain for three days before he could be accepted into the crew. For the next three days, the crew watched how Oden withstood his ordeal. When Oden had an hour left to complete the challenge, Marco started cheering for him. After Oden was accepted into the crew, the Whitebeard Pirates had adventures with him as well as
Toki
, whom Oden helped, and Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, who had stowed away on the Moby Dick.
Sometime later, Marco noticed how close Oden had gotten with Toki. Two years after Oden joined, the crew celebrated the birth of Oden and Toki's son,
Kouzuki Momonosuke
. Around two years later after the birth of Oden and Toki's daughter,
Kouzuki Hiyori
, the Whitebeard Pirates arrived at an island and noticed a commotion that frightened the animals there.
The crew then clashed with the
Roger Pirates
present there for three days and nights before the skirmish ultimately became a gift exchange. Afterwards, the Whitebeard Pirates parted ways with Oden and his family.
The Whitebeard Pirates learned about Oden's death several years after it happened. However, they did not march into Wano to take revenge against Kaido and Orochi, knowing how powerful Kaido is.
Meeting with Shiki
[
]
Twenty-two years ago, Marco was present on Whitebeard's ship when
Shiki
visited the great pirate to inform him of his plans. At this point, he had already become one of Whitebeard's commanders.
Marco was also present on
Fish-Man Island
when Whitebeard claimed the island as his territory.
Ace's Arrival
[
]
Marco tells Ace to make a decision.
During the first few days that
Portgas D. Ace
came to spend on Whitebeard's ship, Marco tried to befriend him. Marco explained to Ace the kind of fatherly relationship Whitebeard had with his
crew members
. In fact, it was Marco who told Ace to leave the ship and start from scratch again or bear Whitebeard's mark as one of his sons.
At some point, Ace talked with Whitebeard about going to war with Kaidou to liberate Wano Country, but Whitebeard never agreed to this request. Marco stated that he would join Ace if Whitebeard gave his approval.
At another point three and a half years before the current storyline, Ace defeated a former
Warlord of the sea
, causing said warlord to be removed from his position. Six months later, Marco alongside Ace, Whitebeard, Teach, and Jinbe learned that a
replacement
for the warlord was decided.
Thatch's Murder
[
]
After the murder of
Thatch
at the hands of
Marshall D. Teach
, Ace decided to search for Blackbeard and make him pay for what he did. However, Whitebeard, who was feeling uneasy, told Ace not to go, something that Ace did not want to hear. Marco was one of the crew members who protested to Ace leaving the ship and going after Teach, but this was in vain.
Sky Island Saga
[
]
Jaya Arc
[
]
Marco was aboard Whitebeard's ship when
Rockstar
delivered a letter from
Shanks
. Rockstar boasted about his own notoriety, but Marco claimed to have never heard of him.
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
When Shanks came to visit Whitebeard personally, Marco and
Jozu
warned the younger and weaker crew members to stay back due to Shanks's
overwhelming presence
. He also told the members still standing afterward not to worry about their fallen comrades as they were just unconscious. Marco scolded Shanks for what he did to his subordinates, and Shanks recognized him as the 1st division commander and asked him if he would like to join the
Red Hair Pirates
, which Marco refused.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Marineford Arc
[
]
Marco battles Kizaru.
Marco showed up at
Marineford
with the rest of the Whitebeard Pirates and their subordinate crews from the
New World
. He stated that, including him, all of the Whitebeard Pirates were ready to battle anyone who had dared to lay a single finger on Ace. Later, when
Kizaru
tried to attack Whitebeard with an
array of laser beams
, Marco nullified the attack with his powerful
Devil Fruit transformation
. He then proceeded to assault Kizaru, successfully kicking him a great distance to the ground, though the
admiral
did not appear seriously injured by the act.
Sometime thereafter, Marco saw
Monkey D. Luffy
and his
Impel Down
team falling from the sky and came to the realization that Ace's brother, whom Ace had always talked about, had arrived. When he witnessed Luffy stopping
Crocodile
's attempt to kill Whitebeard on the grounds of Whitebeard being important to Ace, Marco concluded that, "Ace's little brother is not too shabby after all".
Just after Luffy had dashed off after informing Whitebeard that Ace would be executed ahead of schedule, Marco returned to the
Moby Dick
to report the same news. Whitebeard, after seeing some of Luffy's resolve to save Ace, told Marco that he would not forgive him if he were to let Luffy die, to which Marco (who appeared to have developed a similar opinion and liking towards Luffy) smiled and replied, "Roger."
Later, after Whitebeard manipulated
Buggy
into joining his cause temporarily, Marco remarked at how simple-minded Buggy was.
When he witnessed Luffy being attacked by
Dracule Mihawk
, he called out to 5th division commander
Vista
to go and help him out.
Afterwards, Marco found it odd when
Squard
appeared next to Whitebeard and was shocked when Whitebeard was stabbed by him.
He was the first one to reach the Moby Dick and to incapacitate Squard, but he was repelled by Squard's sword when Squard told Marco it was also his fault that he had been forced to attack Whitebeard.
Marco kicks Aokiji to save Luffy.
After Crocodile yelled at Whitebeard for being weak, Marco commented on how Whitebeard's health was getting worse, since Whitebeard should have been able to stop any attack aimed at him, even if he was caught off-guard.
After the whole ordeal was sorted out, he saw Squard crying and deeply regretting his actions, and suggested to him that he should redeem himself.
Thereafter, Marco's expression was solemn when he witnessed the Moby Dick being destroyed by
Akainu
's
meteoric magma attack
.
Later, as Ace was about to be executed, Marco was prepared to swoop in and save him, but noted that he was not needed after
Crocodile
saved Ace first. After Luffy was heavily injured by the admirals and was about to be finished off by
Aokiji
, Marco arrived and kicked Aokiji away a great distance.
Garp sends Marco crashing down.
Eventually, with (seemingly) only two
Marines
watching over Ace, Marco flew towards the execution platform telling Ace that he would soon save him. As he got closer, however,
Monkey D. Garp
intercepted him with a punch that sent him crashing to the ground. Marco, now in human form, looked up, frustrated and with a bruise on the left side of his chin.
Kizaru pierces a distracted Marco.
In the midst of battling Akainu suddenly seized Whitebeard's chest and Marco, in horror, realized what was happening just as Whitebeard coughed up a massive amount of blood. Marco thought to himself that this was what he was most afraid might happen and rushed towards his captain. However, he did not get very far before Kizaru shot him from behind with two simultaneous lasers, which clearly caused Marco pain, as he was in his human form.
Enduring the pain, Marco activated his regenerative powers and continued to run towards Whitebeard, only to have
Onigumo
seize him and place
Seastone
handcuffs on his right arm. Kizaru then took the opportunity to shoot Marco with yet two more laser bursts. Badly injured and unable to regenerate, Marco fell.
Later on, after Luffy unconsciously used his
Supreme King Haki
, the bloodied Marco showed surprise. By the time Squard entered the battlefield with the paddle boat
Little Oars Jr.
brought into the plaza, stating that Whitebeard and his subordinate crews should grab Ace and leave the enemy to him, Marco was back on his feet. He commented angrily on Squard's foolish way of redeeming himself and quickly ordered a nearby crewmate to remove his cuffs.
After Whitebeard declared that he would part ways with his sons and stay behind, Marco hesitated, reluctant, as a nearby crewmate urged him to go. Soon after, Marco was shocked by the sight of Ace taking Akainu's molten rock punch through the chest.
Then when Akainu tried to strike Ace a second time and finish him off, he was stopped by Jinbe; Marco saw this and, desperate now, ordered
Galdino
, who was dragged over to him, to remove his handcuffs immediately.
Marco and Vista attack Akainu
Akainu turned to launch another attack on Jinbe, and much to his annoyance was repelled by a simultaneous assault from Marco and Vista, who used
Haki
to drive the admiral away from the injured Jinbe, Ace, and Luffy. Marco, deep in regret, wondered how they could have allowed all this to happen. As Ace spoke his last words to Luffy, Marco joined the battle in order to keep the Marine forces away from Ace
and was seen crying after Ace had fallen dead.
Determined to finish off Luffy, who was incapacitated from shock caused by his grief and anguish, Akainu attacked once again; this time he was again intercepted by Marco alone, who shouted that Akainu would not touch Luffy. He ordered Jinbe to take Luffy and go. As Luffy was all that remained of Ace's will, Marco declared that they would protect him without fail, in place of Ace; if he too were to die, the Whitebeard Pirates would be put to shame.
When Whitebeard and Blackbeard confronted one another, Marco tried to fly to the other side of the giant crevice separating them to assist his captain, but was commanded to stay back by his captain, who said that he would kill Blackbeard as revenge for killing Thatch. When, consequently, Whitebeard was brutally killed by the
Blackbeard Pirates
ganging up on him, Marco mourned Whitebeard's death as Whitebeard left the crew under his care.
Marco then witnessed Blackbeard revealing himself to have stolen, somehow, the power of the
Gura Gura no Mi
from the dead Whitebeard, much to the commander's shock. Marco explained to a fellow crewmate that Blackbeard was no ordinary person, reasoning that Blackbeard's atypical body may have allowed him the aforementioned feat.
Marco then joined his fellow crewmates, with some unlikely help from Crocodile, as they prepared to face off against Akainu to defend Luffy and carry him on to the next era.
When
Koby
yelled for all the combatants to stop, Marco wondered why a Marine was trying to stop the fight.
Right after
Shanks
arrived at Marineford to stop the war, Marco was told by Shanks to withdraw peacefully from Marineford and avoid prolonging the battle any longer. Marco complied and later grieved with his crewmates over their losses.

in the New World. He thanked Shanks for ensuring that Whitebeard and Ace received proper burials.
During the Timeskip
[

Marco vs. Blackbeard.
One year after the war at Marineford, the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates, under Marco's guidance, fought against the Blackbeard Pirates in the "
Payback War
" in order to route an invading force, but suffered an overwhelming defeat.
Publicly, they are believed to have initiated the war to avenge their fallen comrades. They went into hiding and have not been seen since, which was what led Blackbeard to be officially recognized as Whitebeard's replacement among the Four Emperors.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After the Payback War, Marco went to Whitebeard's home village on
Sphinx
and started working there as a doctor. Eventually,
Nekomamushi
came there to find and try to recruit Marco into the
alliance
formed to take down
Kaidou
in
Wano Country
. In conversation with the
mink
, Marco mentioned
Whitebeard
's history with said village, as well as how he had heard about
Edward Weevil
attacking those connected to Whitebeard in search of a "fortune" that Marco noted did not exist. Because of the possibility that, in coming after him, Weevil would attack Sphinx as well, Marco voiced his decision to remain there to protect the village. Nonetheless, he asked Nekomamushi to pass on a message to
Luffy
:
that he would still come to Wano, only late.
Marco prevents the Big Mom Pirates from getting on Wano.
Days later in a surprising turn of events, Marco, who had decided to participate in the
Raid on Onigashima
after all, made his way to Wano at the same time as Nekomamushi and
Izou
(the latter of whom Marco knew the whereabouts of, hence them having made a pitstop to collect the
samurai
); this made Marco's message to Luffy unnecessary.
During the
Big Mom Pirates
' second attempt at entering the country, Marco flew to their
ship
and, as it finished climbing the waterfall, knocked it back down using
Hoo-in
.
After Nekomamushi's ship had succeeded in going up the waterfall, Marco and the
Guardians
proceeded to
Onigashima
.
Once they reached the rear side of the island, a flying Marco dropped off Nekomamushi and Izou, and they encountered some of the
Nine Red Scabbards
(including Izou's sister
Kikunojo
) alongside
Trafalgar Law
. As they rejoiced in their reunion, Marco said he would investigate a "strange shadow" he had spotted at sea earlier.
Marco clashes with Big Mom.
He subsequently happened across
Charlotte Perospero
,
who proposed that they work together given their mutual goal of bringing down Kaidou,
and together they arrived at Onigashima's entrance.
Eventually, the two encountered
Big Mom
, and Perospero bent to her will of upholding her alliance with Kaidou, with Marco noting that this spelt the end of their cooperation. When Big Mom asked why someone of Marco's status was helping some "
brats
", saying that the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates had lost their way, Marco simply asserted that, with Whitebeard's death, they were no longer bound to his will but left free to do as they pleased.
Marco then clashed against Big Mom, his phoenix flames proving capable of overpowering those of
Prometheus
. Big Mom grabbed Marco by the neck and ordered Perospero to kill him. However, before Perospero could fire his
candy
bow and arrow at him, he was attacked by the
Sulong
-transformed
Wanda
and
Carrot
, who recognized Marco as Nekomamushi's ally. Big Mom abruptly decided to call off her fight with Marco and headed back to Kaidou's castle, with Wanda telling Marco to go after her. Marco then noticed a nearby commotion.
Marco facing King and Queen.
Afterwards, Marco reached the Live Floor within the
Skull Dome
and offered to lend his assistance to the
Straw Hats
there.
Proceeding to envelop the
Ice Oni
-infected
Chopper
with his flames to defrost him, Marco then started flying over and spreading his flames to all the infected present in the banquet hall, in order to slow the virus' freezing effects in those afflicted by raising their body heat. Once he had done so, Marco offered
Zoro
and the other Straw Hats present to fly them to the Skull Dome's roof.
As the
Beasts Pirates
attacked Marco, he told
Brook
and
Robin
to run into the castle. He then transformed into a phoenix and began carrying Zoro toward the roof. However, the All-Stars
King
and
Queen
made an attempt to stop their advancement upward, with Queen shooting at Marco.
Despite the All-Stars' efforts, however, Marco managed to hold them back with his phoenix wings and successfully threw Zoro up to the roof through the hole in it.

Marco then began fighting King and, while being assaulted by him, heard
Sanji
's cry for help broadcasted throughout Onigashima, which he was amused by.
Sometime after, Marco intercepted Queen's attempt at hitting
Hyougoro
with a
laser shot from his mouth
, striking and injuring the All-Star with
Hoo-in
. Marco reminded Queen that, since they were fighting, Queen ought to not even think of about the samurai until he had finished Marco off. Marco then flew toward Queen, dodging another laser, as King suddenly jumped in and cut off Marco's left phoenix wing. Marco, unfazed, simply reshaped the wing's feathery remains into a large fireball that, as his
Bluebird
attack, he sent toward King, sending him violently crashing into a nearby building. Before King could properly guard himself, Marco followed up with a flying knee strike, causing an explosion where King had landed. As Queen angrily approached, he was suddenly hit by yet another attack from Marco,
Ongle
: a taloned kick that sent him flying as well. Marco noted how holding off two men with
bounties
over a billion was difficult, telling Chopper to hurry up.
After Chopper had successfully created a
counter-virus
neutralizing Queen's Ice Oni, and an enraged Queen was distracted by his subordinates turning on him for his treating them expendable, Marco took the chance to grab hold of Queen's neck, restraining him to allow Chopper to slap Queen in his
Monster Point
form. As Chopper exclaimed that he was not a "tanuki", Marco inwardly apologized for having called him such,
before he and Chopper continued engaging Queen.
A little thereafter, Marco reacted with concern about the broadcasted announcement that Luffy, the highest bounty head on the alliance's side, had been defeated by Kaidou.
When Sanji arrived in time to save Chopper from Queen, declaring how not all hope was lost, Marco commented how this was why he liked their crew.
A while later, Marco was seen sitting still on the ground, having seemingly reached the limit of his stamina. This gave King and Queen the opportunity to wipe out significant portions of the enemy alliance without distraction, including the turncoat Beasts Pirates. When King confronted a bandaged-up Zoro, who was being carried away by samurai, the All-Star tried attacking him with a
flaming punch
, but just then Marco flew in to block it with his
Fujiazami
technique. Marco remarked that he had long ago heard about a
certain race
living atop the
Red Line
that could burst into flames, which King left uncommented. As King and Queen then prepared to attack Marco and take him out for good, Marco stated with a smile that he had done his part and would now allow the star players to take the stage; right then, a recovered Zoro and Sanji jumped in, launching an attack on King and Queen respectively.
After Zoro and Sanji's attack, Marco watched King and Queen rise back up. Intrigued, he remembered something once told him by Whitebeard: about how long before
Mary Geoise
existed, there had been a land of gods on top of the Red Line. While absorbed in these thoughts, some Beasts Pirates shot at him. Izou arrived in time, grabbed hold of Marco to dodge the gunfire, and then ran away with Marco under his arm. Marco jokingly noted how had waited to be saved by him, then asked Izou if he believed in gods, prompting Izou to say that Marco was sounding just like a drunk Whitebeard.
A while later, Marco and Izou were still on the Live Stage, reacting shocked at the sight of Queen separating his brachiosaurus neck and tail from the rest of his body to attack Sanji.
Afterwards, Marco in his full phoenix form began carrying Izou over the Live Stage and towards Kaidou's burning castle, where they had heard was some kind of large
fire apparition
.
Sometime later, Marco was seen again in the bath of the Skull Dome's Forehead Floor, having met up with
Nami
and having just finished healing the two beasts
Komachiyo
and
Hihimaru
for
Tama
. Marco remarked that it was important for them to keep their wits about them with how fast things were developing, stating that as of that moment, Onigashima was the most dangerous island in the world.
It was soon thereafter that Kaidou came back down from the Skull Dome's rooftop, declaring his victory over Luffy. When the Emperor attempted to hit Nami with his
Bolo Breath
, Marco jumped in using
Fujiazami
to shield her from the attack, at the same time declaring to his comrades that they ought not to lose their composure so long as not everything was over.
Sure enough, Marco was afterwards among the few people on the Live Floor that
sensed
how Luffy was still conscious, telling Nami and Tama as much.
Luffy then resumed his battle with Kaidou, during which Marco witnessed Luffy's
giant head
.
Not long after, the Straw Hat successfully defeated Kaidou, an event that coincided with the island of Onigashima finally landing after Kaidou had made it float all the way next to the Flower Capital. Marco was seen standing near Nami and Tama, watching them celebrate their alliance's victory against the Beasts Pirates with a smile on his face.

A week following the raid on Onigashima, Marco was seen at the
Northern Cemetery of Ringo
with
Kin'emon
,
Kawamatsu
, and
Onimaru
. When Kin'emon asked Marco if he was fine with Izou, who had lost his life in the raid, being buried in Ringo, Marco responded that it was only right for Izou to have his home country become his final resting place. Marco solemnly commented that he was once again left with one of his comrades dead, with Kin'emon and Kawamatsu noting that they knew the feeling.
Before he departed Wano, he visited Luffy, Jinbe, Zoro and Sanji who were in a discussion with Yamato, and bid them farewell since he was leaving with the
Red Hair Pirates
. After receiving thanks from Luffy, Marco told them that they would now carry the new age on their shoulder.

As the Red Force neared Sphinx, Marco thanked the Red Hair Pirates for picking him up, though he cheerfully shut down Shanks' attempts at recruiting him, saying he was done babysitting bigger pirate groups, and felt he was getting too old for such affairs. So, Marco effectively retired from a life of piracy, and then flew off towards Sphinx.
Miss Buckin informs Marco of Weavil's predicament.
When he reached the Island, he encountered the villagers that told him that the Marines invaded during his absence, but they were driven away by
Edward Weevil
. Just then a frantic
Miss Buckin
revealed that Weevil was defeated and arrested by Admiral
Ryokugyu
. While he was grateful for Weevil's help, Buckin could tell from Marco's tone he was still doubtful that the former warlord was Whitebeard's biological son so she told him she knew someone who could prove it;
Dr. Vegapunk
.
Later as he listened to
Vegapunk
's worldwide broadcast, Marco recalled what Whitebeard said about the Lunarians and the Red Line when the scientist mentioned rare
races
that were persecuted.

Manga and Anime Differences
[
]
In the anime when Marco was first shown, his design was replaced with a more generic one of a dark-haired crewmember
(whereas the manga correctly showed him having light-colored hair). This is a common mistake that occurs in transferring a scene from manga to anime and has been witnessed in
One Piece
before, in particular when characters are first shown
without a formal introduction
.
In the anime, in the flashback showing the final battle between the Whitebeard and
Roger Pirates
, a teenaged Marco was shown clashing with
Silvers Rayleigh
, the latter able to stop Marco's phoenix kick using a single
Haki
-imbued finger.
