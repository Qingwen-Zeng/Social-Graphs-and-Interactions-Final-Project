"Great Staff Officer" Tsuru
is an extremely famous and powerful
Marine
Vice Admiral
,
as well as the grandmother of
Kujaku
.
Tsuru is one of the major figures, along with
Kong
,
Sengoku
,
Shiki
,
Silvers Rayleigh
,
Monkey D. Garp
and
Whitebeard
, from the times when
Gol D. Roger
, the "Pirate King", was still alive.
Appearance
[
]
Tsuru is a tall, thin, and elderly woman with gray hair tied in a bun. Her attire appears to be less formal than the other high-ranking officers', consisting of an untucked shirt, with the sleeves rolled up and a tie around her neck, and calves-long pants, which makes her somewhat resemble the animal of her name, the
crane
. She sports earrings made of beads, and wears two bracelets on her right wrist. The epaulets on her Marine coat are golden for the outer epaulets and purple with two white dots for the inner epaulets.
During the time of the Battle of Edd War, they were the standard blue.
Twenty-seven years ago, at age 49, her skin was already wrinkled despite only being middle-aged.
In her youth, she was quite beautiful and had dark blue hair tied up in a loose ponytail, with side bangs that framed both sides of her face. She wore a standard Marine uniform with a rifle strapped to her back.
Personality
[
]
She is a veteran Marine who is not without wisdom for her age. She seems extremely knowledgeable; she knew
Donquixote Doflamingo
set the
Marines
to fight each other in the Marine and
Warlord
meeting when all others thought the two were simply messing around, and knew who
Laffitte
was on sight. She is not above telling off the younger marines that show concern for her well-being when she steps up to fight the incoming pirates at Marine HQ. She then justifies herself being on the front line with the other Vice Admirals by stating there is no longer a safe place left in the world for her to run to anyway. According to Garp, she is an empathetic woman although she does not show this disposition very often.
Tsuru follows "Cleansing Justice"
(
清らかなる正義
,
Kiyorakanaru Seigi

)
.
Relationships
[
]
Marines
[
]
Gion
[
]
Tsuru and
Gion
have a close relationship due to Tsuru treating Gion as if she is her little sister.
Sengoku
[
]
Sengoku
appears to be well-acquainted with Vice Admiral Tsuru as well. 13 years ago, in the
North Blue
, she worked under Sengoku's orders to stop the Donquixote Pirates. Despite being outranked by him, Tsuru still had no problem calling him a fool for providing her wrong intel.
Nowadays, Tsuru appears to be annoyed with Sengoku's new cheerful disposition and lack of responsibility.
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
Tsuru is well acquainted with
Garp
, having known him for a long time. Before the Summit War of Marineford occurred, she told him that he had done nothing wrong about Ace, which Garp replied with laughter, saying that she was supposed to be sympathetic towards him during this situation.
Garp and Sengoku are the only ones that call her Tsuru-chan while the others call her either Vice Admiral Tsuru or Tsuru-san.
Tsuru was shown shocked at the news that Garp was going to Hachinosu with
SWORD
(including Tsuru's granddaughter,
Kujaku
) to rescue Koby.
Bluegrass
[
]
Tsuru and
Bluegrass
appear to have a very close relationship, with Tsuru considering Bluegrass like an older sister.
Enemies
[
]
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
Tsuru has a history with the
Donquixote Pirates
, having pursued them on numerous occasions before the crew's captain,
Donquixote Doflamingo
, became a
Warlord of the Sea
. When Doflamingo causes a scene at a meeting of Warlords in
Mary Geoise
, she calmly tells Doflamingo to "be a good boy" and stand down, maintaining an authoritative tone in his presence.
After Doflamingo and his crew had been defeated and arrested, Tsuru looked after Doflamingo until they arrived at Impel Down.
Doflamingo seems to hold some respect for her, as he addresses her as "O-Tsuru-san"
(
おつるさん
?
)
, and Tsuru's retorts have twice caused Doflamingo to admit that he cannot get the best of her.
Meanwhile, Tsuru sees some value in Doflamingo's insight into the underworld and asked for his opinion on the future of the pirating world after his defeat.
However, she denied Doflamingo's request for access to newspapers in Impel Down.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a veteran
Vice Admiral
from the same generation of Marines as Garp and Sengoku,
Tsuru is one of the most prominent Marines in the world. She is well-renowned and recognized as a legendary figure by the likes of
Franky
and
Usopp
.
Even in her elderly age of 63, Tsuru was strong enough to strike intense fear into
Doflamingo
, who even before becoming a
Warlord of the Sea
was an extremely powerful pirate, as he was quick to flee during her many pursuits of the
Donquixote Pirates
throughout the
North Blue
,
and despite his initial plans to reclaim Law from the Marines's custody to use his
powers
to immortalized himself, Doflamingo quickly changed this plan upon seeing her battleship off the coast of
Minion Island
.
Several years later, when Doflamingo lost his title as a Warlord, he still showed respect for her, a stark contrast to his usual disrespect to other high-ranking Marines.
Alongside Sengoku and
Fujitora
, she was part of Doflamingo's Marine escort who fought against
Jack
, a right-hand man of
Emperor
Kaidou
.
Tactical Skills
[
]
Tsuru has vast knowledge of criminals from various parts of the world, being able to instantly recognize
Laffitte
and explain his history to Sengoku. She is present at important meetings concerning the
Three Great Powers
, such as the meeting to determine
Crocodile
's successor in the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
.
Tsuru is said to be second to none in experience and knowledge and acted as a renowned
staff officer
for Fleet Admiral Sengoku before his retirement.

Further information:
Woshu Woshu no Mi
Tsuru's laundry power.
Tsuru ate the Woshu Woshu no Mi,
a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to literally "wash and hang out to dry" people and objects as if they were clothes, turning them into flat and malleable like fabric.
This disables the opponents by rendering them unable to move. This power can also "clean" a limited amount of evil off the victims, which is considered a dangerous ability against pirates.

History
[

Past
[
]
Tsuru joined the
Marines
56 years ago along with
Sengoku
and
Monkey D. Garp
.
27 years ago, Tsuru was walking with fellow vice admirals Garp,
Jaguar D. Saul
,
Kuzan
, and
Sakazuki
. Garp asked her if he could borrow a ship, but she refused because he always broke them.
At some point prior in her life, Tsuru started a family and had a granddaughter named
Kujaku
26 years ago, who would go on to follow in her footsteps and become a
Marine Rear Admiral
.
Tsuru's battleship in pursuit of the Donquixote Pirates.
Thirteen years ago, Tsuru was stationed in the
North Blue
, where she continuously pursued the
Donquixote Pirates
at the time.
Donquixote Doflamingo
noted that her chases stopped after
Rosinante
had left the crew, which led Doflamingo to suspect that his younger brother was giving away his crew's location to the Marines.
Three days before the scheduled exchange between the Marines and
Diez Barrels
for the
Ope Ope no Mi
, she was stationed at
Swallow Island
following Rosinante's intel that Doflamingo and his crew would be there, unaware that they actually had gone to
Minion Island
instead. She was then contacted and informed by the Marines scouting Minion Island about the fire at Barrels' hideout and ordered them to investigate the coast while avoiding being spotted.
As Doflamingo and his crew were leaving the island, Tsuru's ship fired at them, forcing them to flee.

and told him to stop. When
Laffitte
intruded into the meeting, Tsuru identified him and explained his background to
Sengoku
.
Summit War Saga

Tsuru with Garp at Marineford.
Tsuru was present at
Marineford
in preparation for war against
Whitebeard
. Tsuru said some comforting words to
Garp
concerning the upcoming execution of
Portgas D. Ace
but he replied with laughter, stating that she should be shown sympathy rather than comforting him. Upon Whitebeard's arrival, she commented on the illogicality of his position
and joined the other vice admirals when his division commanders began their attack. Although Vice Admiral
Yamakaji
expressed concern for her safety, Tsuru stayed on the front lines, stating that there was no safe place to hide.
Tsuru observed that
Little Oars Jr.
was bigger than any
giant
.
After having dealt with several pirates using her powers, Tsuru received Sengoku's order to prepare for the next part of the Marines' plan,
so she returned to the plaza behind the Encircling Wall.
After

. After a conversation concerning Doflamingo's crew, Sengoku offered Tsuru some okaki.
Three days after Doflamingo's downfall, Tsuru and Sengoku arrived at
Dressrosa
and met up with Admiral
Fujitora
. Tsuru asked Fujitora why he did not capture
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Trafalgar Law
. The admiral explained that he made his decision based on the roll of a dice and that the pirates had been lucky for two days in a row. Fujitora then gave Tsuru his dice and declared that if it rolled on any number other than one, he would go after the pirates himself.
Tsuru speaks to the imprisoned Doflamingo.
After Luffy and his group had escaped, the Marines left Dressrosa while escorting Doflamingo. While guarding Doflamingo's cell, Tsuru reminded Doflamingo of the reality that he lost and then listened to his comment about how the war for the title of Pirate King will begin.

Jack
of the
Beasts Pirates
, who sought to rescue Doflamingo. Two of the Marines' four ships were sunk but they managed to defeat him.

Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
Weeks later at
New Marineford
, Tsuru and Sengoku were reading up on the news about
T Bone
having been murdered by an unknown assassin who was motivated by the money rewarded by the
Cross Guild
for eliminating Marines, thanks to their established bounty system on Marines. Both were concerned with the threat the Marines were now facing from both pirates and common people. Hina then informed them that Garp,
Kujaku
, and
SWORD
had headed to
Hachinosu
to rescue
Koby
, which shocked both Tsuru and Sengoku.
Later during the
Egghead Incident
, Tsuru and Sengoku listened to
Vegapunk
's broadcast while onboard her battleship.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In her first appearance in the anime, Tsuru's dialogue with
Donquixote Doflamingo
,
Laffitte
and
Sengoku
is cut and she does not say anything. Instead,
Mozambia
, who was
controlled
by Doflamingo, is the one who tells Doflamingo to stop and the one who identifies Laffitte.
Also, while appearing in a flashback thirteen years ago, her main crew was not seen in the manga, but in the anime, it was seen to be comprised entirely of female Marines.
Due to the fact that Tsuru's full body was not visible in her early appearances in the manga, the anime misjudged her height and proportions, initially depicting her with much shorter legs than intended. This was fixed when she appeared in the
Dressrosa Arc
.
