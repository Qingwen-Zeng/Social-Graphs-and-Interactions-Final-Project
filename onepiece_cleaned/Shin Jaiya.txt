Jaiya and her grandmother ran from the Birdcage as
Donquixote Doflamingo
began closing it. Suddenly, Detamaruka fell and was unable to get back up. She told Jaiya to leave her and keep going, but Jaiya refused. They then listened to their former king,
Riku Doldo III
, encouraging everyone to keep staying alive and that there was hope, which caused Detamaruka to get back up. As she watched her grandmother ran at a very fast pace, Jaiya cried tears of joy.
