Quick Answers
What led to Trafalgar Law's position as one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea being revoked?
Trafalgar Law had his position revoked due to allying with the Straw Hat Pirates. While it is acceptable for Warlords to have subordinates, with these subordinates gaining the same immunity from the law so long as their masters maintain Warlord status, the World Government does not permit Warlords to collaborate with other criminals as equals. Law declared to Admiral Fujitora on Green Bit that he and Luffy were in an alliance, causing Fujitora to immediately revoke his Warlord status.

What is the backstory of Trafalgar Law's alliance with the Straw Hat Pirates?
Trafalgar D. Water Law, the captain of the Heart Pirates, first met the Straw Hat Pirates on Sabaody Archipelago. They crossed paths again on Punk Hazard, where Law proposed an alliance with Luffy to take down the Emperor Kaidou, a common enemy. Despite their different views on alliances, they maintain a positive relationship. Law tolerates Luffy's antics, and together they've embarked on numerous adventures, including the mission to defeat and capture Caesar, and the plan to challenge the emperor by blackmailing Donquixote Doflamingo.

What is the origin of Trafalgar Law's pirate crew, the Heart Pirates?
The Heart Pirates, led by Trafalgar D. Water Law, are an infamous rookie pirate crew from the North Blue. They first made their appearance around the same time as the Straw Hat Pirates in Sabaody Archipelago. The name 'Heart Pirates' has a few possible origins. It is likely a nod to Corazon, the man who saved Law. The crew's emblem, a smile on the jolly roger, is likely a nod to Law's future aspirations. They were known for their alliance with the Straw Hat Pirates, Kozuki Family, and Mink Tribe, aiming to take down Donquixote Doflamingo and Kaidou.

Appearance
Law is a slim young man with tan skin and a very tall statue. He has faint shadows right under his yellow eyes (grey in the anime), and his face is usually seen with a smirk. He wears a northern-style fur hat, which is white and has a spotted pattern along the bottom and the bill. He has very short dark hair, a majority of which is obscured by his hat, save for his sideburns and a small goatee.
His hair color is depicted as black in both the anime and manga, though sometimes the manga depicts it as blue mistakenly.
He has many tribal-style tattoos on his arms; on both of his hands are letters spelled as
D E A T H
tattooed in black on each of the back of his fingers. Originally in the
manga
, his right hand was not tattooed
while his left thumb had the letter
A
missing.
Later on, all of his fingers were tattooed completely with all five letters.
He also has a black cross on the back of both of his hands.
On his chest, he has a tribal-style heart tattoo with his Jolly Roger on it. He has a simpler heart tattoo on his shoulders and his Jolly Roger tattooed on his back.
Before the Timeskip
He is seen wearing a yellow hoodie, with black sleeves and a black hood. The hoodie has his
Jolly Roger
printed on the front of the chest area in dark ink, and he keeps the sleeves rolled up. Law wears a northern-style fur hat that has a rim running all around it. It is white and has a black dot pattern along the rim and lower areas of the hat. Law also sports a pair of jeans with odd dots on both the knee and ankle areas, similar to the ones on his hat, but darker in color. He sports a pair of dark, pointed shoes. He has a pair of small earrings on each ear.
In
SBS Volume 64
, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Law is shown with his fur hat and his faint shadows right under his eyes but wore the uniform for the medical academy he was attending: a blue lab coat with a red tie, dark blue shorts, and green shoes. He was also holding a scalpel on his right hand and a frog on his left hand, since he was already in training to become a surgeon with his father being his teacher.
After escaping
Flevance
, Law lost his tie and lab coat, his shirt underneath became more raggedy, and his shorts had white spots on them. Because of his heritage, he inherited the
Amber Lead Syndrome
that accumulated throughout the generations of Flevance, which left his skin white and pallid until he obtained his cure.
After the Timeskip
In Oda's depiction of the Supernovas post-timeskip, he seems to have lost the fur rim of his hat, and replaced it with a thick bill, turning it into a rather spherical hat resembling a Wool Skipper. His goatee has become somewhat scruffier, and his right hand now also has the fingers tattooed. He now wears a yellow t-shirt similar in appearance to his old hoodie. He wears a black hoodie over the t-shirt, which features his Jolly Roger on the chest area in yellowish-orange ink. The sleeves of the hoodie are no longer rolled up, and it now has a fluffy fur collar.
During the
Punk Hazard Arc
, Law wears a long black coat with his crew's Jolly Roger along the hem and on the sleeve.
While sailing to Dressrosa with the Straw Hats, Law wears a blue feather-collared sweater with his jolly roger on the front.
During the
Dressrosa Arc
, he wears an open black coat with a hood that features the word
Corazon
on the back.
During his second confrontation with Doflamingo, Law's right arm was cut off. It is later
reattached
by
Leo
and
healed
by
Mansherry
.
During the
Zou Arc
, Law changed into a dark, short-sleeved shirt with a light-colored heart pattern on the lower left side. He also bears stitch marks on his right arm after it was reattached by Leo.
During the
Wano Country Arc
, Law wears a black and white yukata with his two Jolly Roger, an orange sash, a brown jittoku with yellow five-petal flower patterns and spots, and zōri.
He briefly wears a tengai to hide his identity from his enemies such as Hawkins.
During the Raid on
Onigashima
, Law wears a yellow dress shirt with rolled-up sleeves and a blue captain's cloak with a fluffy fur collar.
Afterward, Law switches the yellow shirt for a white tank top but keeps the coat.
