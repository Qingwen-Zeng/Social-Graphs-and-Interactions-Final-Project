Appearance
[
]
Gaban is a tall, well-built man with long black hair. His hair is tied in a bushy ponytail in the back, while two thin strands of hair fall over his face. He is always seen wearing a pair of round, black sunglasses.
27 years ago, he wore a long-sleeved blue shirt with white stripes on each sleeve, which was only held closed at the middle with one button.
In the anime, he was initially depicted in this outfit with lighter colored hair, silver sunglasses and a purple shirt with a yellow stripe on the collar and down each arm.
26 years ago, he initially wore a yellow t-shirt with two orange blotch-like patterns on the right side, blue pants, and a purple sash. He then wore a purple shirt, orange pants and a pale-yellow sash.
Personality
[
]
Gaban can be very quick to get to the point, as he proposed stopping the rampaging
Kouzuki Oden
early on before the samurai could cause more damage to the crew.
He was also the first to voice the crew's dissatisfaction towards Oden after the latter joined the Roger Pirates. Gaban does not seem to care for small talk, cutting
Neptune
off when he started talking about
Shyarly
's popularity across
Fish-Man Island
.
As a long-time member of the Roger Pirates, he understands Roger better than most and knows it is pointless to convince him to run from an enemy.
Gaban seems to hold his captain to a high standard and tried to stop him from bowing his head to
Whitebeard
.
Abilities and Powers

Gaban appears to have been a prominent figure in terms of strength and authority, as he was shown leading the charge alongside
Rayleigh
during the crew's last battle with the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
In the anime, Gaban was shown to be strong enough to clash on even terms with soon-to-be crewmate
Kouzuki Oden
, one of the strongest-ever
samurai
from
Wano
.
Having arrived at
Laugh Tale
along with the rest of the Roger Pirates, Gaban also knows the truth about the
Void Century
. However, as stated by Rayleigh, it is likely that he and the rest of the crew could having interpreted that information differently by lacking the archaeological knowledge of scholars of
Ohara
's caliber.
Weapons
[
]
Gaban wields a pair of axes as his main weapon. The axes are single bit, with a large axe head and a plain handle.

Biography
[
]
38 years ago, Scopper Gaban was already a member of the
Roger Pirates
and was present during the
God Valley Incident
alongside his captain
Gol D. Roger
and fellow subordinate
Silvers Rayleigh
excitedly ready to engage in combat.
After leaving God Valley the Roger pirates were partying over the treasures which they stole when they discovered a
baby
inside one of the treasure chests.
Around 27 years ago, Gaban and the Roger Pirates took part in a battle against an unnamed enemy ship, happily fighting off the enemies.
Gaban was present with the rest of the
Roger Pirates
in the sea known as
Edd War
, where they were confronted by
Shiki
, the captain of the
Golden Lion Pirates
. Shiki demanded to form an alliance with the Roger Pirates in hopes of taking over the world and if they did not agree, Shiki would destroy them with his armada. While this event occurred, Gaban tried his best to calm down
Buggy
, who was hoping to surrender to Shiki, but in the end, Roger refused the alliance thus resulting in an epic battle where the entire crew, including Gaban fought it out. Luckily, fate was on the Roger Pirates' side as during the battle, a massive storm formed and sunk half of Shiki's armada, resulting in the Roger Pirates' victory. This event was forever known as the
Battle of Edd War
.
Around 26 years ago, the Roger Pirates were causing a ruckus on an island. After defeating a group of
Marines
, they learned that the
Whitebeard Pirates
had docked on the other side of the island.
The Roger Pirates were then confronted by
Kouzuki Oden
. Gaban and
Silvers Rayleigh
prepared to fight him, but
Gol D. Roger
charged in and blew Oden away with a single slash. The Roger Pirates clashed with the Whitebeard Pirates for three days and three nights before the skirmish turned into a gift exchange. The Roger Pirates were later joined by Oden and his family as well as
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
. At some point, the Roger Pirates visited
Skypiea
.
After leaving Skypiea, the crew's voyage took them to
Water 7
,
Tequila Wolf
,
Sabaody Archipelago
, and
Fish-Man Island
. Sometime later, they left
Toki
,
Momonosuke
,
Hiyori
, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi in
Wano Country
. Sometime after the visit to
Zou
, the Roger Pirates finally reached
Laugh Tale
. When the crew discovered
Joy Boy
's treasure, they responded with a burst of laughter.
Sometime after Roger became Pirate King, Roger decided to disband the crew. Roger was the first to leave and the crew tearfully parted ways with him. They later returned Oden to Wano Country, and they tearfully bid farewell to him as well.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Gaban debuts in the manga during
Buggy
's flashback in
Chapter 19
, but does not appear in the anime adaptation of the chapter.
In the manga, Gaban's outfit inexplicably changes in the span of a few pages during the conflict with the
Whitebeard Pirates
. This is corrected in the anime, where he maintains the same outfit until the story skips four days to the end of the conflict.
However, this correction was seemingly made at the last minute, because the preview in the previous episode still showed him in a different outfit.

Gaban's outfit in the episode itself.
While the manga did not show any details of the battle with the Whitebeard Pirates, the anime depicts Gaban clashing with
Kouzuki Oden
. Later, the anime expands on the events at
Mock Town
, showing Gaban enter the town with Shanks and Buggy to purchase supplies. The trio then notice Oden causing a ruckus and chase after him to stop him from stealing food from ordinary citizens. However, after being attacked by a group of thugs and realizing the town is lawless, Gaban allows Oden to run wild.
