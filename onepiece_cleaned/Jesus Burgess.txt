Appearance
[
]
Jesus Burgess is an unusually large, tall, broad, broad-chested, broad shouldered, tan-skinned, muscular man, with a broad upper body and a thin lower body in comparison. He has curly violet hair reaching down to his shoulders and always wears a dark brown mask with orange decorations on it, which covers the upper part of his face but reveals his eyes and his nose. He appears to be based on Luchador wrestlers based on his name and the face mask of Mexican origin.
He wears a sleeveless black shirt and a pair of white pants with ruffles coming from the base then reaching up to his knees; he also wears black bands tied around both elbows. Burgess also appears to be always wearing a championship belt, a belt which wrestlers only obtain from winning many matches or to show that they are extremely skilled in wrestling. It is unknown if Burgess obtained this belt from his mastery in wrestling or if it's just there for his wrestler appearance.
During the timeskip, Burgess has grown a beard and become even more muscular. His hair has also turned a lighter shade than what it was two years ago. While at the
Corrida Colosseum
, Burgess dons the traditional gladiator attire of sandals and a loincloth, as well as his trademark belt. In addition, his right arm is armored, with his shoulder being covered by a plate pauldron, all held in place by a harness across his chest. He also wears a pair of black gloves. When he first entered the Colosseum as Mr. Store, he was wearing a light green paper bag mask which has eyeholes in it and the name "Store" which is colored aqua-blue and Happy written in black upside-down on the forehead.
His regular outfit after the timeskip is mostly the same as two years ago. However, he now wears a vertically striped black and white sleeveless shirt that has the same orange symbol as his luchador mask, and he now wears a pair of brown gloves. In Dressrosa, he also carries a green bag which has swirly patterns on it.
During the
Egghead Arc
, he now wears a golden metal plating over the right side of his skull and jaw due to the injuries he received from fighting Sabo. He also wears his original outfit and reduced his beard to a chin curtain for the metal plating on his face.
Personality
[
]
Burgess is brutish and ogre-like, and is also very loud and overbearing. He seems to be overconfident, as he climbed buildings and challenged random people in
Jaya
, proclaiming himself as the Champion. He also appears to have an intense love of combat, wanting to test his skills out on anyone he finds. He especially enjoys strong opponents, as shown when he found out that Monkey D. Luffy was fighting at the Corrida Colosseum. Despite, or perhaps because of his profound love for combat, Burgess also appears to be a sore loser, unable to accept defeat even when he is critically injured. He is also willing to use whatever dirty and underhanded tactics he can should he or his allies be unable to win in a fair fight, as evidenced by how he joined the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates in their nine-on-one assault against Whitebeard or tried to goad Sabo into approaching him by taunting him about Ace's last request and him not being there to save his brother so he could stab the revolutionary with a hidden knife.
He has a much more serious nature than his captain, as he scolded
Blackbeard
for laughing when they lost the
Straw Hat Pirates
. However, he seems to have become quite laid-back after the time-skip shown when meeting Monkey D. Luffy in the Corrida Colosseum hallways and letting his captain talk to him.
Late into the Dressrosa Arc, Burgess also displayed a ruthless opportunistic mindset, willing to take advantage of Luffy's weakened state to kill him and take his Devil Fruit, despite the fact that Luffy was the country's best chance at saving them from the oppressive Doflamingo. This is further shown when he tried to kill Sabo just to get his hands on the Mera Mera no Mi when he interfered in his attempts to kill Luffy, believing that it was his right to have the fruit.
He is also very determined and stubborn as he ignored his injured state and infiltrated Sabo's ship and so he could find the Revolutionary Army's headquarters and managed to stay hidden for days before informing his comrades.
After Blackbeard had become an
Emperor
and began going by the new title of "Admiral Teach", Burgess repeatedly forgets to address Blackbeard by this moniker and habitually calls him "Captain Teach", prompting
Laffitte
to remind him several times in the past not to do this.
According to himself, he is attached to the crew's raft.
Burgess'
signature laugh
is "Wiiihahaha!"
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Marshall D. Teach
[
]
Burgess is extremely loyal to his captain,
Blackbeard
but has gotten impatient with his casual approach. When Ace attacked Blackbeard, Burgess jumped to his defense until Blackbeard ordered him not to fight the Whitebeard Pirate commander. He also cheered on his captain for successfully stealing the
Gura Gura no Mi
.
Blackbeard also trusted Burgess as he sent him to Dressrosa to acquire Ace's Devil Fruit, the
Mera Mera no Mi
. Even though
Laffitte
reminded Burgess that Blackbeard is called
Admiral
Teach, he still addressed him captain.
Kuzan
[
]
Though Blackbeard was willing to recruit
Kuzan
, Burgess was not so quick to trust him due to him being a former Marine admiral.
Enemies
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
As one of the members of the Blackbeard Pirates, Burgess is
Luffy's
enemy. At
Dressrosa
, Burgess was amused after discovering that Luffy was competing for the
Mera Mera no Mi
and when Luffy declared that he would not let him have Ace's power.
He later attempted to kill him for the
Gomu Gomu no Mi
only to be stopped by Sabo.
Sabo
[
]
As Luffy's sworn brother,
Sabo
is an enemy to Burgess. At the Corrida Colosseum, Burgess fought Sabo for the Mera Mera no Mi and was displeased when the latter ate the fruit. During the Birdcage game, Sabo stopped Burgess from killing Luffy and told him that he was Luffy's brother as well as Ace's. Burgess was amused but tried to ignore Sabo though after Sabo revealed he ate the Mera Mera no Mi, he decided to go after him.
After defeating Burgess, Sabo was just going to walk away but Burgess spoke ill of Ace, in an attempt to kill Sabo. A furious Sabo evaded his attack and injured him further, by severely burning him.
Burgess managed to survive and stowaway on board a ship that took him to the
Revolutionary Army
's base at
Baltigo
.
When informing his comrades of his location, Burgess is shown to detest Sabo as he insulted him and told the rest of Blackbeard Pirates to attack
Baltigo
, forcing the revolutionaries to relocate their base of operations.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the
helmsman
of the
Blackbeard Pirates
and one of its founding members, Burgess is an extremely powerful pirate.
After the time-skip, he has become the captain of the first ship of the Blackbeard Pirates,
and is also, according to
Gatz
, one of the Ten Titanic Captains that personally guard the
Emperor
,
Blackbeard
.
He defeated every challenger he fought in
Mock Town
with ease
and, after the time-skip, won the A Block of the
Corrida Colosseum
battle royale within seconds, all without a single injury. His mere presence at the Corrida Colosseum was enough to terrify all the nearby gladiators, mighty warriors in their own right.
Based off of his attempt on Luffy's life for the Gomu Gomu no Mi and his conversation with Sabo, he knows of a method of stealing Devil Fruit abilities from others.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Burgess has tremendous physical strength. He easily ripped an entire building off its foundations and threw it at Ace across a great distance, while carrying it in the air. In the Corrida Colosseum, he completely overpowered all of his opponents in A Block (including a giant in the anime) by himself single-handedly within seconds. Burgess's strength also extends to his extremely sturdy legs as he jumped down from Dressrosa's immensely high royal palace to the country's street level without a scratch, allowing him to make it to Luffy's location in a very short amount of time, a feat that greatly shocked Koala.
In terms of hand-to-hand combat, Burgess is also an immensely powerful and skilled wrestler. His wrestling attacks such as elbow strikes and lariats can generate massive, air pressure-based shockwaves that can demolish buildings with great ease.
Burgess also possesses massive endurance and durability, as seen (pre time-skip) when he took a direct hit from a
Gura Gura no Mi
strike from former
Emperor
Edward Newgate
,
as well as
Fleet Admiral
Sengoku
's shockwave in his
Buddha form
without suffering much damage. In Dressrosa, Burgess took Sabo's Kaen Ryuou at point blank range, which blasted him with enough firepower to smash him through several buildings, and recovered enough to quickly resume the battle. After being defeated by Sabo in a heavily injured state, Burgess survived being brutally burned by Sabo's
Hiken
after his failed attempt to steal the Mera Mera no Mi. Despite suffering this much damage, Burgess could stow himself away on a ship of the Revolutionary Army travelling to Baltigo for an extended period of time without any medical treatment, allowing him to contact Laffitte to inform him of his location in Baltigo while still on the verge of death, showing considerable stealth and infiltration skills as well.
Attacks
[
]
Hado Elbow
(
波動エルボー
,
Hadō Erubō
?
, literally meaning "Wave Motion Elbow")
: Burgess attacks with an elbow strike powerful enough to cause huge shock waves upon the impact. It was first seen during the finals of Corrida Colosseum against a Fighting Fish, sending it flying away, and at the same time a shock wave to the audience, causing massive destruction.
In the anime, his arm vibrates while preparing for the attack and his elbow emits vibrational waves similar to those of
Hasshoken
techniques. In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Shockwave Elbow
.
Galleon Lariat
(
不沈艦
ラリアット

As they made their way through Level 1, they encountered former Head Jailer
Shiryu
, and then made their way down to Level 4, where they encountered the escaping prisoners.

After Blackbeard had confronted
Whitebeard
, the Blackbeard Pirates struck down Whitebeard.

The Blackbeard Pirates made their move in the
New World
, taking out
Jewelry Bonney
in the process. The crew was bickering amongst each other on a fiery island. The
Blackbeard Pirates' raft
was brought close to the point of destruction due to
Sanjuan Wolf
's size, and they seemingly got in contact with the
Marines
to trade Jewelry Bonney for a battleship. On look out, Van Augur alerted Teach that the battleship had arrived, but not for a trade, because
Akainu
was on board. Knowing that the deal would not happen, the Blackbeard Pirates fled, leaving Bonney and
her crew
behind to be arrested.
During the Timeskip
[
]
One year after the war at Marineford, the Blackbeard Pirates
fought against
the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates and ultimately won.
The Blackbeard Pirates used Teach's knowledge of Whitebeard's former territory to conquer nearly all of it. Now that Blackbeard had become an
Emperor
, the Blackbeard Pirates began hunting down powerful Devil Fruit users in order to absorb their abilities.
At some point, the Blackbeard Pirates expanded, and Burgess became one of the
Ten Titanic Captains
, leading the first ship of the fleet.
The Blackbeard Pirates party with Kuzan after their initial encounter.
At some point, the crew arrived at an island in the New World, where some of them were frozen by the former
Admiral
Kuzan. However, the latter and Teach started talking and drinking, so Kuzan got rid of the freezing. After the former Marine talked about his fight with Akainu,
Catarina Devon
asked him about "
the man with the burn mark
". As Kuzan had no knowledge about this, Burgess told him about the
Road Poneglyphs
and how
Kaidou
and
Big Mom
are known to have one each; while Teach added that "the man with the burn mark" could lead them to the fourth. After some speculation about the latter, Kuzan replied that he did not see a red Poneglyph in
Ohara
and began to tell why this brought back bad memories for him; though Burgess simply began to laugh upon hearing it. Suddenly hearing Lafitte suggest that they steal
his Devil Fruit
, Kuzan froze some of the crew members again, but Teach convinced the former Admiral to join the crew.
After
Trafalgar Law
caused what is now known as the
Rocky Port Incident
the Blackbeard Pirates made the island
Hachinosu
their base of operations.

Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Burgess reveals himself to the spectators in the Corrida Colosseum.
Burgess entered the monthly
Corrida Colosseum
tournament as "Mr. Store" to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
and was assigned to A Block. It did not take him long to defeat all of his opponents and he was declared the winner of the A Block battle royale. He then removed the paper bag mask he was wearing and revealed his identity, shocking the spectators and the other fighters.
During the fight between Luffy (as Lucy) and Chinjao, Burgess went to the observation deck and commented that Block C had gotten interesting. He then wondered who Lucy was.
After witnessing Lucy's victory, Burgess realized that the man was in fact Luffy and got excited.
After Block C ended, Burgess spoke to Blackbeard via Den Den Mushi. Teach was discussing the possibility of recruiting
Kuzan
to join their crew, but Burgess stated that the former admiral could not be trusted. When Luffy stopped by, Burgess handed the Den Den Mushi to him, allowing him to speak to Blackbeard. When Luffy declared that he would not allow the Blackbeard Pirates to get Ace's power, Burgess merely laughed.
Burgess and Lucy clash.
After Rebecca had won Block D, Burgess looked forward for the finals.
He later entered the arena alongside Lucy (now
Sabo
), Bartolomeo, Rebecca, and Diamante. After Diamante explained the rules of this round, a five-person battle royale commenced.
A fighting fish attacked Burgess, but he easily repelled it and sent it flying towards the audience. He later clashed against Lucy, who managed to break the armor around his right arm.
Despite that setback, Burgess continued to engage Lucy in heated combat, causing more damage to the colosseum in the process.
During the time the toys in the audience transformed back into their original forms, Burgess was surprised when Lucy demolished the entire arena with his bare hands.
After Lucy had acquired the power of the Mera Mera no Mi and destroyed the arena, Burgess fell into the underground trade port. Burgess then noticed that Lucy was not Luffy and was frustrated that he lost the Devil Fruit.
Burgess attempts to kill Luffy.
On top of the royal palace during the final battle between Luffy and Doflamingo, Burgess watched as the events unfolded while wondering what to do next.
After Luffy's
Gear 4
wore off, Burgess took an opportunity to attempt to kill Luffy for the
Gomu Gomu no Mi
. He jumped down from the palace and pursued him. Before he could strike Luffy, Sabo intercepted him.
Having enraged Sabo, Burgess is defeated by a grievous Fire Fist attack.
Sabo then informed him of his relationship to Luffy and Burgess realized that Sabo was the Lucy who fought in the colosseum final after Sabo revealed he ate the Mera Mera no Mi. With Sabo standing in his way, Burgess decided to take his Devil Fruit power and the two subsequently clashed.
Despite his efforts, Burgess was eventually defeated by Sabo. As the revolutionary was leaving, Burgess asked him if he was going to kill him. Sabo replied that there was no point in doing so. However, Burgess goaded Sabo into staying by telling him what Ace said when he was captured. Burgess mocked the latter for choosing such pathetic words causing Sabo to become angered and grab Burgess' head as the latter continued to spew insults. Burgess then drew a concealed dagger, preparing to kill Sabo for his Devil Fruit. Sabo reprimanded Burgess for his words as Burgess mocked Sabo for not being there to save his brother and attempted to kill him. However, having heard enough, Sabo attacked Burgess with point blank Fire Fist, both burning and sending the screaming Burgess flying.

Severely wounded, Burgess informs his crew he has found the Revolutionary Army's base.
After his defeat at the hands of Sabo, a heavily injured Burgess secretly boarded a ship that took him to
Baltigo
. On the verge of death, he lost consciousness and was unable to tell his crewmates he had left Dressrosa, who came looking for him. After regaining consciousness, he later contacted Shiryu and Laffitte and confirmed the island as the Revolutionary Army's main headquarters, where
Dragon
and Sabo were currently residing, an island hidden from the world that neither he nor the world knew about. Burgess asked for the crew to come find him and also bring Doc Q to treat his injuries, as he was on the verge of death. He then told them to inform Teach and get the entire crew to attack the island, who would be able to reach him using his
Vivre Card
.
The Blackbeard Pirates later attacked Baltigo, destroying the island by the time the
Marines
and
Cipher Pol
arrived, but the Revolutionary Army was able to escape. However, the Blackbeard Pirates fled after briefly clashing with Cipher Pol.

Stronger
to steal of the
Road Poneglyphs
from any arriving crew. When they saw the
Polar Tang
of the
Heart Pirates

teleported
Burgess to the island, who then lifted an entire mountain, displaying his
newfound power
, before throwing it at the Heart Pirates. However, Law destroyed the entire mountain with
his own abilities
, where Teach would then appear to confront Law himself.
Subsequently, the crew managed to defeat the Heart Pirates, leaving almost all of them in the sea along with the sunken and destroyed Polar Tang. Afterwards, Burguess and the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates surrounded an unconscious Law, while Teach contemplated what to do with the latter's Ope Ope no Mi. However,

Pizarro
for all the trouble that had occurred. However, when some of his subordinates encouraged him, the Commodore calmed down and laughed as morale rose, stating that they should take advantage of it. When Teach and Kuzan discussed how they now had Garp captured, Burgess stated that the wind was now in their favor. After celebrating that they were able to capture
Charlotte Pudding
as well, the Emperor asked the others to contact Laffite, something they agreed to do. Shortly after, Pizarro informed them that
Catarina Devon
and Van Augur had returned.
