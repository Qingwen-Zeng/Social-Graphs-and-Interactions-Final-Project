History
[
]
Past
[
]
Some time in the past, Mornin became the mayor of Syrup Village. Ever since Usopp began routinely yelling about pirates attacking, Mornin has used this as a sign to signal that it was time to get to work.
Syrup Village Arc
[
]
After Usopp came running into town screaming about pirates attacking, Mornin had just finished eating breakfast. Upon hearing the troublemaker run past his house yelling, Mornin calmly continued to drink his coffee and commented on how it was time for him to get to work since Usopp was already up.
The next day, Mornin's wife told him that he would be late for work, surprising him since Usopp had not come running into town yet.
Adaptation Differences
[
]
Anime
[
]
As the anime version of the
Syrup Village Arc
deliberately highlights the hostility between Usopp and most of his fellow villagers, it does not depict Mornin (nor many other villagers who appear to tolerate and enjoy Usopp's antics). The much-later
Episode of East Blue
special serves as his animated debut, faithfully adapting his appearance during Usopp's introduction.
Live-action series
[
]
Mornin has a more notable participation in the
live-action series
, appearing to scold Usopp for shouting that the pirates are coming. In Usopp's childhood, Mornin brought Usopp to Banchina after her son lied again about the pirates' arrival. When Usopp alerts the town about Kuro's identity as a pirate, he calls Mornin's house for help, but he and everyone thinks he's doing lying routine again. Mornin refuses to listen to him and yells at him to go home and pushes him away and close the door.
