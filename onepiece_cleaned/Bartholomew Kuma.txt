Bartholomew Kuma
is a former
Warlord of the Sea
, the former
king
of the
Sorbet Kingdom
,
and an
officer
and founding member of the
Revolutionary Army
with a
bounty
of
296,000,000.
As a
pirate
, Kuma sailed the
seas
as a single-person pirate crew.
He is also the adoptive father of
Jewelry Bonney
,
daughter of his late friend and fellow revolutionary
Ginny
.
Kuma is a member of the near-extinct special
race
known as the
Buccaneers
, inherited from his late father
Clapp
.
Because of the lies the
World Government
told the public, Kuma became feared as an extremely vicious pirate,
earning himself the title
"Tyrant"
.
In exchange for curing Bonney of the deadly
Sapphire Scales
disease
, Kuma became a special type of
cyborg
known as a "
Pacifista
", developed by the
world
renowned
scientist
Vegapunk
.
Once Vegapunk finished his modifications on Kuma, the Warlord was converted into the first complete Pacifista cyborg, with the serial
PX-0
, and mentally died in the process.
Vegapunk also
cloned
Kuma as
S-Bear
, one of the
Seraphim
that were designed to replace the Warlords.
Kuma has been
enslaved
by the
World Nobles
twice in his lifetime:
The first time was in his infancy until he escaped during the
God Valley Incident
and the second time in adulthood as punishment for the two years he spent protecting the
Thousand Sunny
and lasted until his fellow revolutionaries freed him during the most recent
Levely
.
While Kuma was presented as a major antagonist during the
Thriller Bark
and
Sabaody Archipelago Arcs
, he was secretly an ally and his
action of separating
the
Straw Hat Pirates
was ultimately done in their best interest, as it saved them from
Admiral
Kizaru
and helped the crew's
captain
Monkey D. Luffy
realize that his crew was too weak to survive in the
New World
; thus, Kuma played a key role in the subsequent
timeskip
.
In his mindless state, Kuma is a major antagonist in the
Marineford Arc
where he took part in the
Summit War of Marineford
and sided with the
Marines
, along with most of the other Warlords,
but he later becomes a major ally during the
Egghead Arc
and an important figure behind its ongoings.

What is the story behind Kuma's flashback in the series?
In the series, Bartholomew Kuma's flashback reveals his deep connection to the Revolutionary Army and his belief in Luffy's potential. Kuma was present during the training of Sabo, another key figure in the series. He also had a mysterious trip to the Goa Kingdom, where he observed Luffy's training from a distance. This sparked his interest in Luffy's growth and heroic deeds. Kuma's flashback also reveals his participation in an experiment conducted by Vegapunk, where he willingly gave up his own freedom and memories. These memories were manifested into a paw bubble for Vegapunk to study. Before his humanity was erased, Kuma declared his faith in Luffy and his crew to change the world.

How does Kuma's adopted daughter play a role in saving the world?
Bartholomew Kuma adopted a daughter named Bonney. Despite not being related by blood, Kuma was a devoted father figure to Bonney, raising her with unconditional love and care. He was extremely protective of her, especially due to her health condition. Kuma even left the Revolutionary Army to keep watch over her. When the Sorbet Kingdom was set on fire, Kuma risked his own safety to rescue the victims, showing his heroic nature.

Appearance
[
]
Kuma is an enormous man, being 689 cm tall. He is the second tallest of the former Warlords (being three centimeters shorter than
Gecko Moria
) and is usually seen carrying a Bible. His hair is generally long and curly, and sometimes includes a pair of round protrusions resembling bear ears.
He wears glasses with clear-mirrored lenses which cover his
cybernetic
eyes. Prior to his conversion into a cyborg, his eyes were normal.
His white hat and the dark blue fabric of his pants are covered in brown spots. His jacket contains a large white design reminiscent of a target crosshair or a
coda sign
.
There are also several white paw prints lining the bottom hem of his coat. He also has a long protruding chin. He bears the tattoo "PX-0" on the left side of the base of his throat, after the final touches were done on him becoming a complete
cyborg
before the
Summit War of Marineford
.
In the anime, Kuma's hair and jacket are black, and his hat is gray with black paw-like prints. In the manga,
Oda
originally intended for Kuma to have a completely different color scheme. Kuma's hair was shown to be brown, his jacket bright orange, and his hat yellow with green spots.
Later on the cover of
Chapter 532
, his coat was changed from orange to blue, though the rest of his design remained untouched.
Later still, on
Volume 90
, Kuma's hair was changed to black, matching his depiction in the anime.
In Unlimited Cruise, Kuma's jacket is brown.
After the timeskip, Kuma's cybernetic armor has become heavily damaged, with a few weapons jutting out of his body, fruits of his mission to protect the
Thousand Sunny
from attackers for two years. Due to his subsequent enslaving at
Mary Geoise
, he wore rags similar to the ones
Jean Bart
once wore when he was a slave, a collar and chain around his neck, has even more swords jutting out of his body as result of the
World Nobles
inflicting damage onto him for their own amusement, one of his cybernetic eyes is missing and he no longer holds his signature Bible. After he was freed from slavery, he went back to his original clothes and had all the swords removed from his body and it appears that his cybernetics have been repaired. After encountering
Sakazuki
at Mary Geoise, a portion of Kuma's face was burned off by the fleet admiral's
magma
.
Having been a
slave
to the
World Nobles
as a child and in adulthood, Kuma should have been branded with the Hoof of the Flying Dragon,
though it is unknown where it is on his body.
As a child, Kuma's head was shaved, thus lacking his bear ears, glasses, and
cybernetic enhancements
he received later on. He was already bigger than average children and usually wore tattered clothing.
As a baby and a four-year old, he had blushy cheeks, which he inherited from his mother.

Personality
[
]
Kuma is a tragic and complex individual who has experienced major turmoils and sacrifices throughout his life that have greatly altered his overall character. While kind and self-sacrificing at heart, his struggles and choices have ultimately led him to a point where he can no longer be considered a live human being with free will.
During his early childhood, Kuma was a pretty cheerful kid before his subsequent enslavement and the death of his parents broke him into utter despair. That said, the buccaneer folk tales about the legend of
Nika
his father
Clapp
told him gave Kuma happiness, hope and a hero figure to idolize amidst his life as a slave. Kuma has since grown into someone who seeks to liberate people from oppression by corrupt authorities, much like the figure of Nika, due to having been an oppressed victim himself. He has similarly shared this story with his daughter Bonney, in order to provide the same hope to her that his father once did to him. As a result of his worship of Nika and likely love for his deceased father, Kuma tends to break into dancing to the Rhythm of Liberation whenever the topic of his idol comes up.
Kuma praying for the lost lives of the Native Hunting Competition.
Because he was raised in a church, Kuma is deeply religious and tends to pray for long periods, which is reflected nowadays by his signature bible and aforementioned devotion to Nika. Even after escaping slavery, young Kuma was extremely kind and forgiving, willing to use his powers to treat the wounds of even those who would bully him, never showing any sort of grudge or resentment against said people. He would eventually grow up into an altruistic pastor, always helping those in need even if at the expense of his own life and physical well-being.
In spite of his epithet implying a violent personality, Kuma was an extraordinarily gentle man, whose kindness earned him great respect from his fellow Revolutionaries.
That said, there was a period after the abduction of his friend and romantic interest
Ginny
when Kuma became a more audacious and aggressive soldier who would recklessly charge into battle by himself, often exhausting himself as a result. It was only after making contact with Ginny again and finding an infant Bonney near her dead mother that Kuma would revert back to his original mellow persona.
Kuma gratefully accepting his fate in order to have Bonney cured.
Kuma was a very loving father to his adopted daughter, Bonney, having raised her out of love and respect for Ginny.
Indeed, Bonney vouched that her father's reputation as an evil tyrant was falsely advertised by the Government and that he is in fact, an extremely kind individual.
When King Bekori set fire to the southern side of Sorbet Kingdom to massacre the poor citizens by burning them alive in their homes, Kuma risked his own safety in an attempt to rescue the victims by braving the raging inferno, which led to him being elected King by Sorbet's population due to his great benevolence and selflessness. By Kuma's own admission, he is a pacifist by nature, although one willing to fight back, if necessary, in order to maintain peace.
Even after taking part in the
Pacifista
project and becoming an agent for the World Government, Kuma kept most of his original personality and positive qualities intact for a brief time, but still had to maintain an intimidating image towards pirates due to his position as a Warlord of the Sea, which likely further contributed to his image as a loyal "government dog" among those who did not know him (even other Warlords, such as
Gecko Moria
). During this time, he consistently acted calm and composed; he generally did not speak much unless it was absolutely necessary and maintained a stoic disposition at all times. While he would still exhibit some unique quirks of his own, like using the word "target" in his sentences or asking people where they would like to go on a holiday before sending them away with his
Devil Fruit
ability (a habit that he seemingly picked up from his time as a stay-at-home father),
Kuma always presented himself as a serious, enigmatic person, keeping very few people aware of his true motivations. Despite earning himself such an unflattering reputation, Kuma's usual mercy and empathy were put on display when he honored and respected
Zoro
's choice for putting his own life on the line for his captain's safety. Kuma was willing to give the swordsman a chance to save
Luffy
, in spite of conflicting with the mission that he was assigned.
Kuma delivers his message to Rayleigh.
Despite being perceived as the most dutiful of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Kuma was never really loyal to the World Government's cause and frequently acted against their interests through subtle, deniable manners. Kuma's loyalty similarly did not extend to the
Marines
.
Because of that, Kuma did not hesitate to lie to
Sengoku
when it came to his ambiguous victory over the Straw Hat Pirates at
Sabaody Archipelago
, as no one could prove that he was in fact helping them in secret. Most of Kuma's obedience towards his superiors seemingly came from their hold over his daughter Bonney, as a consequence of the terms he had to agree with the government to save her life. In spite of said terms being incredibly damaging to Kuma himself, he gladly accepted them, citing that Bonney's life was his ultimate priority.
Outside his daughter, Kuma's sole loyalty remains towards the
Revolutionary Army
, of which he still considers himself to be part of despite his current position as a Warlord and prior resignation from the rebel group, even showing a desire to return and fight alongside his former comrades once more. Kuma has admired the efforts of
Monkey D. Dragon
since the latter's time as the leader of the
Freedom Fighters
, believing the group were akin to heroes who helped people around the world. It is also heavily implied that Luffy being the son of Dragon was the main reason for Kuma's continued assistance of the Straw Hat Pirates.
Kuma getting his brain and free will reprogrammed.
At present, with Kuma's Pacifista modifications having been completed, he completely lost his free will, personality and memory in order to ensure his reliability and continuing services towards the World Government. In this stage, Kuma shares the same mindless intelligence of his fellow Pacifista models, only recognizing individuals as either enemies or allies to the government.
Doflamingo
refers to the original personality as being "dead",
though it was later revealed that Kuma and Dr.
Vegapunk
(the man responsible for his cybernetic implants) made a secret deal to allow for Kuma to have a temporary relapse by rendering his final "free thought" as defending the Thousand Sunny. After that, Kuma was relegated to working as a slave-to-rent and obeying the demands of the
World Nobles
without question. After being freed by the Revolutionaries, he no longer appeared to have any sort of humanity left within him.
A few days after Kuma was rescued by the Revolutionaries,
Jaygarcia Saturn
activated a failsafe that he demanded Vegapunk install in Kuma; while Saturn's intent was for Vegapunk to install a bomb in Kuma, Vegapunk instead merely designed the switch to completely shut off Kuma's body and mind, effectively rendering him lifeless. During the same time, possibly in response to being programmed to shut down, enough of Kuma's personality reawakened for him to instinctively travel to his daughter at
Egghead
and protect her from Saturn.
Ever since, despite remaining incapable of normal speech, he has shown bits of emotions such as embracing Bonney after saving her, reacting to Luffy taking on the appearance of Nika, listening intently to Bonney's speech to Saturn as she defeated him while taking on Nika's form, smiling after she defeated him, and smiling while holding Bonney on the
Great Eirik
.
While he is still a far cry from the man he used to be, these displays have suggested that he may once again be able to feel and express emotion as he once did.
Relationships

Parents
[

Kuma with his enslaved parents.
Kuma and his parents loved each other very much. His father
Clapp
wanted to protect him from slavery by the
World Nobles
because of his Buccaneer heritage. Despite Kuma feeling very sad about his mother's death and enduring hardships as a slave, Clapp always cheered him up by telling him about the Warrior
Nika
and that they would be rescued by him. It is because of his father's words that Kuma wanted to become a hero and help slaves someday.
Jewelry Bonney
[
]
Kuma teaching Bonney about Nika.
Kuma is
Bonney
's adoptive father, and the only family member she has left. The two of them had a very loving relationship, as Bonney had fond memories of her childhood with him. Though not related by blood, Kuma was an extremely devoted father figure, doing his best to raise Bonney with unconditional love and care in honor of her mother Ginny, being emotionally moved by her growth since she was an infant.
Because of Bonney's
condition
, Kuma was very protective of her, making sure to do anything in his power to prevent her disease from getting worse, leaving the
Revolutionary Army
in order to keep watch over her. Still, he wished to find a cure for his adopted daughter's disease and then travel around the world with her. The reveal that Bonney would likely die before she could enjoy life, however, left him heartbroken.
Kuma became a pirate in order to find someone who could treat Bonney's disease. He eventually met with Dr. Vegapunk, who claimed that he could do exactly so. Still, because the World Government became aware of his attempts to strike an illegal deal with Vegapunk, he had to agree to additional terms that essentially sacrificed his own body and mind for the government's use. Kuma gladly accepted this and did not regret his decision, having stated that he would even deal with the devil if it meant allowing Bonney a chance to live.
While Kuma acted as a Warlord, he would often send loving letters to Bonney. Unbeknown to him though, his letters were all intercepted and destroyed by
Cipher Pol
agent
Alpha
, who was in charge of Bonney's "well-being" following his deal with the government. Because Kuma's letters never reached her due to Alpha's meddling, Bonney would be left frustrated and disappointed throughout her recovery period, yet she never stopped believing in her father, deciding to leave Sorbet and become a pirate in order to reunite with him.
While Kuma was aware that Bonney had set out to sea specifically to reunite with him, he preferred to keep himself away from her in order to honor his prior deal with the World Government and avoid jeopardazing Bonney's own safety. Kuma would keep thinking over Bonney until his last moments of free will, requesting Vegapunk to wish her a happy birthday in his stead, knowing that he would be unable to do so after his modifications were completed.
Kuma reunites with Bonney.
Bonney, who was unaware of the arrangements her father had to make to save her life, shows an intense rage towards the World Government for enslaving him and allowing him to suffer abuse at the hands of the World Nobles. Because she is so devoted to her father, Bonney has major reservations over witnessing the
Pacifista
getting attacked, due to their
resemblance
to Kuma. When Bonney discovered the true reason behind Kuma's conversion into a Pacifista, she broke down in tears and was on the verge of losing the will to live. When she was about to be killed by Saturn, Kuma, however, miraculously managed to reach her in time and struck Saturn, embracing Bonney with a warm hug, after four years of being separated, but unable to speak. Kuma also shows his smile to Bonney for beating up Saturn in order to repel the Elder. After escaping Egghead, Kuma and Bonney are happy when they are together again.
Sorbet's Citizens
[
]
As a priest, Kuma was beloved by the elderly population of Sorbet, particularly those who lived in village near his church. Every weekend, Kuma would use his abilities to take their pain away to absorb them himself later. Because the elders were physically unable to contribute much to Sorbet's Heavenly Tribute, they relied on Kuma's "miracles" in order to remain healthy and fit, as otherwise they would be imprisoned by King Bekori's draconian policies.
Even after becoming a Revolutionary, Kuma would still occasionally return to Sorbet to watch over his elderly friends. The elders also assisted Kuma in raising an infant Bonney, giving him tips about how to do so and directly taking care of her while he went out for revolutionary missions.
Kuma was also friends with
Gyogyo
and other younger citizens of similar age to his, having befriended them shortly after escaping slavedom when he was nine. Kuma and Ginny mostly lived through food donations provided by them. As Kuma prepared to have his personality erased, Gyogyo was one of the people he recalled.
After deposing of Bekori six years ago and saving the country from his destructive policies, Kuma was elected King by the population of Sorbet. Despite having no interest in ruling the kingdom, Kuma still accepted the role as he did not feel like going against popular demand.
Bulldog
[
]
Bulldog
was Kuma's advisor during the latter's tenure as king, taking care of Sorbet's political matters while Kuma remained working in his church. As a former king himself, Bulldog's own leadership qualities were trusted by Kuma.
When Kuma had to abandon Sorbet in order to confront Bekori, he had no problems entrusting the country and his own daughter Bonney to Bulldog's care.
Revolutionaries
[
]
Kuma drinking with the Revolutionary Army.
Prior to receiving his final modifications, Kuma was a loyal member of the
Revolutionary Army
, having been one of the organization's original founders alongside his comrades Dragon and
Ivankov
. Even after resigning from the army due to Bonney's health, Kuma never stopped thinking of himself as a revolutionary soldier.
Kuma is deeply respected by his fellow revolutionaries as
Sabo
,
Morley
,
Karasu
, and
Lindbergh
planned to liberate Kuma from his torturous slavery during their infiltration of
Mary Geoise
, which they successfully did and escaped with him. Sabo and
Koala
in particular did not understand at first why Kuma became an agent of the government, unaware of the special circumstances surrounding him that led to his status as a Warlord.
Monkey D. Dragon
[
]
When he was around 22, Kuma became aware of
Monkey D. Dragon
through newspaper articles. He already admired Dragon's
Freedom Fighters
at the time and was more than happy to follow him, especially after Sorbet's liberation from King
Bekori
's tyranny. Dragon, meanwhile, became aware of Kuma through Ivankov's recommendations.
Dragon guaranteed to Kuma that joining the organization was the right choice to make, and Kuma would prove himself to be a highly effective asset for the organization. Even after Kuma left the army in order to spend more time with Bonney due to her illness, Dragon was not against his decision and encouraged him to live without regrets. He also promised Kuma that he would try to contact any doctors who could go on to help his daughter.
Kuma also had knowledge of Luffy being Dragon's son
(something that even Ivankov was unaware of until he met the boy). Back during an operation at Goa, Kuma happened to see Dragon watching over a boy at
Foosha Village
and deduced that they could have been related, asking his superior if there was any truth to that. While Dragon did imply Kuma's suspicions were correct, he refused to outright confirm them, with Kuma deciding to drop the subject due to noticing Dragon's discomfort. Kuma subsequently spared the Straw Hats' lives on two occasions, as well as guarding their ship for 2 years from the likes of pirates and Marines, due to their common connection.
Though Kuma was working with the Revolutionary Army in secret as a
Warlord
(although he refused to speak with them for unknown reasons), his final modification into a full
Pacifista
now places him fully under the
World Government
's control. Dragon is seemingly not aware of Kuma's deal with the
Marines
, but respected Kuma's wishes to not be followed or talked with before losing his free will for good.
After Kuma was recovered from his second enslavement by the revolutionaries, he identified Dragon as only his "master" due to his new programming overriding his old personality.
Ginny
[
]
Ginny defending Kuma from bullies.
Ginny
was Kuma's fellow slave and romantic interest who had met at God Valley. It was thanks to Ginny's ingenuity that Kuma was given an opportunity to escape his masters' and the
Native Hunting Competition
.
When Kuma returned to the Sorbet Kingdom, Ginny decided to stay with him since she had no idea yet of what to do in life. She went on to live happily with Kuma, having full meals and living through honest work after leaving their slavedom behind. She was also protective of Kuma against bullies and acted as his "big sis", being four years his senior. As adults, Ginny would often chastise Kuma for his self-sacrifices regarding the elderly population of Sorbet, taking care of him afterwards every time he took in their pain.
Kuma mourns Ginny's death.
While Kuma had mutual feelings for Ginny and enjoyed having her at his side, he refused to accept her marriage proposal due to what happened with his mother, who was enslaved solely for having a buccaneer husband. Despite this, Ginny still remained loyal to Kuma and was smitten with him even during their time in the
Revolutionary Army
. After Ginny was captured by the World Government, Kuma became deeply enraged, recklessly charging into battle alone. After two years, when Ginny contacted Kuma to tell her that she was dying and proclaimed her love for him, he immediately headed for the chapel they grew up together in, knowing she would be there. After finding her dead, Kuma profusely wept for her as he reminisced of all the time they spent together and buried her, promising to raise her daughter in her stead.
Ginny frequently referred to Kuma as "Kuma-chi".
Emporio Ivankov
[
]
Ivankov and Kuma confronting each other at Marineford.
When Kuma was nine years old, he first met a fifteen-year-old
Ivankov
at
God Valley
as both were slaves at the time. They both worked together to successfully escape the Native Hunting Competition, with Ivankov praising Kuma for his actions of humility and self-sacrifice during their plan. Kuma's use of the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi also led Ivankov to dub Kuma as having the
Hands of Liberation
(
解放の手
,
Kaihō no Te
?
)
. When they parted ways during their childhood, Kuma told Ivankov he would never forget his face as long as he lives.
Ivankov later recommended Kuma as a possible recruit for Dragon's freedom fighting goals, with the two freeing Kuma from imprisonment following King Bekori's fall. The two would go on to become close as Revolutionary comrades later on in life, with Ivankov knowing of Kuma's deep hatred for the World Government.
When Ivankov saw Kuma at the
Summit War of Marineford
, the former was shocked to see that Kuma was no longer the man he once was, which led to them confronting each other. Ivankov also claims Kuma fears him to some extent and was set to make him remember that cyborg or not.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Kuma overshadowing the Straw Hat Pirates.
Kuma believes the
Straw Hat Pirates
are destined to save and bring justice to the world somehow, having acknowledged the many impressive, if not miraculous, feats the crew has pulled since they began their pirate career all the way back in the
East Blue
, starting with
Arlong
's defeat. Since then, he has accompanied their growth through the news, although never getting to meet them personally until the events of the
Thriller Bark Arc
. He first met
Nami
and was courteous enough to not engage her in battle, merely questioning her about the nature of Luffy and Ace's relationship.
After Kuma witnessed Luffy defeating
Gecko Moria
, he reported it to the World Government, and they ordered Kuma to kill all witnesses on
Thriller Bark
, including the Straw Hats. As most of the pirates were already exhausted from fighting Moria, Kuma had little challenge in finishing them off. After a brief fight with
Zoro
, Kuma offered to spare everyone else if they allowed him to take Luffy alone, as that was his primary mission to begin with. They refused and Kuma, seemingly disappointed that he had to kill them all, attacked his opponents with an Ursus Shock, knocking out most of the Straw Hats.
Before Kuma could take Luffy away, Zoro, who was still conscious, attacked one last time and learned about Kuma's cybernetic nature. Seeing no other way to win as Kuma was still stronger and had the upper hand, Zoro offered to trade his life for Luffy's, with Sanji attempting to do the same only for Zoro to stop him. With his own honor at stake, Kuma agreed to Zoro's terms and subjugated him into experiencing the pain Luffy endured throughout his fight against Moria. Acknowledging Zoro's loyalty, Kuma even mused about Dragon having a good son with a loyal crew.
After the events of Thriller Bark, Kuma witnessed another
outrageous incident
where the World Noble
Charlos
was physically assaulted by Luffy at the
Human Auctioning House
. This was enough to spur Kuma into saving the crew's life once more, helping them escape Admiral
Kizaru
and
Sentomaru
.
He gave Luffy one final farewell before sending him to
Amazon Lily
and losing his free will to the
Pacifista
project's finalization. Kuma's motives for this unexpected action were clear: the crew was not ready for the
New World
yet and needed to become far stronger.
He also made a deal with
Vegapunk
to program him to protect the
Thousand Sunny
until a Straw Hat member returned. Franky told the other Straw Hats that they owed a debt to Kuma, although he noted the next time they would meet, Kuma would be a heartless, human weapon. When Kuma arrived at Egghead to save Bonney, Franky decided to act on this debt for helping the Straw Hats two years ago at Sabaody, by protecting him against Saturn along with Sanji.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Kuma placing his hopes in Luffy.
Kuma knows a lot about
Monkey D. Luffy
, as he was aware that
Portgas D. Ace
and
Monkey D. Dragon
were his adoptive brother and biological father, respectively, despite both relationships not being public matter at the time.
Back when he was still a revolutionary, Kuma suspected that Dragon may have had a family back in the
Goa Kingdom
during a trip there, something that Dragon only indirectly confirmed and refused to elaborate further, which Kuma understood as an sensitive topic to talk about with his superior.
Around the time Luffy was 16, Kuma once headed to
Mt. Colubo
in order to confirm his suspicions about Dragon, leading him to find Luffy and observe his training from afar. Ever since then, Kuma has been accompanying the boy's growth and heroic deeds through news and bounty posters, while also pondering about his similarities to Nika, as a person who similarly opposed the World Government through his
rubber abilities
.
Kuma later witnessed Luffy breaking the greatest taboo by striking a Celestial Dragon to save his friend
Hatchan
, which led the Warlord to hold high hopes for the boy and his potential to save the world, thus Kuma worked to secretly save Luffy and his crew by teleporting them away to safety from Kizaru and subsequently the New World.
By the time he entered the final phase of his Pacifista modification process, Kuma was fully convinced Luffy had all the necessary qualities to change the world due to his selfless determination to help people from tyranny, much akin to his idol Nika, thus he requested Vegapunk to program him with a mission to protect the Thousand Sunny as a last favor to the Straw Hats after losing his free will.
Two years later at the island of
Egghead
, Kuma would witness Luffy again while in his
Nika form
, having his belief on the boy confirmed.
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
Kuma admitted that he was impressed with
Roronoa Zoro
still being alive following the events at Thriller Bark, as he genuinely did not expect the swordsman to survive taking Luffy's own pain (admitting the latter's pain was enough to him unconscious).
Zoro, too, recognized and respected Kuma’s strength, admitting that he was only alive because of the other’s honor and mercy.
World Government and Marines
[
]
Kuma has always had a hostile relationship with the World Government, having been enslaved by them at a young age solely for being born to a
buccaneer
father
and losing a beloved
friend
to the whims of the World Nobles. Moreover, King
Bekori
of Sorbet, who enjoyed political support from the World Government, was frequently a thorn at Kuma's side, either through the use of smear campaigns or direct assaults towards Sorbet's more vulnerable population. Kuma became a revolutionary exactly to fight what he believed to be an unjust system propped up by hatred and corruption.
In spite of his extremely antagonistic history with the World Government, the institution acknowledged Kuma's power and reputation as a pirate, which meant that they were willing to aid Kuma in his quest to save Bonney as long as he became their loyal tool as one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
. Because Vegapunk was the only person that could cure her and he worked for the World Government, Kuma had no choice but to submit himself to highly detrimental conditions that essentially stripped him of his own body, mind and soul, all so he could receive legal authorization for his daughter's surgical operation. Furthermore, Kuma was forbidden from ever meeting Bonney after the surgery's conclusion, under the threat of having her enslaved in that case. To further ensure Kuma's loyalty, Bonney was kept under the watch of
Cipher Pol
agents during the final phases of her treatment, although the government at least honored Kuma's request to have the child returned to her homeland at Sorbet. Kuma also had a self-destructing mechanism installed within his body at Saturn's request, although Vegapunk had managed to secretly alter it to only shut down Kuma's vitals.
The other Warlords generally had diverging opinions about Kuma.
Crocodile
and
Boa Hancock
both did not show interest on him, while
Donquixote Doflamingo
did due to their shared status as
pirate
royals
, a connection that was also not lost on
Jinbe
.
Kuma unsettled with the Pacifista Project.
Prior to his final modifications, Kuma publicly claimed to follow the
World Government
. However, he refused to cooperate with the
Marines
unless given direct orders by his government superiors to do so.
Moria
once stated that because of Kuma's perceived allegiance to the World Government, he worried him more than any other
Warlord
.
Kuma was also shown to have command over the Pacifista units during his visit to
Sabaody Archipelago
, but did not seem to care about their presence, having no qualms in sending one away during the battle along with the rest of the
Straw Hat Pirates
. After his
Pacifista
upgrades
were completed, Kuma became a slave to both the World Government and Marines alike, doing whatever he was commanded until his Revolutionary Army colleagues freed him.
Kuma being restrained by Mary Geoise's security.
Between the abolition of the Seven Warlord system and his liberation from Mary Geoise, Kuma is now technically an enemy of the government once again despite his current mindless state. When Kuma returned to Mary Geoise by his own volition, the resident soldiers attempted to restrain him, with Kuma defending himself by causing major damage to the city. Sakazuki claimed that, since Kuma was no longer under the control of the government, he could no longer let the former Warlord to roam free and do as he pleased, and with the World Nobles further pressuring him, he had no other choice but to attempt to eliminate Kuma.
Borsalino
[
]
Kuma met
Kizaru
four years ago at Vegapunk's lab, as the latter brought a fleet of marines to surround it due to orders from Saturn. The Admiral was present during the conversation regarding Kuma having to join the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
and accept to become a human weapon for the government. Kizaru was visibly distraught on hearing Kuma agree to these terms as it would mean effectively losing all free will. As part of the deal, Kizaru stayed at Vegapunk's lab as Kuma and Bonney underwent their procedures, overseeing them.
For the following six months, Kuma and Kizaru grew close as they worked to build up Vegapunk's lab, partied and ate pizza alongside Bonney, Vegapunk and Sentomaru. After the procedures were done and Kuma's status as Warlord became official, however, their relationship grew sourer based on Kizaru's reaction to Kuma's presence on the
Sabaody Archipelago
. Upon seeing Kuma interfere with the PX-1 Unit, Kizaru questioned Kuma, who replied to the Admiral that his pact and loyalties were with the World Government and, as such, he did not have any obligation to explain his motives to the Marines.
Kuma and Kizaru became enemies the following two years after, with Kizaru deciding that with Kuma's presence on Egghead, he and his daughter needed to be eliminated, following Saturn's orders to kill them both.
Dr. Vegapunk
[
]
Kuma and Vegapunk during an experiment.
Kuma seems to have a good enough relationship with
Vegapunk
, who always showed interest in Kuma's unique buccaneer physique. Vegapunk highly respects Kuma as a friend, as he modified the Warlord to be the prototype Pacifista while letting him act against the World Government's interests (like granting him his final wish as a human being, which was to program Kuma to protect the Straw Hats' ship until their return).
Kuma first learned about Vegapunk from Dragon, who had connections with the scientist since his
Freedom Fighters
days and was responsible for directing Kuma himself to him. Because of this, Kuma came to fully trust Vegapunk despite his eccentricities and plans to improve the Marines' military strength, knowing that Dragon trusted him as well. Since Vegapunk was the man who saved Bonney's life, Kuma is immensely indebted to him.
That said, Bonney herself thought Vegapunk to be at fault for wiping away Kuma's mind. However, the truth was the opposite; Vegapunk was always against doing such a thing, considering it an inhumane act that the government had forced on him to carry out on Kuma. For this reason, Kuma's unexpected, but selfless acceptance of what was essentially a death sentence to himself shocked and moved Vegapunk to tears.
Vegapunk has conducted several experiments on Kuma, including one where the latter was requested to materialize his memories through his own Devil Fruit abilities for Vegapunk to study. While Kuma at first refused, he eventually complied and allowed Vegapunk access to his now tangible memories. Vegapunk, out of respect, keeps Kuma's memories locked up inside a high-security room within his laboratory.
Sentomaru
[
]
Kuma met
Sentomaru
when he first visited Vegapunk at Egghead. Because Sentomaru would often (unwillingly) play with Bonney while Kuma talked with Vegapunk, he became friends with him as well. Sentomaru was also familiar enough with Kuma's Devil Fruit ability to have a gist about how it worked, despite treating some of its specific usages as rumors.
Still, Sentomaru was always distrustful of Kuma because of his confusing allegiances and actions (especially in the
Sabaody Archipelago
), and occasionally addressed him as "Kuma-kou"
(
くま公
,
Kuma-kō
?
)
, an honorific meant as a sarcastic and insulting way of addressing someone. Despite this however he offered a silent prayer to Kuma when time came for Vegapunk to erase his memories and free will. Following the two years since the Summit War of Marineford, Sentomaru seemingly remained unaware of Kuma's intentions when the latter decided to protect the
Thousand Sunny
through that time period thanks to a prior deal he had struck with Vegapunk, implying that he was kept in the dark about the scientist's involvement.
Enemies
[
]
World Nobles
[
]
As a child slave of the
World Nobles
, Kuma was endlessly abused and paraded around for his buccaneer strength. It was because of the nobles that Kuma lost both his parents, which filled him with despair. Kuma was considered a problematic, but still valuable slave, which was enough to force him into the
Native Hunting Competition
held at God Valley.
Due to his current emotionless and inhuman state, he became a slave-to-rent for the World Nobles, as a punishment for him aiding the Straw Hat Pirates.
Seeing him unable to cry or scream regardless of injuries, the Celestial Dragons heavily abused him for their own pleasure, referring to him as a top-class slave until his eventual rescue. Due to his later arrival at Mary Geoise, where he damaged a good portion of the city and injured a few of them, many of the World Nobles ordered his execution by Sakazuki.
Jaygarcia Saturn
[
]
Kuma being attacked by Saturn.
Jaygarcia Saturn
of the
Five Elders
can be best described as the 'devil' in Kuma's life, being largely responsible for most of the suffering Kuma has been forced to endure in his life. Kuma first met the elderly World Noble during the
God Valley Incident
, when he was merely nine years old. Saturn was seemingly already familiar with Kuma back then due to his
buccaneer
heritage and went on to confront the boy personally after he ate the
Nikyu Nikyu no Mi
.
According to Saturn, Kuma's enslavement is historically justified due to his race having committed an unknown crime long ago. Kuma, however, defied Saturn's way of thinking, declaring that no one can be born a slave and that he would model himself after the legendary
Nika
, saving the oppressed with the powers he had received. This response only reinforced Saturn's views that buccaneers had to be erased for good, telling Kuma his only options were to live as a slave or die.
Years later, Saturn would start hearing about Kuma more frequently, as a revolutionary and as king of Sorbet. He also discovered the secret deal he tried to arrange with Vegapunk to save Bonney's life. Being against negotiating with pirates and spending Marine resources on saving a single girl, Saturn tried to make the most of this opportunity by having Kuma become a powerful tool for the government, enforcing several conditions he had to follow in order to ensure his obedience to the institution in the long term; including having his free will removed during his conversion into a Pacifista. Moreover, Saturn requested Vegapunk to implant a self-destruct system within Kuma's modifications in case they ever lost control of him, much to Vegapunk's protest.
Despite having his free will removed, it appeared Kuma still retained key memories of his life and was aware of Saturn's presence on Egghead and that he was endangering his daughter. This led Kuma to retaliate after years of abuse and persecution and strike Saturn with a devastating punch.
Saturn grew confused and furious at how this was possible and decided to kill Kuma with his own hands.
Other
[
]
Gecko Moria
[
]
Gecko Moria
feels that because of Kuma's apparent loyalty to the World Government, he could not be trusted and admitted that the Tyrant worried him more than any other Warlord. Moria also thought very little of Kuma's own Devil Fruit abilities back when the latter was accepted in the group, although he would later learn about their full potential somehow.
During the
Thriller Bark Arc
, Kuma met with Moria to inform him about
Marshall D. Teach
's acceptance into the Seven Warlords of the Sea, and also warn him about the government's concerns that Moria could potentially lose against the
Straw Hat Pirates
. As such, Kuma offered his assistance to the
Thriller Bark Pirates
in order to take down Luffy and his crew, but Moria, with his pride on the line, rejected this offer and even screamed back at Kuma for implying that he was not capable of doing the job himself.
Marshall D. Teach
[
]
Kuma has not met
Blackbeard
directly but showed to have prior knowledge of him before he was elected as a Warlord. Despite his unknown bounty, he knew about his past history as a member of the
Whitebeard Pirates
and was opposed to his appointment, showing his doubts over the matter. Kuma's doubts would prove correct, as Blackbeard used his position as a Warlord to invade
Impel Down
and recruit Level 6 prisoners to strengthen his crew.
Bekori
[
]
Because of
Bekori
's unfair policies that targeted the vulnerable elderly population of Sorbet, Kuma became an enemy of the Sorbet king. During an incident where some villagers that Kuma took care of were kidnapped by the kingdom's royal army, Kuma began a fight with the kidnapping soldiers and caused mass destruction to Sorbet's Castle Town, leading to his imprisonment as well as that of Ginny and some of Kuma's other friends who protested for his release. After Bekori's forceful dethronement by the
Freedom Fighters
, Kuma joined the organization.
Years later, when Bekori returned to Sorbet to continue with his atrocious policies, Kuma singlehandedly defeated the previously deposed king and his forces. This caused Bekori to seek direct support from the
World Government
, starting a smear campaign against Kuma, the newly elected king of Sorbet. The propaganda directly attributed Bekori's own violent acts to Kuma's doing, while painting Bekori as an unfairly ousted leader who sought to recover his rightful nation.
Kuma and Bekori met for the last time at sea, where the latter, with the support of a Marine fleet, attempted to kill the former and regain Sorbet's crown. Kuma, however, was able to take down the fleet with little trouble, stopping Bekori for good.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Kuma shows up by himself to liberate the country of Tumi.
Prior to his final
Pacifista
modifications, Kuma was a soldier in the
Revolutionary Army
and among its strongest and most effective fighters, as he could easily revert an unfavorable confrontation of national proportions by himself. As an officer-ranked fighter, he had control over its lower ranking members. However, he surrendered this control when he left the Revolutionary Army.
As the former king of the
Sorbet Kingdom
, he once held political power, however, Kuma himself only chose to rule due to popular demand, having no actual skill in governing a country, and as such gave much of his political power and responsibilities to one of the kingdom's previous rulers,
Bulldog
, effectively making himself a political figurehead. Nonetheless, the population still saw Kuma as their rightful ruler, and many citizens respected him as such, even after he returned to his life as a priest. When the previous ruler and tyrant,
Bekori
, returned in another attempt to take back the kingdom, Kuma fully abdicated from the throne and declared Bulldog as the official ruler, officially becoming a wanted pirate after confronting Bekori.
During his days as a pirate, Kuma was considered a powerful and dangerous man, to the point of escaping and destroying entire marine fleets, stopping multiple bounty hunters, and gaining a fast-spreading reputation among other pirates as an unstoppable menace. His reputation became so well known that the World Government recognized him as a fitting candidate for the position as one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, an offer that Kuma took as part of an agreement he made with
Jaygarcia Saturn
of the
Five Elders
to ensure Bonney's Sapphire Scales treatment. What made this even more impressive is the fact that Kuma achieved this reputation solo, without the assistance of a crew. This makes him, as well as fellow Warlord
Dracule Mihawk
, the only two known single-person pirate crews in the entire series.
Kuma is one of the few people to have completely defeated the
Straw Hat Pirates
and is also the only character introduced so far that has defeated the crew single-handedly, twice. However, the crew was extremely weak and injured both times and they were in no shape to fight another battle, much less a Warlord (in the first encounter, the crew had just finished battling another Warlord of the Sea,
Gecko Moria
, as well as an island full of
zombies
and a giant zombie named
Oars
; in the second encounter, they had just battled against a Pacifista while fending off a second, alongside
Sentomaru
and Marine
Admiral
Kizaru
). He did not want the crew dead, however, since he allowed them to escape, indicating he wasn't fighting them at full strength.
Kuma has such a fierce reputation that even other powerful and famous pirates are unnerved by him, as seen when the captain of the
Kid Pirates
,
Eustass Kid
, seemed heavily disturbed when he witnessed the arrival of a Pacifista (mistaking it for the real Kuma) on the
Sabaody Archipelago
, despite the fact that his bounty was higher than Kuma's former one.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Kuma was born as a member of the extant
Buccaneers
race; a race said to carry the blood of
Giants
within them, having inherited his size and great physical strength and durability from his father
Clapp
; who was a full-blooded Buccaneer. Despite being only half-buccaneer on his father's side, Kuma has inherited the majority of the physical traits and abilities attributed to the Buccaneers, as he was incredibly strong even as a child, and withstood the harshest of punishments, beatings, and the overall lifestyle of enslavement by the Celestial Dragons even at such a young age. It is currently unknown how exactly durable and powerful Kuma's body was before he began the process of becoming a cyborg, but in his past, he was known to be quite fearsome even before becoming a revolutionary.
After fully becoming a Pacifista, Kuma's physical abilities were enhanced further as a complete cyborg. He was able to protect the
Thousand Sunny
from being damaged or touched by attackers for two entire years, and his body withstood two years' worth of damage as he waited for one of the Straw Hats to return. He could now take the harsh treatment and enslavement of the Celestial Dragons without feeling any pain at all, to the point where he could still move perfectly fine even after being stabbed with a multitude of swords and was visibly and heavily damaged and in need of repairs. This led to the Celestial Dragons identifying Kuma as their so-called "Invincible Slave".
After being freed and repaired by the Revolutionaries, Kuma maintained enough strength and durability to send himself back to the Sabaody Archipelago, and then began climbing the Red Line itself to return to Mary Geoise, withstanding multiple onslaughts of attacks from the Marines. Despite the damage his body took just to successfully climb up to Mary Geoise, Kuma was more than strong enough to fight off Mary Geoise's guards, and even managed to devastate the whole area with his powers before Fleet Admiral Sakazuki finally showed up to stop him. Despite losing part of his face and one of his feet to him, Kuma was able to avoid capture and destruction, and escape before further damage was done.
Once arriving to Egghead, he took a hit from Saturn's clawed foot while protecting Bonney, which while inflicting another grievous injury onto him, Kuma gathered enough strength to throw a very powerful Armament Haki-infused punch, sending the Elder crashing through several buildings and tearing off his arm and horn.
Geographical Knowledge
[
]
Kuma appears to have great knowledge in geography, as he knows exactly where he is sending someone through his powers, no matter in which part of the world he currently is. Part of this is due to his days traveling to a multitude of various islands searching for a cure for his daughter. His degree of spatial knowledge is high enough to perfectly locate even a moving sky island.
Kuma is seemingly a skilled navigator as well, having travelled through a good portion of the
Grand Line
by his sole self, while in a small boat.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Nikyu Nikyu no Mi
Kuma reveals his Devil Fruit ability.
Thirty-eight years ago, Kuma ate the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that gave him paw pads on the palms of his hands; these paw pads have the power to repel anything they come into contact with. His paw pads grant him an absolute defense that allows him to protect himself from all physical attacks, even swords. This ability, coupled with his vast reaction speed, allows him to repel attacks from extremely quick opponents, such as
Luffy
in
Gear 2
. He can also use his paws to attack by repelling his target at great speed. By Kuma's own admission, his paw pads repel things at the speed of light.
Kuma compressing air.
His palm strikes are able to deal significant damage to his enemies, due his repelling power subjecting his target to a severe level of force. Additionally, his power to repel is not just strong, it is also focused into a cannon-like blast, enough to create a deep hole through thick stone. His paw strikes can also travel beyond the target, dealing identical damage to anything behind them as well. Kuma can even repel the air itself, attacking his opponent with a cannon-like shockwave. He can also compress an immense amount of air between his hands into a single small bubble, and then release the air bubble, which explodes as a super-massive shockwave that can decimate an entire island.
Interestingly, he can repel all the pain, injury, and exhaustion out of a person's body, allowing him to completely heal people in an instant, even if they have suffered an incredibly severe level of damage. Once the pain is expelled from the person's body, it takes the form of a paw-shaped bubble, the greater damage that was removed, the larger the bubble will be. The damage can be transferred into another person's body, causing them a great deal of suffering all at once.
Possibly the most impressive application of this fruit is that Kuma can send someone flying over vast distances, even across the world and traveling over the course of several days. The victim of this ability is encased in a paw bubble that protects them from and breaks through any obstacles that are in the way of the destination of Kuma's choosing. To an outside observer, the victim appears to vanish.
Pacifista Modifications
[
]
Further information:
Pacifista
Kuma's multiple cybernetic enhancements on his body,  exposed after being wounded by the Marines.
Kuma is now a
cyborg
modified by
Vegapunk
. He is, however, very different from other cyborgs, and displays strength and agility that are on a different scale.
As with the other
Pacifista
models, Kuma has a built-in electronic recognition device within his pupils, which enables him to accurately identify certain individuals (presumably anybody that is listed within the
World Government
's bounty system) and their bounty count from across a distance of several dozen meters. Kuma is also equipped with augmented hearing, allowing him to pick up any sounds at a greater range than normal.
Kuma's massive build along with his cybernetic enhancements grants him tremendous durability and strength comparable if not superior to other Pacifista; the average Pacifista model is capable of withstanding a combination assault from the pre-timeskip Monster Trio. At
Thriller Bark
, he effortlessly lifted a large slab of rubble with a single hand and his body was resilient enough to withstand most physical attacks, including
Sanji
's "Concasser" (in fact, Sanji injured his leg after delivering the blow, despite it being strong enough to stun a
user
of
Tekkai
) and even
Zoro
's "Shishi Sonson", a technique that was able to cut through steel, which only left a scratch on Kuma despite it being a surprise attack.
Emporio Ivankov
's "Galaxy Wink" appeared to inflict no substantial damage upon Kuma, despite the barrage of attacks being powerful enough to knock him off his feet.
Kuma firing a laser beam from his mouth.
Even after two years of accumulated damage, lack of repair, and lack of sustenance intake, Kuma was still operational. While the modifications gave Kuma great strength, their full completion over a long time period apparently robbed Kuma of his free will.
Due to technically having his mind removed, Kuma does not feel any pain. While being enslaved by the World Nobles, Kuma was constantly and brutally abused by the World Nobles without feeling any discomfort, not even reacting as
Rosward
struck his head hard with a hammer and stabbed him with a sword. He has multiple swords stabbed inside his body and continues to function without succumbing to the accumulated damage.
As a Pacifista, Kuma has the ability to shoot
laser
beams, which not only causes massive explosions upon detonation, but can also melt steel. This laser is apparently a replication of
Kizaru
's
Pika Pika no Mi
powers and for Kuma, this launcher is only installed in his mouth. In the other Pacifista, the launcher is installed on their palms as well. Kuma has his
paw pads
instead of the laser holes on his hands; it is this aspect, along with the bible that only he holds, even after losing his free will, that distinguishes him from the other Pacifista, and makes him superior to them. However, he seems to possess gloves that allow him to shoot lasers from his palms, as he was about to demonstrate during
Charlos
's second attempt to kidnap
Shirahoshi
.
Haki

]

Haki
Armament Haki

]

Kuma possesses the ability to use
Armament Haki
and can utilize it to harden his fist, boosting the power of his punches.
With one Haki-infused punch, Kuma was able to knock
Jaygarcia Saturn
off his feet and send him crashing into several buildings.
Observation Haki
[
]
He is also able to use
Observation Haki
.
Ships
[
]
Kuma's ship as a Warlord.
After becoming a pirate, Kuma had possession of at least three different ships. Initially, he had a rather small ship with two sails which barely had room to accommodate him. His subsequent ship was slighly larger, but only had one sail.
Finally, after becoming a
Warlord of the Sea
, he had a larger and more personalized ship with at least five sails, one at the front featuring his
Jolly Roger
(based on a drawing from Bonney
). The keel of the ship had a dot pattern similar to Kuma's hat and pants, the sides featured ornaments similar to his bear ears, and there was church-like structure on board with a cross at the top.
He did not appear to have any crew aboard his ships at any point other than himself.

Early Concepts
[
]
Kuma's concept in One Piece Green.
In an interview about
Strong World
, Oda revealed that he originally intended the steering wheel in the head concept of
Shiki
to be used on Kuma. He turned down the idea and decided later to use it for Shiki.
According to an interview in
One Piece Magazine Vol.2
, Oda already intended for Kuma to separate the Straw Hats since his debut.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Appearance
[
]
In the manga also, Kuma was intended to have a different color scheme than the one he is presented with in the anime. This unfortunately was because no full colored version of Kuma was present when the first episode of him appearing was made. The anime had Kuma with a black jacket while Oda's intentions were an orange one. The manga however later changed this color scheme to resemble that of the anime.
In the manga and
One Piece: Unlimited Cruise
, Kuma's paw pads are black, like a bear's. However, in the anime, the paw pads are pink, like a cat's (which may play off a concept in Robin's head of Kuma's Devil Fruit reminding her of a cat's pads).
Jaya Arc
[
]
During the meeting in Mary Geoise in the manga, Kuma had a few lines, but in the anime, he had none.
Post-War Arc
[
]
In the manga, during the flashback where Dragon saves the people of the Grey Terminal from a fire, Kuma's clothing underneath the common Revolutionary Army cloak was not shown. In the anime, it is revealed that Kuma had the same clothing then that he does now.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
During the flashback of Sabo's past, the anime shows Kuma being present in the training of Sabo where Kuma deflected Sabo after he tried to attack him.
