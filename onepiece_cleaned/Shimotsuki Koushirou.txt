Shimotsuki Koushirou
is a member of the
Shimotsuki Family
and a master
swordsman
, he was both the teacher of as well as the distant relative of
Roronoa Zoro

Appearance
[
]
Koushirou has black hair tied back in a long ponytail, his face is wrinkled and wears glasses with circular frames. He always wears a gray yukata and sometimes he has a beige haori over it with two crossed swords on the left breast.
Personality
[
]
He was a believer that females are naturally weaker than their male counterparts and are therefore unsuitable to be warriors.
Koushirou deeply appreciates talent as shown when he noted that as long as
Zoro
valued his
swordsmanship
, he did not care if he had become a
pirate
.
However, he was rather dismayed that the students of his dojo hoped to become great pirates like Zoro and started practicing Three Sword Style to better emulate him.
Although he is always seen smiling, he gives the impression of being a mostly emotionless person. Koushirou's reaction to his
daughter
's death was just a comment that "humans are fragile" when telling Zoro that she died, though it is possible that he could have been masking his pain.

,

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Koushirou was born in
Shimotsuki Village
in the
East Blue
to
Shimotsuki Kouzaburou
and an Unnamed woman, 51 years before the current story line.
Two years after
Gol D. Roger
's execution,  Koushirou, now 29, and his wife had a daughter named
Kuina
, Koushirou expressed concern whether a girl would be capable of taking over his dojo, to which his wife reassured him that their daughter would grow to be strong.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
One day, a young
Zoro
came to his dojo for a challenge. His terms were to fight with Koushirou, and that if he won, he would own the dojo. However, if he lost, he would become a student there. Koushirou, deciding not to fight Zoro himself, pitted Zoro against his daughter Kuina. Zoro accepted the change in the duel. Zoro lost to Kuina, and became Koushirou's student as agreed.
One night, Koushirou discussed about Zoro's progress with a fellow teacher and was confident that Zoro would one day surpass Kuina. Kuina, having overheard this conversation, became outraged saying that she would be the world's greatest
swordsman
. Koushirou stated that as a woman, Kuina could never be the greatest swordsman, causing her to be distraught.
Concludes non-canon section.
At least once,
Isshin Dojo
helped the
Revolutionary Army
by providing them food and supplies. A
man with a large face
was seen and
Monkey D. Dragon
said that the army received food from the dojo.
At one point Zoro came to Koushirou asking if it was true if there were swordsmen that could cut through anything and even steel to which he confirmed. He then demonstrated to Zoro a piece of paper that he did not have the will to cut, explaining to the boy that part of swordsmanship lies within a sword understanding the will of what the swordsman wishes to protect and what and when he wishes to cut, further explaining to Zoro that a sword that cuts and injures anything it touches isn't a real sword.
One day Koushirou went to check on Zoro after he had lost to Kuina for the 2000th time, Zoro questioned why he still could not win against her to which Koushirou suggested it could be due to their age difference to which Zoro denies as he was able to defeat adults. On the day after Zoro and Kuina made their vow, Kuina fell down the stairs and died. At Zoro's request, Koushirou gave him her
Meito
,
Wado Ichimonji
.

Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
After the
Enies Lobby
incident, Koushirou was seen again in his dojo when his students were asking him about Zoro. He wished Zoro to go on ahead and fulfill his dream. Koushirou also stated that as long as Zoro treasures his
sword
, it will not matter what person he becomes.
From the Decks of the World
[
]
After the news of the
Straw Hat Pirates
spread across the world, Koushirou smiled and put a copy of the newspaper on Kuina's grave.
From the Decks of the World: The 500,000,000 Man Arc
[
]
After the Straw Hats' victory at
Dressrosa
, Koushirou was dismayed that his young students began to imitate Zoro by practicing
Three Sword Style
and taping their left eyes shut.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
Koushirou is seen at the dojo listening to
Vegapunk
's worldwide broadcast. As Vegapunk tells everyone about how different the world's landmasses once were, Koushirou is seen with a worried, confused expression at the news.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Koushirou with graying hair in the anime.
At the end of the
anime
's flashback of
Zoro
's past, Koushirou was shown with bits of gray hair when Zoro left
Shimotsuki Village
.
Yet, his hair was fully black when Zoro received his second
bounty
. This is most likely due to him not yet having been seen outside of Zoro's flashback in the
manga
at the time.
In the manga, his actions are limited to Zoro's flashback while in the anime his role is expanded.
Shimotsuki Kuina
's increased fighting potential is noted by him because of her rivalry with Zoro, while in the manga he makes no statement. His traditional values are also touched upon as he contemplated making Zoro his heir rather than his own daughter Kuina, simply because of her gender.
