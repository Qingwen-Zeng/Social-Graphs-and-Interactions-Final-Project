Not to be confused with
Hatchan
.
Hatcha
is a member of the
Numbers
in the
Beasts Pirates
, representing the number "eight".
Due to his actions and role, he is a minor antagonist in the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Hatcha's concept art from the anime.
Like the other Numbers, Hatcha is an enormous humanoid much larger than a typical
giant
, standing at a height of 66.8 meters.
Like his fellow Numbers and most of the Beasts Pirates in general, Hatcha has a pair of horns atop his head. While some of the other Numbers have more animal-like features, Hatcha looks very humanoid, having peach skin, a set of rounded teeth and indigo hair arranged in a bowl cut. On the left side of his abdomen is a tattoo of the
daiji
"捌", which means eight.
He wears a yellow track-jacket that remains unzipped, leaving his bare chest exposed, dark pants and light shoes with laces. He also possesses a pair of oval sunglasses.
Personality
[
]
Hatcha going on a rampage.
Like the other Numbers, Hatcha likes to drink. He seems to like fighting and quickly took the opportunity to attack Luffy, Zoro, Kid, and Killer when they broke into Kaidou's fortress, with his careless use of force resulting in collateral damage and members of his own crew going down. This recklessness caused his crewmates to try and stop him from attacking further, and Kid noted that they seemed to have trouble controlling him.
Hatcha is attracted to the
General Franky
, seeming to view it as a toy and preferring to chase after it rather than fight his crew's enemies.
Like the other Numbers, Hatcha has a unique
laughter style
that plays off his name and the number eight: "Hachachacha"
(
ハチャチャチャ
?
)
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Due to his large size, Hatcha is extremely powerful, wielding his club to strike heavy blows.
After somewhat sobering up, Hatcha was able to lift his fellow Number
Jaki
over his head with ease.
The
gigantification
experiments also granted him a long lifespan akin to genuine giants, as he is currently 188 years old.
Weapons
[
]
Hatcha wields a massive, spiked club resembling a
morning star
, suiting his size. With casual swings he can easily crush, as well as blow large holes into thick layers of, stone and wooden floor.
History
[

Past
[
]
Over 20 years ago, Hatcha was a subject in an experiment on
Punk Hazard
that attempted to
recreate the ancient giants
. The experiment was a failure, but Hatcha and his fellow test subjects were recruited by
Kaidou
. They began residing on
Onigashima
and joined Kaidou's crew, the
Beasts Pirates
, as a group called the
Numbers
.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Five days before the
Fire Festival
, the Numbers arrived in
Hakumai
via Mogura Port and headed toward
Onigashima
with
Scratchmen Apoo
.
On the day of the Fire Festival, Hatcha and the Numbers took part in the Beasts Pirates' Golden Kagura festivities.
Later, the enemy pirates
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Roronoa Zoro
,
Eustass Kid
, and
Killer
were spotted and identified in the fortress, and when
Queen
gave the pirates permission to kill them, a drunken Hatcha stepped in and wildly attacked with his club, causing heavy collateral damage as his crewmates told him to stop.
Hatcha knocked out by Yamato's attack.
After he sobered up, Hatcha began obsessively chasing after
General Franky
, as
Franky
immediately left to head outside the Skull Dome per
Jinbe
's instructions to draw Hatcha away.
Hatcha chased Franky to where
Yamato
,
Shinobu
,
Momonosuke
, and
Sasaki
's Armored Corps were, and tried attacking Franky with his club, causing the floor to fall out from under them. However, Yamato unleashed a
powerful long-range attack
that struck Hatcha under the chin, knocking him out.
