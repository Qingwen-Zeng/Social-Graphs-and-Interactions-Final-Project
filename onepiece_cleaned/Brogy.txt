Brogy the Red Ogre
is a
giant
from
Elbaph
and one of the two
captains
of the
Giant Warrior Pirates
alongside
Dorry
. He is a major ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Little Garden
,
Egghead
, and
Elbaph
Arcs.
Appearance
[
]
Brogy is a giant who dresses in a Viking attire, which consists of a red overall with golden button straps, fur linings, a leather strap around his right shoulder and another as a belt, yellow pants with black stripes and fur linings at the bottom, yellow shoes, and a red helmet with two horns. Brogy has a blond beard shaped like an axe's blade, beady eyes, a wide grin, and a pig-like nose.
Personality
[
]
Like
Dorry
, Brogy is a good natured giant, however, his pride can sometimes get the best of him. He is a firm believer of the customs of fighting from his homeland and follows them with much honor. He would follow these even if he were severely wounded. Despite seemingly defeating Dorry after so long, Brogy did not feel any happiness when he sensed something was wrong during their battle that Mr. 3 interfered with.
Brogy has his own
unique laugh
: "Gaba" (i.e. Gababababababa!).
Relationships

Dorry and Brogy fighting.
Brogy is
Dorry
's best friend. However because of the argument they had 100 years ago, they were engaged in a life and death battle against each other as per their homeland's customs. Despite this however, they are still the best of friends and deeply respect each other. Dorry and Brogy's competitive relationship with one another is comparable to that of
Zoro
and
Sanji
.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
He befriends the
Straw Hat Pirates
during their stay in
Little Garden
. He inspires
Usopp
to want to travel to
Elbaph
someday.
Two years later, Brogy and Dorry headed to
Egghead
to help the Straw Hat Pirates. They are also aware that
Luffy
is
Nika
.
Shanks
[
]
Brogy and Dorry are old friends of
Shanks
as well calling the Emperor as "brother". Brogy and Dorry aid Shanks against the Kid Pirates.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Initially, Brogy had a bounty of
100,000,000 on his head, an indication of his danger. Moreover, like other giants, he possesses superhuman strength and resistance. However, having been one of the two
captains
of the
Giant Warrior Pirates
, he was extremely strong even compared to the other individuals of his
race
and had authority over one of the strongest crews in the
world
. After the Egghead Incident, Brogy’s bounty jumped to
1,800,000,000.
As a demonstration of his strength, he fought on a par with
Dorry
for a hundred years and together with the latter he managed to defeat such
great creatures
that not even the other giants of their crew would have been able to capture.
The strength of the two giants is in fact such that
Galdino
, a member of
Baroque Works
who is capable of defeating a
pirate
with a
bounty
of
42,000,000, said he could in no way defeat them without resorting to deception, even with the help from
Miss Golden Week
,
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
Brogy has a strong will and was capable of resisting a powerful blast of
Topman Warcury
's
Supreme King Haki
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Brogy resorting to unarmed combat.
As a Giant, Brogy has immense physical strength. He is capable of defeating even a
Marine
Vice-Admiral with relative ease. Together with Dorry, Brogy was able to injure and fight off
two
members
of the
Five Elders
.
Brogy is capable of easily killing the
dinosaurs
of
Little Garden
, prey he hunts daily, even remaining virtually impassive to their bite.
Together with Dorry he also managed to pierce the
Island Eater
, despite the great distance that separated them. Even
Luffy
, after seeing them perform this feat, stated that the two were monstrously powerful.
Brogy's strength is also such as to allow him to free himself from Galdino's
wax
, despite being as hard as steel.
Weapons
[
]
Further information:
Bruiser Axe
In combat, Brogy used a shield and a battle axe. His previous axe was called the
Bruiser Axe
,
but after a hundred years of battle, the blade lost its sharpness and eventually broke. Brogy later replaced it with a new axe. With an axe, he can launch a Flying Slash Attack, powerful enough to kill the Island Eater.
Techniques
[
]
Hakoku
(
覇国
,
Hakoku
?
, literally meaning "Warrior Nation")
: Putting all of their strength into it,
Dorry
and Brogy each call upon
Elbaph
's "warrior code", and slash their weapons at the ocean, creating two compressed air beams (Dorry's is blue, while Brogy's is red) that will slice through anything in their path, even the ocean itself. However, the amount of power needed for this attack proved to be too much for the giants' rusty weapons, so both
Dorry's sword
and this axe shattered. The only thing they are incapable of piercing is the "bloodstained snake"
(
血に染まるヘビ
,
chi ni somaru hebi
?
)
.
In the Viz Manga and Funimation subs, this is called
Hakoku Sovereignty
.
Taiyo Noko
(
太陽鋸
,
Taiyō Noko
?
, literally meaning "Sun Saw")
:
Dorry
and Brogy stand on opposite sides of their opponent and strike simultaneously. Dorry uses his sword to slash through their neck while Brogy uses his axe to slash their torso, cutting their enemy in three. This attack was first used against
Shepherd Ju Peter
in his Sandworm form.
The name of the attack is pronounced Taiyōnoko, rather than the standard Taiyō Nokogiri
(
太陽鋸
?
)
, leading it to sound like "Child of the Sun"
(
太陽の子
,
Taiyō no Ko
?
)
. In the Viz Manga, this is called
Sun Saw
.
Svalinn
(
太陽の盾
,
Suvarin
?
, literally meaning "Sun-Shield")
: Brogy and Dorry stand next to each other and use their shields to parry an attack together. This technique was first used against
Topman Warcury
in his Fengxi form.
The technique is named after
Svalinn
, a legendary shield from Nordic mythology which stands in front of the sun. In the Viz Manga, this is called
Svalinn Sun-Shield
.
Skilja
(
隔
,
Sukīruda
?
, literally meaning "Separate")
: After parrying an attack, Brogy and Dorry punch in opposite directions with their shield-wielding arms and strike the enemy back.
"Skilja" means "separate" in many Scandinavian languages. In the Viz Manga, this is called
Skilja Split
.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Brogy and Dorry are posed a question.
Brogy, along with
Dorry
, were once two of the most feared pirates in the world as no one could bring them down. One day on a hunting trip, each had slayed a massive
Sea King
. Then, while they were celebrating their great catches,
a little girl
asked them both which Sea King was bigger. They could not agree on which one was bigger, so, as per the rules of
Elbaph
, they started to duel on
Little Garden
.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Little Garden Arc
[
]
One hundred years passed, and their Sea Kings' corpses had turned to bones. They continued the battle every time the volcano on the island exploded, the duel always ending in a draw.
One day the
Straw Hat Pirates
arrived on the island on their way to
Arabasta
with
Vivi
. After
Luffy
and Vivi went to explore, and
Sanji
and
Zoro
went to find food,
Nami
and
Usopp
were left on the
Going Merry
to fend for themselves. Meanwhile Brogy was exploring and came across the Going Merry and scared Nami and Usopp half to death.
Nami and Usopp thought Brogy was going to eat them, but he just wanted some alcohol, which they gave him. As a dinosaur stumbled upon them, Brogy sliced its head off, frightening Nami and Usopp further, who then played dead, only Brogy thought they had fainted.
He then brought them to his home and started cooking for himself. Usopp and Nami panicked and ran away when he was not looking and ended up being chased by other carnivorous animals. They were saved by Brogy, who in turn provided them a large amount of dinosaur meat, but Usopp and Nami, who were still scared, tried to wait it out until the
Log Pose
set but soon found out that it would take a whole year for the log to lock onto the next island.
After the volcano exploded, Brogy and Dorry went to fight each other.
After yet another tie, the two giants returned to their camps to relax and recuperate. Elsewhere, Dorry was defeated due to the injuries he had suffered from a bomb explosion that was hidden in rum he was consuming.
Brogy fought Dorry and defeated him.
He rejoiced in victory after years of fighting.
Mr. 3
appeared and called out to Brogy that he was the one who helped him to defeat Dorry. Brogy moved to attack Mr. 3 but was suddenly held captive by
Mr. 3's wax
, which had immobilized Brogy's feet.
Soon, Luffy arrived and battled the
Baroque Works
agents to free Brogy and the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Brogy and Dorry farewell the Straw Hat Pirates.
Later, Brogy learned that Dorry had survived the fatal blow. Dorry believed that their weapons had grown old and weak over the years and were now unable to cause fatal blows.
The duo headed to the ocean to bid their new friends, the Straw Hats, farewell. They warned the pirates to continue heading straight, no matter what, as the crew disembarked from the isle. The
Island Eater
appeared to attack them, but the giants swiftly destroyed it, letting the Straw Hat Pirates keep sailing with their newly obtained Log Pose for Arabasta. The volcano erupted again for them to continue dueling, still not remembering why they do so.

Brogy was still dueling it out with Dorry two years later on Little Garden with no end in sight.

were flying in the background, suggesting that they have read about the Straw Hats' return.
Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
Brogy and Dorry sink the Victoria Punk and Kid Pirates.
Brogy was seen on Elbaph with Dorry, seemingly ending their duel, where
Shanks
asked the two of them for help with fighting
Eustass Kid
.
On Shanks's command, he and Dorry would later sink all of the
Kid Pirates
along with their
ship
with
Hakoku
and declared to them that if they came and willingly aimed a gun against someone else's land, they should be prepared to suffer the same fate.
Dorry and Brogy arrive on Egghead alongside their crew.
Sometime later, during the
Egghead Incident
, Dorry and Brogy both made their way to Egghead. Many of the Marines present on the island were left highly confused upon seeing their giant ship. Upon hearing their confusion on the topic of their arrival, Dorry and Brogy both explained that they had arrived to save Luffy, while also attacking many of the Marines.
Both captains called out to
Oimo
and
Kashii
to lead the assault around the sides of the island, and to sink any Marine ships that they spotted.
Dorry and Brogy save Luffy from Ju Peter.
They later stumbled upon
Franky
,
Atlas
,
Bonney
and
Kuma
after Brogy smacked Vice Admiral
Tosa
with his axe. They were unaware that Franky was part of the Straw Hat crew and told him they were looking for the Straw Hat Crew, though dismissed Franky's concerns that they were hostile towards them. They ordered their crew members to bring Franky's group to their ship before proceeding to make their way into the main area of the island after Bonney told them that they would find
Luffy
,
Sanji
and
Vegapunk
there.
Dorry and Brogy continued to make their way across Egghead while the
Five Elders
appeared and confronted Luffy. While facing them, Luffy was devoured whole by
Shepherd Ju Peter
. Dorry and Brogy witnessed this, and quickly made their way over. They simultaneously decapitated Ju Peter, freeing Luffy, and greeting him for the first time in two years.
Dorry and Brogy knock Warcury away.
Dorry and Brogy had a warm reception with Luffy, both glad to see him after two years. Both were also surprised to see his
Gear 5
appearance, remarking that it was identical to a God in Elbaph. Before they could leave,
Topman Warcury
confronted them, stating that escape was impossible. After disorienting them using a burst of
haki
, Warcury attempted to slice them using his sharpened tusks, prompting Dorry and Brogy to block with their shields. When questioned by Warcury on why they were bothering to help Luffy, both stated that he was their friend, before bashing Warcury away using their shields. The attempted attacks didn't end, with Saturn shooting orbs of venom at them. Luffy used his own abilities to deflect the orbs back at the Elders, causing a massive explosion. To the shock of Dorry and Brogy, the Elders simply regenerated from the damage, causing them to realize that fighting them would be fruitless.
While they retreated, Ju Peter attempted to suck them in to prevent the three from from escaping. Luffy managed to stop this by kicking a building into the Elder's mouth, but then ran out of energy and de-transformed out of his Gear 5 form. Dorry was shocked that Luffy suddenly became an old man, but Brogy offered to feed him some emergency Hakarl ration from Elbaph, which allowed Luffy to gain back his normal physique. Luffy then attempted to stop Warcury by punching him with
Red Roc
, after Dorry informed them that he was charging at them, but Luffy only hurt himself in the process due to Warcury's tough hide.
As they ran, Warcury's flames begun to catch up to Dorry and Brogy, Brogy warned Luffy that attacking Warcury would not work only form him to strike Warcury in Gear 5th form, leading Luffy to hurt his hand once more.
In the end, they decided that further attacks weren't worth it, and favored simply running.
To their luck, Warcury and Ju Peter eventually abandoned their pursuit and left to deal with more important matters, allowing the three to escape undeterred.
Luffy, Dorry, and Brogy make it back to their ship.
After running for quite some time, the trio managed to finally arrive at the Giant's ship, leaping on just as it was preparing to depart Egghead. Despite this, their success would be short-lived, as
Marcus Mars
used his flight abilities to pursue them out onto the sea. Mars fired an energy beam at the ship, and to make matters worse, the water had suddenly taken on rubber-like properties, resulting in the boat being rocked wildly. Fortunately, Luffy became reenergized after eating, and transformed into his Gear 5 form. Dorry and Brogy both began to dance afterward as the Drums of Liberation began to play.
Realizing that severity of the situation, the pair stopped dancing, instead issuing orders and moving to put out the fire that Mars had started on the ship. After Brogy issued the order to quickly move away from the coast, both giants were shocked when the
Iron Giant
suddenly reemerged from the water, striking Warcury.
Their celebrations on the assistance from the machine were quickly dashed as Saturn suddenly leaped aboard their ship, latching onto the front.
Dorry and Brogy celebrate victory with their friends.
Dorry and Brogy led their crew in the defense against Saturn, with all of the giants quickly equipping and utilizing their shields. They all stood back and cheered as Luffy and Bonney unleashed a powerful attack on Saturn, launching him back off of the ship.
Unfortunately, the onslaught of attacks continued as Peter suddenly leapt off the island, intent on using his large body to destroy the Giant's ship. Suddenly, at the same time, the Iron Giant undid a knot somewhere on its body, resulting in a massive burst of
Joy Boy
's
Haki
suddenly being unleashed upon the entire island. Dorry and Brogy were both left completely shocked and confused as the Haki forced most of the Five Elders back to Mary Geoise, knocked out most of the Marines, and made escape a much easier task.
In the aftermath, Dorry commented on the Haki possibly being stronger than Shanks'. The two then made the decision to push off of Egghead, now having the chance to flee with all of their enemies down. The pair would later start a party with their crew, Luffy, and Usopp, holding up the former as he weakly begged for them to save it until he recovered.
Elbaph Arc
[
]
Two days later, upon waking up from passing out drunk during the party, Brogy and the others discovered that Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji and Chopper along with
Sunny
were nowhere to be seen.
