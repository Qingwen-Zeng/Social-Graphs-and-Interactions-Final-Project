Past
[
]
Nokokuwa Police was stationed on
Onigashima
when
Portgas D. Ace
invaded the island four years ago. He, along with
Poker
,
Babanuki
, and
Briscola
, watched in horror as
Yamato
broke the dragon statue that symbolized
Kaidou
's power.
Wano Country Saga

Wano Country Arc
[

On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Nokokuwa Police took part in
Queen
's Golden Kagura festivities with the other
Shinuchi
.
When the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
later invaded
Onigashima
, he was among the
Gifters
who stood alongside
Scratchmen Apoo
in
Luffy
and
Zoro's
way.
Later, he again confronted
Roronoa Zoro
alongside
Kamakirigirl
and
Beetleman
.
Once the
Raid on Onigashima
was fully underway, Nokokuwa Police rejoined the
Armored Division
. Targeting
Momonosuke
, who was being protected by
Shinobu
, he participated in the initial firing round, hitting Shinobu.
After
Yamato
began defending Momonosuke,
the entire division surrounded the three of them and fired shots from behind their shields. However, Yamato continued blocking the shots and taking down more of their members, until the fight was eventually interrupted by the arrival of
Franky
and
Hatcha
. The
Number
smashed a hole through the floor, and the trio escaped,
with Franky staying behind to occupy the Armored Division.
During Franky's fight with Sasaki,
Tama
, with help from
Usopp
, was able to tame the Armored Division and led them to the Live Floor.
After Tama gave her order for her friends to help the Straw Hats, Nokokuwa Police led the Armored Division back to the Right-Brain Tower to help aid Franky in fighting the Beasts Pirates. He and the rest of the Armored Division were eventually taken out by Sasaki's
Heliceratops
.
A recovered Nokokuwa Police was later seen trapped in the Castle Basement by the fire alongside other members of the Alliance.
