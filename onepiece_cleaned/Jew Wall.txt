A
logbook
is a record of events on a voyage.
It is common practice for
ships
to maintain a log and fill it in daily.
Overview
[
]
Logbooks typically contain detailed notes of events on a ship's voyage. They are updated daily and may include specific dates. Logbooks are maintained by various types of sailors, such as
explorers
and
pirates

The keeper of the log may be the captain of a
ship
