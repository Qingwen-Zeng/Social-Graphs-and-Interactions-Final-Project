Sterry
is the
king
of  the
Goa Kingdom
and the husband of the
queen
,
Sarie Nantokanette
.
He was adopted by
Sabo
's family at eight years of age, having originally been born in a separate noble family.
Appearance
[
]
At eight years old, he was somewhat tall for his age, since he was two years younger than Sabo but was still about the same height as him. He wore a shirt with frills going down the middle along with a bow-tie and suspenders. He was often seen smiling. He had a round head with a thin, flat nose and a bowl-shaped haircut.
As an adult, Sterry is much taller, wearing a jacket with a sash on the back over a frilly shirt, frills on his shoulders, and a high collar, as well as a crown on his head. He still has the same hairstyle as he did as a child.
Personality
[
]
Sterry almost faints from being insulted by Garp.
Like most
nobles
in the
Goa Kingdom
, he is an arrogant person who does not care for anyone that is of lesser status than himself, referring to them as trash. This extends to referring to Sabo as "stupid" and "trash" due to what he heard from their parents, all casually, disregarding any manners or respect.
As an adult, Sterry still acts rudely to people of lower status and acts spoiled, as he complained about his lavish living quarters in
Loguetown
.
He even treated the
Marine
hero
Monkey D. Garp
rudely because
Garp
was a citizen of his kingdom, and was aghast when Garp insulted him.
However, Sterry can put up a facade of good manners and devotion in front of his adoptive parents.
Although Sterry's teacher and adoptive parents stated that he was extremely intelligent when he was a child (though by their noble standards), he seems to be extremely ignorant about much of the
world
, with his views on other
races
being mainly based on racist stereotypes and rumors. He considers
fish-men
and
merfolk
to be no more than fish and believes they have a contagious
disease
, and mistook
Neptune
as a
giant
, who he believed ate
humans
and had saliva that could melt rocks.
He has a condescending attitude around the
royalty
of
Fish-Man Island
, silently mocking their decision to explore the forests of
Mary Geoise
, viewing it as an ignorance of human amenities.
He is also not very brave, crying in fear when Sabo threatened him, and shunning any responsibilities when
Sabo
ran away again.
As an adult, he shrunk back in fear upon seeing a
flock of crows
near his
bondola
, worrying they could send him plummeting down the
Red Line
.
He also became panicked when being moved on Mary Geoise's travelator for the first time, thinking it was an earthquake.
He is hungry for power and does not make it a secret, as he explicitly asked Garp about ways to become a
World Noble
.
He even showed a great interest in sitting on the
Empty Throne
and ruling over the entire world, despite the
World Government
's creed that
"no-one"
should sit in it.
Sterry also seems to possess a lewd side, as he quickly fell in love upon seeing a photo of
Nefertari Vivi
, despite his
wife
standing by his side.
Relationships
[
]
Sabo
[
]
In front of their parents, Sterry put up a front and treated
Sabo
respectfully. However, he displayed a mocking attitude towards Sabo in private and confessed that he would have preferred that the "real son" did not return. However, Sterry was easily frightened when Sabo interrogated him.
Despite this, Sterry stills refers to Sabo with an honorific as "brother"
(
兄様
,
ani-sama
?
)
in his adult years and Sabo still mockingly looking down on him, and was rather shocked when he read the
newspaper
that alleges Sabo infiltrated
Mary Geoise
and
assassinated
Nefertari Cobra
.

History

Past
[

Sterry reveals to Sabo the plan to burn Gray Terminal.
When he was 8 years old, Sterry's biological parents were unable to continue raising him and he was adopted by
Outlook III
and
Didit
since he had shown lots of promise. When
Sabo
was brought home by his father after running away to
Gray Terminal
, Sterry introduced himself to him. Later, he went into Sabo's room to insult him as he had heard their parents do and revealed that Sabo was lucky to have been brought home before the
nobles
had Gray Terminal burned down in preparation for a
World Noble
's arrival. Sabo grabbed Sterry and forced him to tell him about this plan, and Sterry watched in shock as Sabo jumped out the window. The next day, Sterry and Sabo met with their teacher before Sabo ran away again.
Sometime before the present, Sterry
married
Princess
Sarie Nantokanette
, and a few months ago became
King
of the
Goa Kingdom
after the suspicious deaths of the king and
prince
.

As the time for
Levely
approached, Sterry and his wife were staying at a hotel for
royalty
in
Loguetown
. He commented to his
queen
that the hotel was nothing special, only offering a view of
Gol D. Roger
's gallows.
Levely Arc
[
]
Upon arriving at the
Red Port
, Sterry went up to
Monkey D. Garp
and tried to give him orders as his
king
, looking for ways to get in with the
World Nobles
, but Garp acted rudely towards him, much to Sterry's shock. He then encountered the
royals
from
Fish-Man Island
, and was overwhelmed by ignorance and fear. He and his
wife
later went up to
Mary Geoise
on the
Bondola
, and he saw a
giant
pop out
of the cliff, but
Ham Burger
believed he was hallucinating. Sterry then grew fearful of
some crows
flying nearby, but Sabo (disguised as a guard) sarcastically tried to assure him that it was safe.
Sterry and the Levely participants with him later reached the top of the
Red Line
. As they made their way to
Pangaea Castle
, Sterry looked down on
Neptune
and
his family
when they declined to use the travelator.
Sterry was later asked to make a pledge before the
Empty Throne
. He was told of the throne's significance and even though he was informed that no one was allowed to sit on it, Sterry desired to do so.
Sterry later went to the conference room with the other kings and
queens
to begin the
Levely
.

Sterry is excited by a picture of Vivi.
After the
Levely
concluded,
CP0
were asking the attendees if they had seen
Nefertari Vivi
, and Sterry gazed lovingly at Vivi's photo, which angered his
wife
.
While sailing back to the
Goa Kingdom
, Sterry received a
newspaper
and expressed shock to find out his adoptive brother
Sabo
had infiltrated
Mary Geoise
during the Levely.
