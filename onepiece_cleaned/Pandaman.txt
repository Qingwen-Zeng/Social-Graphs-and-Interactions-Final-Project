.
Pandaman
is a joke character created by
Eiichiro Oda
, and one of the most prominent
easter eggs
in
One Piece
.
Originally designed for a
Kinnikuman
character creation contest,
Pandaman has gone on to make cameo appearances in many
manga
chapters,
anime
episodes,
films
, and more. He is particularly prominent in several of the video games, even being playable in
the first
Grand Battle!
and
its immediate sequel
.
Due to his status as a joke character, most if not all concrete data on Pandaman has been revealed through the
SBS
, and may or may not be serious on Oda's part.
Appearance
[
]
Pandaman's most distinctive feature is his head, which is stylized to look like his namesake (and sometimes emblazoned with the word
PANDA
). Whether this is a mask or his real face is unknown.
Meanwhile, his physique can vary wildly from appearance to appearance. Though most "official" portraits (including Oda's original contest submission) depict him as tall and well-muscled, many of his cameos in the actual manga and anime depict him as slimmer, if not outright scrawny, to keep him better-hidden in crowd scenes.
Apart from his black trunks and lace-up boots, Pandaman usually goes undressed, and may bear a pair of heart tattoos on his pectorals, and bamboo tattoos on his arms. At times, however, he has been seen in civilian, pirate, or even
Marine
attire.
Pandaman does not always make cameos in the flesh. Indeed, cameos of his name have appeared scattered throughout the series in both
katakana
and
romaji
script.

Personality
[
]
Little has been established about Pandaman's personality in
canon
- save, perhaps, for his cowardice in constantly fleeing from debt collectors.
In contrast, video games frequently portray him with the boisterous, hot-blooded bravado stereotypical to pro-wrestlers. Apart from eagerly accepting any and all challenges to fight, he also constantly peppers his speech with the vocalization
"sasa"
(
ササ
?
)
, a reference to the term for bamboo
(
笹
,
sasa
?
)
.
Relationships
[
]
Pandawomanmi
[
]
Pandawomanmi
Pandaman is said to be in love with
Pandawomanmi
, but it is unknown if these feelings are reciprocated.
Tomato Gang
[
]
Pandaman, unfortunately, is also constantly on the run from
Tomato Gang
, a debt collector to whom Pandaman owes money.
Unforgivable Mask
[
]
Pandaman's greatest rival,
Unforgivable Mask
, is hired by Tomato Gang to track Pandaman down and retrieve the money he owes Tomato Gang.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
While Pandaman has demonstrated no combat ability in any of his appearances, he does - according to Oda's contest write-up - have a small repertoire of attacks:
S.P.D.
, short for
Sasa no Ha Panda Drop
(
笹の葉パンダドロップ
,
Sasa no Ha Panda Doroppu
?
, literally meaning "Bamboo Leaves Panda Drop")
.
Giant Panda Deathlock
(
ジャイアントパンダデスロック
,
Jaianto Panda Desurokku
?
)
.
The same write-up also notes that Pandaman has a strength of 3,300,000
Chojin Power
after eating bamboo and before meals.
In his playable appearances in
Grand Battle!
and
Grand Battle! 2
, Pandaman uses a variety of wrestling-based attacks, with the Giant Panda Deathlock in particular portrayed as a brutal
backbreaker
drop; aside from these, he also possesses the ability to summon
Panda Sharks
against enemies. Meanwhile,
Gigant Battle!
portrays him with the ability to fire an energy beam by crossing his forearms.
History
[
]
As an infant, Pandaman was said to have been abandoned in a bamboo thicket, and subsequently raised by giant pandas. Growing up, he was frequently picked on for claiming to have seen
Princess Kaguya
, and as a result trained to become a "Devil Chojin"
(
悪魔超人
,
Akuma chōjin
?
)
.
Eventually, Pandaman grew into a man of wealth and prestige, supposedly presiding over his own island.
Rumors of this island (and its panda-like populace) reached as far as
Foosha Village
.
Some time later, however, Pandaman fell into financial trouble with the debt collector
Tomato Gang
, who began relentlessly pursuing him, even hiring his rival
Unforgivable Mask
as an enforcer.
Pandaman first crossed paths with the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Baratie Arc
, where he witnessed the altercation between
Sanji
and
Fullbody
.
Since then, he has appeared in the background of every locale the Straw Hats have visited (and several they have not, such as
Lulusia Kingdom
).
The one exception is the all-female isle of
Amazon Lily
, where
Pandawomanmi
is seen instead; it is said that Pandaman fell in love with this woman, but it is unclear whether she even knows he exists.
(The true age of Pandaman remains unknown, though his
chronologically
earliest appearance places him among
Mont Blanc Noland
's voyages, some four hundred years before the Great Age of Pirates.

Anime and Manga Influences
[
]
Pandaman was originally conceived for the
New Chojin Contest
(
新超人コンテスト
,
Shin chōjin kontesuto
?
)
, a character-design contest for the pro-wrestling series
Kinnikuman
.
As such, his design is meant to evoke a costumed pro wrestler, with lots of exposed skin, striking colors, and an overall "foreign" theme akin to those used by
heel wrestlers
in real life.
(Oda would return to pro-wrestling for several later character designs, including
Jesus Burgess
,
Spandam
, and the
Jeet
-
Abdullah
duo.)
In addition, Pandaman's (supposed) backstory directly references the myth of
Princess Kaguya
, who was said to have been discovered in a bamboo stalk by a kindly woodcutter.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The
anime
portrays Pandaman more-or-less identically to the manga—as a background curiosity who interacts with neither the plot nor the other characters in any meaningful way. However, the anime will often insert Pandaman cameos where the manga had none; indeed, the anime Pandaman made his first appearance during the
Syrup Village Arc
, mixed in among the
Black Cat Pirates
.
Special Episode
[
]
Pandaman's usual status was completely subverted in one installment of the
Boss Luffy Historical Special
, where he not only interacted with other characters, but played a pivotal role in the plot.
"Tou-san", a not-so-hidden Pandaman, interacting with the main characters.
In the alternate
Jidaigeki
-esque
reality known as the
Grand Jipang
(
グランドジパング
,
Gurando Jipangu
?
)
, Pandaman is a well-beloved townsman known as "Pop"
(
父さん
,
Tō-san
?
)
. This moniker led to much trouble when he fell ill, shortly after being trapped in debt to the gang-leader
Buggy
. On finding him in the care of
a neighborhood girl
, the Buggy Gang assumed she was his daughter and schemed to sell her off as collateral, even enlisting aid from
a corrupt magistrate
. Nevertheless, this scheme was foiled by
Boss Luffy
and the aristocrat
Vivi
.
After Buggy's threat was ended, his would-be debtor joined Boss Luffy and several close friends in celebrating the exotic foreign holiday known as
Christmas
.
