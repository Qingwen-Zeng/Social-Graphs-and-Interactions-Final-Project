History

Making their Mark
[
]
Banshee joined the
Spade Pirates
and traveled with
Ace
as he made a name for himself. She helped fight off a group of
bounty hunters
, and, when
Isuka
infiltrated the
crew's ship
, she surrounded the
Marine Ensign
alongside her crewmates. However, she easily fended them off. After the confrontation, the crew reached
Sabaody Archipelago
. While they waited for their ship to be
coated
, Banshee and her crewmates explored the island and secretly read
Masked Deuce
's adventure diary. They laughed at his poor writing skills, leading Deuce to exclude their names from the diary.
At one point, the Spade Pirates were shipwrecked in
Wano Country
. The people from
Amigasa Village
were starving to death, so they tied up the entire crew and stole all their food. The crew watched the villagers finish their meal and then broke out. Instead of attacking, Ace asked the villagers where he could get them dessert.
They stayed in Amigasa Village for a few weeks and became good friends with
Tama
.
They also went to
Onigashima
to liberate the abducted children from the
Beasts Pirates
. They never encountered
Kaidou
and his top subordinates because they were away on an expedition. After Ace did so much damage to
Kaidou's castle
, the Spade Pirates met
Yamato
. After a scuffle, Ace and Yamato became acquainted.
Encountering Whitebeard
[
]
The Spade Pirates prepare to fight Whitebeard.
After Ace and
Jinbe
tied, Banshee and the other Spade Pirates defended their
captain
against
Edward Newgate
and were easily defeated. They were then taken into the
Whitebeard Pirates
like their captain.
