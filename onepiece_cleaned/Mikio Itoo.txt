Mikio Itoo
is a background joke character created by
Eiichiro Oda
, and arguably the first
Easter Egg
featured in
One Piece
.
He is a caricature of
Mikio Ito
(
いとうみきお
,
Itō Mikio
?
)
, a
Yokohama
-born manga creator whom Oda knew as a fellow assistant to
Nobuhiro Watsuki
. Like Oda, Ito went on to publish his own series in
Weekly Shonen Jump
, such as
Normandy Secret Club
and
Mysterious Murasame-kun
.
Within the
world
of
One Piece
, Itoo appears to be a wanted gunman with a bounty of one million
yen
. How many
belly
this would amount to is unknown.
Appearance
[

Mikio Itoo's wanted poster in the digitally colored manga.
Thus far, Itoo has "appeared" mostly on
wanted posters
scattered throughout areas of the
East Blue
. These tend to vary greatly in detail; the most detailed depicts him as a man with an untidy mop of brown hair and matching beard.
Like
Pandaman
, Itoo's name has independently appeared on a number of other items, most notably alcohol bottles.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Due to its tendency to gloss over small background details from the manga (especially in its early episodes), the
anime
has kept few, if any, of Itoo's appearances. Among its many
Chapter 1
adaptations, only the
Episode of East Blue
special maintained the angle and composition of the scene "introducing" his wanted poster in the back of
Partys Bar
; even this adaptation, however, redrew the poster to feature someone else.

Chapter 1
of the manga.
