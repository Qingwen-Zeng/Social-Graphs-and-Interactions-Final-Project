Appearance
Snack is a very wide man with a long nose, dark black hair tied in a bun that's been dyed red with a hairpin that has three jewels through it, and a dark blue tattoo above his right eye. He wears a yellow woolen jacket resembling sheep's wool and the sleeves are bright orange with his name "SNACK" printed on it, a dark black scarf with thin orange stripes on it, and has armor plates with two belts on each side on his arms, dark black pants with thin orange stripes while has two suspenders hanging each side of his waist, and dark brown shoes with red socks. His head is rather small in comparison to his body.
Personality
Little is known about Snack's personality, but he is loyal to his family and crew even after he was demoted from his Sweet Commander position, as he came to
Cacao Island
to help fight against the
Straw Hat Pirates
. He has a strong hatred for the Worst Generation due to his loss against Urouge costing him his position as a Sweet Commander.
Relationships
Big Mom Pirates
Snack was one of the Sweet Commanders and a high-ranking member of the Big Mom Pirates, and
Charlotte Cracker
and
Big Mom
retaliated with rage after Snack's defeat by Urouge, respectively sending a large fleet and storm after him.
He was nevertheless demoted for his defeat.
Abilities and Powers
As the Minister of Fries, Snack has authority over
Potato Island
,
and as an officer of the
Big Mom Pirates
, he has authority over lower-ranking members of his crew.
As he is formerly one of the Sweet Commanders, Snack had great authority and power over the crew, second only to
Big Mom
herself. However, he was defeated in combat by
Urouge
of the
Worst Generation
.
Consequently, he was demoted from his position as a Sweet Commander and lost the authority that came with the title.
His combat power is reflected by his large bounty of
600,000,000.
Given that he held the title of Sweet Commander, he is likely stronger than his very powerful siblings,
Compote
,
Daifuku
,
Oven
, and even
Perospero
, whose bounty is
100,000,000 higher than his own.

After Luffy exited the Mirro-Word, Snack was surprised when

attacked the Big Mom Pirates' fleet around the island.
He was then so preoccupied with fighting
