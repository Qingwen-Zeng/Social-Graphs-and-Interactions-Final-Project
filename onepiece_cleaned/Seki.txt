Seki
is the deposed
king
of
Lulusia Kingdom
and one of fifty monarchs who took part in the
Levely
.
He is the father of
Princess
Komane
.
Appearance
[
]
Seki is a man with a pronounced jawline with fangs for his upper canine teeth, pointed ears, and long dark-blond hair that is combed back. He wears a long dark coat over a purple suit with a white cravat and pink rose boutonniere, dark trousers and white gloves.
In his first appearance in the anime, his design was slightly different from the manga, and he wore a purple shirt with a thick white collar, alongside a dark purple cape and white gloves.
Personality
[
]
Seki is known to be a cruel ruler whose regime contributed to the suffering of his people.
Even though the commoners could barely make ends meet, he still forced them to provide him and the
World Nobles
with tributes.
On the other hand, he, at the very least, seemed to care about his
country
, as he is grateful to
Akainu
for defeating the
pirates
that attacked it four years ago.
In addition, he seems to care greatly about his family, as evidenced by his daughter's claim that her father would pay any amount of ransom to get her back safely.
Furthermore, Seki appears to be somewhat pompous, as he seemed to be skeptical that a region unaffiliated with the
World Government
, such as the
Wano Country
, could even be considered a nation.
Even when overthrown and incarcerated, Seki remained defiant, angrily threatening his captors with death should the
Marines
rescue him and his daughter. However, he looked in horror as beams of light rained down to obliterate his kingdom.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Seki was the
king
of a nation affiliated with the
World Government
and one of the few allowed to attend the
Levely
, which granted him some authority over matters concerning the
world
.
He lost these powers after being deposed by his subjects.

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
Seki and Komane are deposed by their citizens.
When the
Levely
concluded, Seki and
Komane
returned home to the
Lulusia Kingdom
. However, their citizens, having been inspired by the recent actions of the
Revolutionary Army
, revolted against them. The
revolution
ended up being successful, and Seki and Komane were imprisoned. However, the kingdom and the entire island it was on were then annihilated by
Imu
, with Seki last being seen witnessing a strong light descending from the sky upon his country.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, Seki and
Lemoncheese
are only seen having a short conversation about
Wano
. However, the anime expands this conversation and also discusses a little about
Seki's kingdom
, establishing through his conversation with Lemoncheese that he has held the throne of his kingdom for at least four years. Additionally, other monarchs, such as
Potaufeu
and
Samosa
, also joined in on their conversation.
