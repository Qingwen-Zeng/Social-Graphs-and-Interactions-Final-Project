After the guards at the torii gates were defeated by the Straw Hats, the Heart Pirates and the
Scabbards
(except Kin'emon and
Denjiro
) traversed to the back of
Onigashima
in the Polar Tang.
When the submarine got close enough, it rose to the surface and Law
teleported
himself, Bepo, Shachi, Penguin, and the Scabbards with them to Onigashima's back entrance. Once they left, the rest of the crew submerged back underwater.
After Kaidou knocked Luffy off of the floating island, the crew aboard the Polar Tang could hear Luffy's voice and located him underwater.
They brought him onto the submarine and pumped the water out of his stomach.
Luffy eventually woke up and started demanding for meat.
They eventually docked at Tokage Port for Luffy to regain his strength.
After Luffy finished eating,
Kouzuki Momonosuke
transformed into an adult dragon, which panicked the Heart Pirates who thought it was Kaidou.
The Heart Pirates watched in stunned silence as Luffy and Momonosuke bickered over the dragon's struggle to fly. Eventually Momonosuke remembered how and flew up to the island.
The Heart Pirates also made it up the island and were startled as
Yamato
in
his wolf form
rushed past them.
They entered the
Skull Dome
and found their way to where Law and Kid were fighting
Big Mom

Hera
strike them with lightning.
