History
[

Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
caused chaos in
Rasetsu Town
following
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution and escaped, Himuro and the
Mimawarigumi
began patrolling the
Flower Capital
to provide extra security.
A week later, the Mimawarigumi accompanied
Orochi
to
Onigashima
to party with
Kaidou
and the
Beasts Pirates
at the Golden Kagura during the
Fire Festival
. Upon setting sail, Orochi decided to start drinking and Himuro advised him to wait until they got to
Kaidou's dwelling
, but Orochi ignored his advice and replied that Kaidou was probably drinking already.
During the festivities on Onigashima, Kaidou came out to the
Live Stage
to announce his "
New Onigashima Project
". When Orochi protested this project, Kaidou beheaded him. He then gave the Mimawarigumi and
Orochi Oniwabanshu
the ultimatum to join his pirate crew or die, and Himuro listened while visibly shaken.
In response, the group's leader
Hotei
swore their allegiance to Kaidou. Himuro made a pitying comment about Orochi, but quickly accepted his new role as a member of the Beasts Pirates.
Hyougoro defeats Himuro.
After
Queen
unleashed the
Ice Oni
virus
and gave
Scratchmen Apoo
the antidote, Hotei ordered his allies to retrieve it.
After
Hyougoro
had been infected by the Ice Oni virus and physically returned to his prime self, Himuro and the Mimawarigumi challenged him, but they were
struck down
by the former
yakuza
boss.
