Not much is known about Dosmarche's personality, but since he took part in
Big Mom
's plan to
assassinate
the
Vinsmoke Family
and helped his crew chase after and attack the
Germa Kingdom
, he can be considered very loyal to his family and crew.
He was frightened by the thought of Big Mom's reaction to the destruction of

Abilities and Powers

As the Minister of Tea, Dosmarche has authority over
Black Island
