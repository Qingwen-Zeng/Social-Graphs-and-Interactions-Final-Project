Personality
[
]
Having only appeared on a small number of occasions, there is little of her personality that can be ascertained as of late, aside from a confident stance and a somewhat laid-back demeanor. She also seems very loyal to Whitebeard, as she answered his call to arms to save Ace. She took pride in the talent of her ship stating that it can go where it is needed.
During her years with the Whitebeard pirates, she was reluctant to volunteer Marco due to him being a beginner.

Pirate Ship

Whitey Bay's icebreaker shattering Aokiji's ice.
Whitey Bay's
pirate ship
is an
icebreaker
(
砕氷船
,
saihyōsen
?
)
.
Whitey's icebreaker has a steel-plated hull instead of a wooden hull seen on most other ships in the series so far. Also in place of a figurehead, the ship has a snowflake insignia on the front. On board the ship is the cabin which also has snowflakes painted on the walls, and has cannons mounted on top. There are masts and sails, with the front sail having the crew's
Jolly Roger
painted on it.
Because of the ship's steel-plated hull, it boasts higher offensive and defensive capabilities. Its main purpose is to break through ice-covered waters, including the
sea of ice
created by
Admiral
Aokiji
. This made her ship the only one of the entire
Whitebeard Pirates
capable of continuing onward, while the rest were trapped by the ice. Additionally, her ship broke through a section of Marineford's wall.

Early Years

Whitey Bay 30 Years Ago
Thirty years ago, Whitey Bay was still an immediate member of the
Whitebeard Pirates
when they arrived for the first time at
Wano Country
. The crew was shipwrecked and had decided to go into the island to gather supplies. When
Marco
offered to go along, Whitey Bay disproved of it on the basis that he was just an apprentice. A few moments later, they encountered
Kouzuki Oden
, who, after a brief clash, asked
Whitebeard
to let him join their crew.
The Whitebeard Pirates later had a feast with Oden and his retainers. Oden kept asking to join the crew, but he was turned down. Two weeks later, the Whitebeard Pirates tried to leave Wano without Oden. As they were leaving, the crew was surprised when Oden wrapped a chain around the
Moby Dick
's mast and got dragged with the ship. As Oden held onto the chain,
Izou
was also holding on to Oden and got dragged with him. After Izou was pulled up onboard, Oden accepted Whitebeard's challenge of holding onto the chain for three days before he could be accepted into the crew. For the next three days, the crew watched how Oden withstood his ordeal. When Oden had an hour left to complete the challenge, the crew started cheering for him. After Oden was accepted into the crew, the Whitebeard Pirates had adventures with him as well as
Toki
, whom Oden helped, and
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
, who had stowed away on the Moby Dick.
Four years after Oden joined, the Whitebeard Pirates arrived at an island and noticed a commotion that frightened even the animals. The crew then clashed with the
Roger Pirates
for three days and three nights before the skirmish ultimately became a gift exchange. Afterwards, the Whitebeard Pirates parted ways with Oden and his family.
Rise to Infamy
[
]
Whitey Bay later established her own crew and became an infamous pirate herself, while remaining subordinate to Whitebeard.

Marineford Arc
[
]
Whitey Bay at Marineford.
Upon learning that
Portgas D. Ace
was going to be executed, Whitey Bay and her crew joined forces with several other pirates and Whitebeard's crew to rescue Ace. Arriving at
Marineford
, as the war with the
Marines
began, the pirates found their ships frozen at sea by
Aokiji
.
However, this setback did not stop Whitey Bay and her crew. Due to their ship being an icebreaker, they simply broke through the ice. As they sailed, they created another opening in the Marine's formations for which Whitebeard and his subordinates could progress through besides the opening created by
Little Oars Jr.
earlier.
As the battle raged on and events unfolded, Whitey Bay and the other pirates were instructed to stop attacking Marineford straightforwardly.
Whitebeard
noticed something was going on with the Marines and thus instructed Bay and the rest to instead attack the base from the sides.
Upon the arrival of
Shanks
and
Sengoku
calling the war to a close, Bay along with the rest of Whitebeard's crew left.
The following events are

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga version of Whitebeard and Ace's funeral in
Chapter 590
, Whitey Bay cannot be seen among those in attendance. However, the anime version of the exact same scene in
Episode 505
explicitly shows Whitey Bay alongside the other attendees.
Although it can be assumed that Whitey Bay was at the funeral, there is no visual evidence of her attendance in the manga to support this assumption and, as such, her attendance can only be considered non-canon.
In the anime, she is among the news reports of those defeated by
Edward Weevil
, alongside the reports of
Elmy
,
Ramba
,
Bizarre
,
A O
, the
Decalvan Brothers
, and
Palms
.
