Vice Admiral Strawberry
is a
Marine
officer, and one of the five
vice admirals
who led the
Buster Call
assault on
Enies Lobby
.
Appearance
[
]
Strawberry is a relatively straight shaped person with a long beard. He is usually seen with his eyes closed, or at least half-closed. He wears a very long bearskin version of the standard Marine uniform cap due to his head being abnormally long.
Like many high-ranking Marines, he has a standard Marine's coat draped on his shoulders like a cape. Under it, and over a shirt left unbuttoned near the neck, he wears a water-green jacket, with pale yellow rope-like ornaments on the chest, and matching pants.
Ten years ago, his beard was very thin and his eyes were half-closed. He wore a greenish suit with a darker shirt accompanied by a pale yellow tie with black spots and wore a normal Navy cap, despite his head. Like the other top brass in the Navy, he wore an official Navy cape as part of his uniform.
Personality
[
]
Strawberry is somewhat scrupulous, doing what is morally right by saving everyone trapped on Enies Lobby before attacking. Therefore, he presumably follows moral justice, or at least a more lenient version of
Absolute Justice
, like most Marines. Nonetheless, he saw the slaves of the
World Nobles
as their property with his duty to bring them back, and did not show any sympathy that said slave was a
young girl
.
He is also usually seen with a calm expression.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a Marine vice admiral, Strawberry is capable of commanding a Buster Call alongside other vice admirals. He also has authority over lower-ranking subordinates.
Due to the large size of his head, he has very strong headbutts.
Weapons
[
]
Strawberry was shown holding two identical swords with Japanese-looking hilts wrapped in a pink material. They have elongated hand-guards decorated by red gems, just like the rounded pommels, and blades with more of a curve than those of katanas. He wields both of them in reverse, similar to
Doma
.
Haki
[
]
Further information:
Haki
It was stated that all vice admirals possess Haki,
so Strawberry can also use the ability.
History

Past
[
]
While the
Sun Pirates
were wreaking havoc in the seas,
Rear Admiral
Strawberry reported to
Vice Admiral
Borsalino
that Rear Admiral
Kadar
's ship had been sunk.
Later, after the
Marines
received a tip regarding the arrival of the Sun Pirates to return
Koala
, a freed
slave
of the
World Nobles
, Strawberry led an army of soldiers to ambush
Fisher Tiger
on
Foolshout Island
.
Jinbe
and some of the other Sun Pirates interrupted the execution, freeing their captain, although he was grievously wounded and ultimately died.
Sometime after Jinbe became the new captain of the Sun Pirates, Strawberry—now covered in head bandages after his battle with Jinbe—went to
Marineford
and informed his superiors about Jinbe and his strength.

Strawberry at Enies Lobby.
Strawberry, along with his colleagues
Onigumo
,
Doberman
,
Yamakaji
, and
Momonga
, was summoned by Vice Admiral
John Giant
to execute the
Buster Call
on
Enies Lobby
, which had been wrongly invoked by
Spandam
.
Strawberry's ships arrived near the entrance of the island, where many Marines and
World Government
agents had gathered. As the
Franky Family
and others rushed to escape on the ships as well, Strawberry had them held at gunpoint until the Marines and agents could be verified and boarded. Once complete, the ships pulled away from the island, and the Buster Call began.
After ceasing the bombardment, the ships gathered at the Bridge of Hesitation. Strawberry was surprised to learn that
Oimo
,
Kashii
, the
Galley-La Company
shipwrights, and the Franky Family had survived the bombardment by clinging on the side of the island using a net made by
Paulie
. However, the Marines remained focused on the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Their attempts to recapture
Nico Robin
and kill
Monkey D. Luffy
were in vain, leaving Enies Lobby in ruin.

Marineford Arc
[

Strawberry later heeded the call for troops at Marineford and stood along with the other vice admirals against the incoming attack by
Whitebeard
's division commanders. When the pirates in the bay lost their ships, Strawberry ordered the troops to open fire on them, claiming them to be perfect targets.
Later, when
Luffy
attempted to free
Ace
from his handcuffs, Strawberry gave another order to open fire on the two pirates.
When the
Blackbeard Pirates
arrived, he is shocked to see
Marshall D. Teach
's new crewmates, the strongest prisoners from Level 6 of
Impel Down
. He recognizes
Sanjuan Wolf
because of his immense size.
