A full body view of Damask in the anime.
Damask sports a gas mask, with an aviator-style hat. He has thin eyes with predominant lower eye lids, and also has wild and crazy light colored hair.
Personality
[
]
Damask seems to be very forceful, trying to attack Hakuba during the pirate's frenzy.
Since he is called a pyromaniac,
he could potentially suffer from
Pyromania
, a compulsive disorder characterized by obsession with fire or uncontrollable urges to start fires, which would also explain his desire to obtain the
Mera Mera no Mi
.
He has been shown to be honorable, as seen when he confronted Doflamingo with the other gladiators to buy Luffy time.

Not much is known about his skills in combat, but he must be confident in his strength as he entered as a contestant at the

Damask's flamethrower.
Damask's mask has a flamethrower built into the mouth section, capable of spitting intense streams of flames

During the final phase of
Doflamingo

Birdcage

Although the manga shows his flamethrower emitting smoke even when he does not use it, the anime does not show smoke, even when using it.
