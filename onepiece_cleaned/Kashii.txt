together with
Oimo

giants
who guarded the front gate of
Enies Lobby
for over fifty years until he and Oimo realized they were tricked by the
World Government
.
He is a member of the
Giant Warrior Pirates
. He and Oimo became major allies to the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Enies Lobby Arc
and
Egghead Arc

Appearance
[
]
Kashii is a giant who wears viking attire, has long dark hair and a big semi-bearded chin. He sports orange suspenders, which hold up an orange and black kilt with yellow buttons on it; otherwise, his torso and arms are bare, exposing well-toned muscles. He has big black boots that go up his shins, as well as an orange helmet with a tan brim and two small tan striped around the middle. The top of the helmet has light blue frills reminiscent of a mohawk, supported by a tan protrusion along the center, and two small horns are on the sides. He is usually seen with his axe.
Personality
[
]
Kashii proved to be very fond of his captains, to the point of being willing to work at Enies Lobby for a hundred years, in order to obtain their release from Impel Down. When he discovered the World Government's deception, he became angry and rebelled.
Relationships
[
]
Friends
[
]
Oimo
[
]
Oimo is a fellow giant comrade who Kashii appears to always be together with. They've been together over a 100 years since their time as members of the Giant Warrior Pirates and guarding the entrance of Enies Lobby. They both share a strong loyalty to their former pirate crew and they both expressed extreme anger over how the World Government tricked them.
Brogy and Dorry
[
]
Kashii deeply respects his two former captains, Brogy and Dorry. He displayed concern over his captains ever since they started their duel under Ebalf Tradition, and after 50 years he went out with Oimo to seek them. This loyalty was used against him by the World Government where they tricked him and Oimo into believing Brogy and Dorry were captured and enter an agreement that they would protect Enies Lobby for a 100 years in exchange for their captains' safe return. When Usopp informed Oimo of the World Government's deception, Kashii has shown relief over how his two captains were actually still safe fighting their duel.
Sogeking
[
]
Along with Oimo, Kashii has shown both respect and gratitude towards Usopp after learning the truth about his two captain from him. He personally assisted the sniper in his quest to save Nico Robin by letting Usopp ride his shoulder and have him catch up with the rest of the Straw Hats in front of the Tower of Justice in Enies Lobby. While assisting in the repairs of
Water 7
, he invited Usopp to join him and Oimo to return to Elbaph. Despite Usopp declining the offer, he wasn't bothered by the decision and believe that they will reunite until the day the Straw Hats visit Ebalf.
Enemies
[
]
World Government
[
]
As a member of the Giant Warrior Pirates, Kashii is an enemy to both the World Government and the Navy. However, when the Navy captured him and Oimo, the World Government tricked them into believing they were holding their captains, Dorry and Brogy, prisoner, and that they would be released after he and Oimo guard the entrance of Enies Lobby for a 100 years. While Kashii appeared to be rather casual to the Navy during his time as a Gatekeeper, this immediately changed to deep resentment after learning of their deception from Usopp.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a giant, Kashii possesses superhuman strength and resistance. As a demonstration of his strength, he together with Oimo were able to successfully protect the doors of Enies Lobby for fifty years. Together with Oimo, he also managed to defeat the
Kairiki Destroyers
, the three strongest members of the Franky Family after Franky himself, in an instant.
Even after receiving numerous injuries from the joint efforts of the
Galley-La
foremen,
Franky Family
,
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
, Kashii still had enough strength to sow panic at Enies Lobby together with Oimo, defeating numerous marines.
He also survived after taking full cannon shots from a marine battleship.
Weapons
[
]
He wields a large broad axe though how skilled he is with it is not known.

Life as a Pirate
[
]
A century before the beginning of the series, Kashii was a member of the
Giant Warrior Pirates
. He was present when
Yuki
asked
Dorry
and
Brogy
which one of their catches were bigger. After they challenged one another to a duel, Kashii left
Little Garden
with the rest of the pirates.
Around 40 years after Dorry and Brogy started their duel, Kashii was seen at Elbaph on the day before the
Winter Solstice
Festival. During a conversation with other giants, Kashii wondered how the duel between Dorry and Brogy could take so long. He then asked Charlotte Linlin if she and her friends were ready for the event. When
Jarul
and
Jorul
appeared there, Kashii asked them where they were going.
The World Government's Lie
[
]
Oimo and Kashii twenty-two years before the start of the series.
About fifty years ago, thinking it strange that neither one of their bosses had returned yet, Kashii, along with Oimo, left Elbaph to return to Little Garden and find out what had become of their bosses. Along the way, they were captured by Marines, and were interrogated about their crew and purpose. They were then told that Dorry and Brogy had been captured and were imprisoned in the
government's great prison
. The World Government made a deal with them that if they worked for them for 100 years, they would set their bosses free and allow all four of them to return home together. Oimo and Kashii agreed, and became the guardians of Enies Lobby's front gates. For fifty years, they guarded the gates successfully.
Twenty-two years before the start of the series, Oimo and Kashii heard the news that the Pirate King Gol D. Roger had been executed. Kashii believed that there would be more pirates in the future, but Oimo was confident that they would not attack Enies Lobby.
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
After fifty years of service, they fight against the
Franky Family
,
Straw Hat Pirates
, and
Galley-La Company
foremen as soon as the three groups invaded the island. Due to it being nighttime, the giants are asleep when
Luffy
makes it through, but are awakened by a Marine shortly afterwards, at
Spandam
's command.
They emerge to fight the majority of the Franky Family once they reach the Main Gate, and have no difficulty in deterring their efforts, bringing most of them down quickly. The tide soon turns against them, however, when the foremen,
Zambai
,
Kiwi
, and
Mozu
come to the gate riding
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
.
Kiwi and Mozu use their Hull Dismantler Slash to destroy Kashii's shoes, knocking him off-balance, and Paulie uses
Timber Hitch Tug
while Zambai blasts him in the face with a bazooka, knocking him down and against the gatehouse.
Tilestone
and
Lulu
use Tree Nail Lock to immobilize Kashii, and Zambai, standing on the giant's face, tricks Oimo into smashing his partner's face with his club, knocking him out.
Kashii is unconscious while Oimo tells Usopp (still disguised as Sogeking) their story, and Usopp reveals that Dorry and Brogy were still fighting, and that the World Government had lied to them.
Oimo and Kashii help the Franky Family and Galley-La foremen escape.
Angered at being deceived for fifty years, Oimo and Kashii switched sides and swore vengeance upon the World Government that had kept them in the dark for so long.
This was first revealed to the
Houbantai
, who had just managed to overwhelm the three Galley-La foremen, when they approached from the front gate and began attacking them.
The two giants rampaged through the island, bringing the foremen with them, and arrived at the courthouse just in time to save the Franky Family from being overwhelmed by the Marines when
Yokozuna
was knocked out by one of the
Just Eleven Jurymen
. They took his place in guarding the door to the inner courthouse,
keeping the Marines out, but not before flinging Sogeking up to the rooftop to rejoin the Straw Hats.
While Oimo and Kashii proved very effective in guarding the courthouse, they eventually reached their limit, and were brought down when the Marines and Agents swarmed them. They were tied up along with the invaders in the courthouse (grinning constantly while they are bound, for some reason), but before any further actions could be taken against them, Spandam broadcasted to the entire island that he had accidentally triggered the
Buster Call
. All of the Marines and Agents flee to escape Enies Lobby, leaving the invaders and giants tied up at the courthouse.
Soon afterwards, they are freed thanks to Paulie, who had tied himself up with his own ropes. Oimo and Kashii carry Sodom and Gomorrah while the Franky Family and Galley-La Foremen ride on the King Bulls. The giants encounter no difficulty as they head towards the front of the island, where the Puffing Tom waits. Upon reaching the sea train, however, they find themselves facing three Marine battleships, onto which the Marines and Agents stationed in Enies Lobby are boarding. The cannons and rifles on board aimed at them, they can do nothing but hold their ground until the battleships finally fire, hitting them with enough force to blow away the front gate and seemingly killing them.
However, shortly after Luffy defeats Rob Lucci of the CP9, it is revealed that thanks to Paulie's ropes, they all managed to escape death by hanging on the side of the island. With nobody guarding the front gate anymore, they clamber back to the island and board the Puffing Tom. Upon hearing that the Straw Hats have escaped, they set out from Enies Lobby themselves, for a smooth voyage back to Water 7.
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Oimo and Kashii are next seen helping to repair Water 7 from the effects of Aqua Laguna, Usopp alongside them. The two decide that they cannot go to Little Garden if their bosses are still fighting, so they decide to stay on Water 7 for a while to help rebuild it, and then go back to
Elbaph
. They invite Usopp to join them, and he considers the offer, but ultimately declines in order to rejoin the Straw Hat Pirates. The giants also attend the Straw Hats' barbecue party after Luffy awakens, and after the Straw Hats' departure from Water 7, they express their anticipation of the crew visiting Elbaph someday.

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
After returning to Elbaph, Oimo and Kashii were reunited with Dorry and Brogy. The giants were in the bar with
Shanks
and the
Red Hair Pirates
when the
Kid Pirates
began attacking the
Emperor
's subordinate crews near Elbaph.
Oimo and Kashii watched as their captains sank the
Victoria Punk
.
Oimo and Kashii save Sanji from Nusjuro.
Afterwards, the Giant Warrior Pirates sailed to
Egghead
in order to pick up the Straw Hats. They reached the island after the Buster Call had begun, so they attacked the Marines' ships.
The giants made landfall and spread out across the island, continuing to destroy the ships.
Later on, Oimo and Kashii would take notice of
Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro
's attempted attack on
Jewelry Bonney
and her allies. After Nusjuro injured Sanji, the two giants jumped to his defense, holding the Elder back from injuring him further as Bonney
turned into giant
and attacked Nusjuro.
Nusjuro managed to free himself and attacked Bonney, Oimo, and Kashii. Nusjuro then created a shockwave which knocked out Kashii.
