Saint Figarland Garling
is a
World Noble
of the
Figarland Family
and one of the
Five Elders
who publicly head the
World Government
, holding the title
Warrior God of Science and Defense
.
Previously, Garling served as Supreme Commander of the
God's Knights
, as part of whom he became a "champion" of
God Valley
38 years ago.
After decades of being a God's Knight, Garling was named an Elder to succeed
Jaygarcia Saturn
, who was killed by
Imu
following his failure during the
Egghead Incident
.
Due to his role, and along with the other Elders, Garling is one of the main antagonists of the
Final Saga
.
Appearance
[
]
Garling is a tall, well-built man of advanced age, with a visibly wrinkled face and a sharp, aquiline nose. His pale-blond hair is long and very distinctively styled into a pair of unbent, side-facing spikes left and right on his head, alongside one extremely tall, forward-bent spike on top. Garling's facial hair consists of a mustache with a large beard linked to his sideburns (also forming spikes), which culminates in a large forward spike below his chin and makes it so that his hair-and-beard combo resembles a front-facing crescent moon;
when seen from the front, his facial hair more so resembles a four-pointed star.
In the anime, he appears to have a lack of facial hair below his mustache that separates it from his beard.
As a God's Knight, Garling wore what resembled a variant of the typical World Noble suit, red in color with a thick, standing collar, which was mostly hidden underneath an ankle-length, hooded black coat adorned with golden knobs (bearing the World Government's five-circle insignia) on the upper arms; unlike other Celestial Dragons, however, he did not wear gloves with his outfit. Garling's footwear consisted of black dress boots, and his eyes were covered by red circle-frame sunglasses.
Upon being appointed as one of the Five Elders, Garling changed his wardrobe into a full dark-colored suit paired with a simple light-colored dress shirt and tie, plus a light-colored, collared cape draped over his shoulders. He also took off his shades upon greeting his fellow Elders in the Room of Authority, but continued to carry his saber in his left hand.
Thirty-eight years ago, a much younger Garling had a similar appearance to now, his head hair already matching its present-day size and shape (with two strands loose on either side of his face), though his facial hair was still absent beyond minor chin stubble. Garling was apparently considered quite attractive given that he had female fans swooning over him. For attire, he notably eschewed wearing a
bubble
around his head like his Noble compatriots. Similar to his current cloak, Garling wore a dark cape with light fur trim particularly thick around the collar, and below a three-button shirt of dark color: high-collared, adorned on the left by two disc brooches with the government symbol, and cut off above his abdomen like a half-shirt, transitioning into a light-colored lower half that went past his waistline, was thickly and vertically striated next to each front hem, and held closed by a light-colored belt with two buckles (the government symbol on each). In addition, Garling donned dark gloves and plate-armor components, namely two light-colored vambraces and pauldrons (the latter made of a circular cop and one lame each). Garling's lower wear consisted of dark pants with light greaves and dark, ankle-high boots.
Personality
[
]
Garling is an equanimous and confident man. While seeming not as self-indulgent, cowardly, or ignorant of the
world
as lesser World Nobles, he is still no less arrogant and depraved, as he sees anyone beneath his own station as "trash". He is ruthless in his administration of punishment to those who break World Noble rules and customs, believing in particular that those nobles who protect people of lower status debase themselves into being even lower than trash; Garling was willing to execute Saint
Mjosgard
for that very crime (namely defending the
Neptune Royal Family
and/or the
pirates
who, in turn, protected them).
Indeed, much like other Celestial Dragons, Garling is exceedingly cruel without the slightest regard for the lives of commoners, deeming them so worthless that the slaughter of an entire island's native population (and partaking therein) means little more to him than sport. Hence, he was an eager participant in the
Native Hunting Competition
on
God Valley
38 years ago, where he slayed the country's
king
the very instant he started protesting about having his own subjects hunted to death.
A younger Garling showed himself to be very confident in his abilities, claiming that his incurrence of a 10,000-point penalty during the aforesaid hunting contest (for starting early) was a good handicap to make things competitive. When the
Rocks
and
Roger Pirates
made landfall on God Valley, Garling was unperturbed and ready to take on the pirates despite both crews being the strongest of their time, highlighting his aplomb disposition.
Upon joining the ranks of the
Five Elders
, Garling was quick to establish himself as an equal to the other four, immediately speaking to them in a non-deferential tone despite his newcomer status, and expressed confidence in the Elders' joint pursuit to better the world and re-establish order in the face of imminent global chaos and rebellion.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As Supreme Commander of the
God's Knights
, Garling held authority over the rest of the group and could pass judgment upon his fellow
World Nobles
for behavior deemed intolerable, making him one of the most eminent Celestial Dragons.
With his ascension to one of the
Five Elders
, Garling has become one of the five "Highest Authorities in the World" who wield unrivaled influence over
world
politics and government operations, second only to
Imu
's.
Among other things, Garling's Elder status grants him the second-highest command (below
Jewelry Bonney
's) over all
Kuma
-model
Pacifistas
as well as the highest command over the
Seraphim
;
additionally, the Vegapunk
York
, with her considerable scientific prowess, has been assigned as Garling's subordinate.
If, as the Warrior God of Science and Defense, Garling himself has any scientific expertise like his predecessor Saturn is unclear.
Little is currently known about Garling's combat prowess. However, given his leadership of the God's Knights whom
Monkey D. Dragon
(head of the
Revolutionary Army
) is wary of,
plus him being deemed a worthy candidate to be one of the Five Elders (all of whom have proven exceedingly powerful),
it can be assumed that Garling is quite dangerous, at least by World Noble standards.
Garling is said to have been a "champion" of
God Valley
.
On said island 38 years ago, he was the World Nobles' favorite to win their
Native Hunting Competition
in which, despite starting with a negative 10,000 points,
Garling successfully took the lead prior to the contest's interruption.
When both the
Rocks
and
Roger Pirates
(two of the strongest
pirate
crews of that era) arrived on God Valley, Garling was ready to take on the enemy with his fellow God's Knights;
apart from his survival, what involvement Garling ultimately had in the
God Valley Incident
is still unknown.
During the Native Hunting Competition, Garling was seen riding some sort of large, flightless bird wearing an aviator cap.
Weapons
[
]
Garling using his saber to kill the King of God Valley.
Garling's trademark
weapon
is a large, single-edged
saber
with a circular, golden knuckle-bow guard, a hilt wrapped in purple leather and/or wire, a buttoned pommel also in gold, and a solid-black sheath accented with two golden bands near the guard.
Garling already possessed this blade 38 years ago on God Valley,
but his skill with the weapon remains unknown.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Garling indiscriminately hunting down God Valley's natives.
Thirty-eight years ago, Garling (already part of the
God's Knights
) took part in the
Native Hunting Competition
hosted on
God Valley
, where he executed the former
king
of the island for protesting the game and having his own countrymen culled for sport. This action led to Garling receiving a 10,000-point demerit for killing before the timer started, but Garling did not care and saw it as a suitable "handicap" to improve competition.
Following an announcement about how many points the different hunting targets ("Rabbits") awarded and the prizes awaiting the winners, Garling was quick to enter the contest and amass 100,000 points by going for the high-value Rabbits. Once both the
Rocks
and
Roger Pirates
had made landfall on God Valley in a surprise assault, an irritated Garling issued the order to pull back the
Marines
and have them guard the Celestial Dragons instead, noting that the God's Knights were to handle the
pirates
instead.
Though details on his involvement in the
God Valley Incident
remain unknown, Garling was eventually declared a "champion" of God Valley.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
Following the most recent
Levely
, Garling acted as a judge against Saint
Donquixote Mjosgard
, who was accused of abetting the escape of the
pirates
suspected of Saint
Charlos
's attempted murder. Garling chose to execute Mjosgard for protecting "trash" and was subsequently seen lounging in a chair at the execution site in
Mary Geoise
, with cheering Celestial Dragons around.
Later, Garling calmly listened to
Vegapunk
's pre-recorded worldwide message as the
scientist
spoke about the
One Piece
.
Following the events of the
Egghead Incident
, Garling received "orders" to become the new Warrior God of Science and Defense among the
Five Elders
(unbeknownst to the other Elders), effectively displacing
Jaygarcia Saturn
in his duties. After arriving in the Room of Authority, Garling proclaimed that
York
was now under his purview, before alerting his fellow Elders to prepare themselves for an imminent wave of chaos and uncertainty regarding the future of the
world
.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
While he was called God Valley's "ruler" in
Chapter 1086
's initial
VIZ
translation, Garling's
ōja
(
王者
?
)
designation does not typically refer to a literal
king
, rather denoting a kingly figure or "champion"; additionally, Garling was said to "have participated/been active"
(
活躍した
,
katsuyaku shita
?
)
on
God Valley
. This was later revised in the VIZ translation to instead call him a "dominating figure" who "distinguished himself" at God Valley, which is more in line with the actual circumstances revealed
9 chapters later
.
