Gedatsu's Accidental Blue-Sea Life
[
]
While digging around and looking for a hot spring under the ground, Goro suddenly encountered Gedatsu after the latter fell down from
Skypiea
.
Together, the two went about digging for the hot spring. After countless attempts, Goro and Gedatsu come across the
Dirt Boss
, and with his help, they finally succeed in locating the hot spring.
Afterwards, they came across the
Forest Boss
, who also began to help build the hot spring resort.
However, while digging, the Dirt Boss accidentally brought Goro and Gedatsu back to an oasis in Arabasta. By coincidence, the oasis happened to be
Yuba
, where his brother Toto and nephew Koza lived.
Afterwards, he went back to his island alongside Toto, Koza, and
Karoo
to inspect the progress of the hot spring resort.
To their surprise, the Forest Boss and his fellow baboons had already completed building the entire resort.
As such, he then set about opening the tunnel that would connect Arabasta to his resort island.
He would then employ
Hasami
to act as the transportation through the tunnels.
After returning to the island, he and the others enjoyed the hot springs alongside
Pell
,
Igaram
,
Chaka
, and the rest of the
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
.
As such, with Gedatsu's help, Goro was finally able to open the hot springs resort of his lifelong dream.
