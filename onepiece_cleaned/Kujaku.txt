Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
Kujaku was present at
G-14
with
Prince Grus
when they were approached by fellow
SWORD
members
Helmeppo
and
Hibari
regarding the abduction of
Koby
.
Kujaku moves buildings for a planned attack.
Later, Kujaku joined
Garp
's operation to rescue
Koby
from
Hachinosu
. After landing on the island, she
forced the buildings
to clear out a large area, encircling the
pirates
and making way for Garp to attack from above.
She later observed Koby approaching the battleship alongside Prince Grus, commenting on Garp's attack's impact on the town as well as on Prince Grus's ambitions to sabotage Koby and was later shocked when
Kuzan
froze
Hibari.
During the battle with the Blackbeard pirates, Kujaku requested Garp via Den Den Mushi for the sitrep while boarding on the Marine ship. She also informed him that all of the captured citizens and injured Marines have all set out, so they can leave whenever. Hibari, who was defrosted, asked about Koby and apologized for being a nuisance. Kujaku reassured her that Koby and the others will come back while expressing relief of her welfare as she comforted Hibari, who ended up feeling emotional.
At the same time
Avalo Pizarro
attempted to use his
devil fruit ability
to destroy the marine ship the fellow marines and Kujaku were onboard of to her horror. While she initially gave the order to abandon ship
Koby
managed to land a powerful blow on pizarro defeating him before he could reach the ship. As Koby boarded the ship Garp relayed to Kujaku and the other marines onboard to sail off without him now that Koby was rescued while he stayed behind as he was surrounded by the Blackbeard pirates and was frozen again by Kuzan.
Kujaku listens to Vegapunk's broadcast as her allies recover.
Sometime later, the group would eventually make it to the
Marine GS General Hospital
for medical attention. Kujaku used this time to meet with
X Drake
. Later, she would listen in to
Vegapunk
's broadcast to the world alongside her allies, commenting that Drake was recovering fine, but wanted to be left alone. Upon hearing Grus mention his dissatisfaction with the likely unfortunate news they would soon receive, she commented that they would be ready to step up whenever needed.
