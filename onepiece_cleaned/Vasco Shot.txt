Appearance
[
]
Vasco Shot is a huge man, three times a normal man's height;
of the Blackbeard Pirates' core members, his size is second only to
Sanjuan Wolf
's. He is stocky, overly top-heavy in build with thick arms, proportionate to his torso, that reach knee level, looking massive compared to his disproportionally shorter, thinner legs.
Shot has light skin with a red undertone, an extremely wide neck, and on top an unattractive face that is set most apart by his big, bulbous nose: uniform in its thickness, protruding down over his mouth and slightly frontward, with small, nearly unseen nose wings and a strange placement: its bridge starting higher than Shot's eyes are set. The latter are widely spaced beside his nose, drooping, with purplish-gray irises underlined by black lines (more prominent in the manga) that jut upward from the outer eye corners like lashes, and being topped by what seem to be thin, short brows always drawn downward, touching the nose's upper edge. Otherwise, Shot is seen with a perpetual, drunken smile, his mouth gaping wide, exposing his big, rounded teeth, with his tongue sticking out, salivating, thickening the apples of his cheeks (marked by blush marks), and forming prominent chin folds. His tall, rounded forehead is furrowed, with a black jester's hat above whose two cones bend over, and are tipped by white pompoms. Behind, his black, waved hair comes out to go down his back, and placed upon the sides of his neck (three on each) are large, golden ring piercings.
True to his moniker, Shot is always seen chugging on a large, yellowish gourd of liquor strapped on his back by a rope, which has the kanji 酒
(
sake
?
, "alcohol")
on its bottom section. Clothes-wise, beside his hat, he has only been seen donning the basic Impel Down prison uniform, comprising a long-sleeved shirt and shorts striped black-and-white, plus white slip-on shoes.
Midway through the
Egghead Arc
, Shot's design changed from his previous appearance at
Amazon Lily
. He now wears dark lipstick and has a small star tattoo on the left-side of his forehead, as well as a darkened nose. His outfit now consists of a black feathered coat, worn over diamond-patterned overalls.
Personality
[
]
As his epithet suggests, Shot's general bearing is that of a nonchalant, somewhat dopey drunk; having yet to be seen in a sober state, how strongly inebriation affects his personality is unknown. He does seem to hate the idea of sobering up, as he at one point suggested to
his crew
that they invade a town somewhere solely because he had run out of booze.
However, Shot's apparent goofiness seems to bely his viciousness, which is established by the supposed cruelty of his crimes that led to his bygone imprisonment; said to be of outstanding brutality even by the standards of
Impel Down's Level 6
prisoners,
and as a result of which his very existence had to be erased from history.
Upon his crew's arrival at the
Summit War of Marineford
, Shot was seen asking for permission to kill everyone present at the scene, suggesting a lust for violence.
Vasco Shot has displayed a lecherous nature such as when he tried to dissuade Devon from killing
Boa Hancock
, suggesting that they could have fun with her if they took her away. He also felt enough lust towards Boa Hancock to be affected by her
Devil Fruit ability
.
Shot, like many characters, has a signature
laughter style
: "Toputoputopu"
(
トプトプトプ
?
)
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Over the two-year timeskip, Shot has become one of
Blackbeard
's "Ten Titanic Captains" who personally guard the
Emperor
,
acquiring great authority in the crew as captain of its eighth ship.
Little is yet known about what Shot is capable of in combat. However, he is strong enough to have been contained in Level 6 of Impel Down where the world's worst, most dangerous criminals are held, and
Emporio Ivankov
considers him very notorious.
Indeed, Vasco was among the strongest Level 6 inmates at the time of his confinement, as when Blackbeard recruited him alongside other prisoners, he chose only those who could survive when pitted against all other Level 6 inmates in a free-for-all battle royale.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Shot is shown to have impressive endurance, displayed when he took a
quake shockwave
from
Whitebeard
(albeit launched from afar rather than a direct hit)
and thereafter one of the energy shockwaves from
Sengoku
's
Daibutsu Form
, and seemingly recovered swiftly each time.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Gabu Gabu no Mi
Shot ate the Gabu Gabu no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
with alcohol-based powers. He has demonstrated the ability to take advantage of alcohol's flammable properties and attack with fire, but beyond that, the full capabilities of his powers are currently unknown.
Weapons
[
]
Shot was wielded a pistol while he was participating in the killing of Whitebeard. In the anime, he carried dual pistols.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Vasco Shot, once one of the most feared criminals in the world, was eventually caught by the
World Government
and given a life sentence in
Impel Down
's Level 6, whereby he was effectively erased from history.
During his stay in the prison, he was very infamous among prisoners for his crimes, which were deemed incredibly brutal even compared to those committed by fellow inmates.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Impel Down Arc
[
]
When the
Blackbeard Pirates
invaded Impel Down, Shot fought to the death with the inmates of his cell under
Marshall D. Teach
's orders, and being victorious, was given freedom and recruited into the crew.
Marineford Arc
[
]
The Blackbeard Pirates dealing the death blow to Edward Newgate.
Shot eventually arrived with the Blackbeard Pirates, including fellow Level 6 inmates who had been recruited, at the
ongoing war
at
Marineford
to watch
Whitebeard
die.
Shortly after Whitebeard had launched a
quake shockwave
at the crew and then started engaging in battle with Blackbeard, Shot joined his comrades in brutally assaulting Whitebeard, who Shot personally started barraging with bullets.
After Whitebeard had died, Shot assisted his fellow crewmates in covering Whitebeard's lifeless body in a black cloth, then guarding Blackbeard as he somehow stole Whitebeard's
Devil Fruit
powers beneath the cloth and subsequently emerged to demonstrate his newly acquired ability.
Shot was then, along with the rest of his crew, attacked with a shockwave sent out by
Sengoku
in his
giant Buddha form
.
Eventually, after
Shanks
had arrived to intervene in the war and end it, Shot left with his crewmates on their captain's order.
Post-War Arc
[
]
Shot with the Blackbeard Pirates waiting for the delivery of a Marine ship.
The Blackbeard Pirates later made their move in the
New World
,
taking out
Jewelry Bonney
in the process. When the crew was seen bickering amongst each other while dwelling on a fiery island, Shot complained that he was running out of alcohol, and that they should next travel to an island with a town to get more.
The Blackbeard Pirates' raft
had been brought close to the point of destruction due to
Sanjuan Wolf
's size, and they had gotten in contact with the Marines to trade Jewelry Bonney for a battleship.
Van Augur
then alerted Teach that the battleship had arrived, but not for trade because
Akainu
was aboard. Knowing that the deal would not happen, the Blackbeard Pirates fled, leaving Bonney and her crew behind to be captured.
During the Timeskip
[
]
One year after the war at Marineford, the Blackbeard Pirates
fought against
the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates, with their respective allies, and ultimately won.
The Blackbeard Pirates used their Teach's intimate knowledge of Whitebeard's former territory to conquer it. With Teach having become one of the
Four Emperors
, the Blackbeard Pirates have begun hunting down powerful
Devil Fruit
users in order to kill them and steal their abilities.
At some point, the Blackbeard Pirates expanded and Vasco Shot became one of the Ten Titanic Captains, leading the eighth ship of the fleet.
When the crew encountered
Kuzan
on some island, Shot was among the several other Blackbeard Pirates that were
frozen
during the confrontation.  After Shot and the others were thawed out, they all started drinking and laughing as they talked about the
man with the burn scar
and how he possesses the fourth and final
Road Poneglyph
that would help lead them to
Laugh Tale
. Shot was frozen again after Kuzan thought the pirates were planning to kill him in order to steal his Devil Fruit power. However, after clearing up the misunderstanding, Teach managed to convince the former Marine Admiral into joining the crew.
Following the events of the
Rocky Port Incident
the Blackbeard Pirates made the island
Hachinosu
their base of operations.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Zou Arc
[
]
The Blackbeard Pirates eventually attacked
Baltigo
, where the
Revolutionary Army
was headquartered, due to
Jesus Burgess
's discovery of said island. Baltigo had been left destroyed by the time the
Marines
and
Cipher Pol
arrived, but the Revolutionary Army had managed to escape. The Blackbeard Pirates fled after briefly clashing with Cipher Pol.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Shot and Devon petrified by Hancock.
Following the dissolution of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, Shot accompanied his captain, along with
Catarina Devon
, to
Amazon Lily
so Blackbeard could claim
Boa Hancock's
Devil Fruit
powers. While Devon wanted to take Hancock's head as a trophy, Shot wanted to keep her alive for his own lechery. During the battle, they were petrified by the
Mero Mero no Mi
, but thanks to the intervention of
Silvers Rayleigh
, Shot was returned to normal and was forced to leave the island with his crew.
He later returned with Teach to
Hachinosu
after they abducted
Koby
and was present when Blackbeard told Koby about his plans to turn Hachinosu into a kingdom and listened to Kuzan explaining the nature of
SWORD
.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
Shot spits fire at Garp using his powers.
Days later, Koby had managed to escape the prison and after
Avalo Pizarro
managed to pinpoint the location of the breakout, Vasco Shot suggested to set the fire on town to cut off the prisoner's escape route, although he was scolded by Pizarro for that idea. He then watched when
Garp
arrived with a Marine ship and attacked Hachinosu.
When Garp wreaked havoc on the island, Vasco Shot was unimpressed by Garp's title, doubting his strength, using his Devil Fruit powers to spit flames at Garp who shielded himself from the flames with surrounding pirates.
After SWORD escaped with Koby, Shot and fellow Titanic Captains surround an injured and nearly frozen Garp.
Elbaph Arc
[
]
Shot listens in on a meeting with his crew.
Sometime later, following Teach's return to Hachinosu, Shot sat silently as his captain threatened and berated Pizarro for his failure to prevent Moria and Koby's escapes. Teach eventually calmed down after finding out they had gained Garp in exchange, and Shot sat in on the meeting amongst his crew as Teach plotted their next actions.
