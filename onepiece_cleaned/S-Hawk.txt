Seraphim
and a
clone
of
Dracule Mihawk
.

Egghead Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
S-Hawk's pupils.
S-Hawk resembles Mihawk as a child, but is significantly larger in size. He also possesses
lunarian
traits, such as brown skin, black wings, and white hair.
His irises have additional rings similar to Mihawk's, but his pupils are star-shaped like the other Seraphim. A section of his right forearm is replaced by a tube that is filled with
Green Blood
.
Personality
[
]
S-Hawk has not displayed any personality outside of his obedience to the
Marines
and
Vegapunk
and aggression towards his designated targets.
Zoro has regarded S-Hawk as possessing more humanity than the original Dracule Mihawk.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
S-Hawk is one of the Seraphim, which Vegapunk describes as the pinnacle of his scientific achievements and the "Strongest Form of Humanity."
Pacifista Body
[
]
Like other
Pacifista
, S-Hawk was given the ability to fire
lasers
from his palm as a result of Vegapunk's research.
Fire Manipulation
[
]
As an artificial
lunarian
, S-Hawk possesses flames on his back that are linked to his tremendous resilience as a lunarian.
S-Hawk is sturdy enough to withstand Blackbeard's attack, and also a combined attack from
Roronoa Zoro
and
Kaku
.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Like the original Mihawk, S-Hawk is an extremely skilled
swordsman
. His attack forced
Blackbeard
to use
Armament Haki
for defense and sliced off a large portion of
Amazon Lily
's central mountain.
He was also able to hold his own against
Roronoa Zoro
, a very skilled swordsman with a bounty over a billion.
Devil Fruit

Main article:
Supa Supa no Mi
S-Hawk turns his leg into a blade.
Via the
Green Blood
, S-Hawk possesses an artificial version of
Daz Bonez
's Supa Supa no Mi, allowing him to turn any part of his body into sharp steel blades. He has used this ability to transform his leg into blade to augment his kicks and create a ranged slicing attack.
In the Anime, S-Hawk's usage of the Supa Supa no Mi mirrors that of Daz Bonez, as like him he attacks with a variety of hand to hand techniques that are enhanced by the effects of his Devil Fruit. Also like Daz Bonez, He also has the ability to sprout blades on his feet, allowing him to skate on solid ground as if it were ice.
Weapons
[
]
S-Hawk wields a sword very similar to
Yoru
, the only difference being the blade is not black.
Haki

Haki
S-Hawk is able to use
Observation
and
Armament Haki
.
History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
S-Hawk facing the Blackbeard Pirates.
S-Hawk was brought to
Amazon Lily
together with
S-Snake
for the mission of capturing
Boa Hancock
. During the battle, he clashed with the invading Blackbeard and ended up cutting off a large portion of the island. After the majority of the
Marines
were
petrified
,
Koby
ordered S-Hawk to stop firing lasers to prevent damage to the statues. S-Hawk received no visible injuries during the mission, but was eventually withdrawn by order of the Marines.
Some time later, S-Hawk returned to
Egghead
.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
S-Hawk defending Egghead.
Weeks later, upon
CP0
infiltrating Egghead in order to kill Vegapunk and his satellites,
Shaka
had S-Hawk, S-Snake, and
S-Shark
deployed under the command of
Sentomaru
.
While
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Rob Lucci
began fighting, the three Seraphim met up with Sentomaru. The group encountered the invading government agents, during which Sentomaru instructed both S-Hawk and S-Shark to hold back CP0 while S-Snake assisted the
Straw Hat Pirates
with fleeing with Vegapunk.
Obeying Sentomaru's commands, the three Seraphim were joined by
S-Bear
with assaulting the government agents until Sentomaru succumbed to his injuries, resulting in the four Seraphim following CP0's command.
S-Hawk's attempted ambush on Lilith is stopped by Zoro.
Upon CP0 infiltrating Egghead's Labohase while its defense system was deactivated, the four Serapim took the initative to follow the assassins. When they arrived, Lucci ordered them to destroy Vegapunk's laboratory before he comes out, leading to them damaging the building's structure using a range of attacks.
When
Lilith
came out of the lab to command them to cease their attacks, S-Hawk was aiming at her, ready to strike at her, only to be interrupted and engaged in a sword clash with
Roronoa Zoro
, who remarked his similarities towards Mihawk. When
Edison
commanded all the Seraphim to stand down, S-Hawk followed the order.
S-Hawk is attacked by Zoro and Kaku.
While Vegapunk's Satellites and
Straw Hat Pirates
searched for the missing Stella within the Labophase, S-Hawk and S-Bear began targeting Kaku and Lucci while they were restrained and unconscious, prompting Zoro to get assistance from Luffy to confront them. Joined by
Shaka
, the two Seraphim were unaffected by his order to stop, and continued their attacks.
The pressure of the CP0 being targeted leads to them being freed by the Straw Hats to fight the Seraphim, resulting in Zoro and
Kaku
engaging S-Hawk in combat,
but they are unable to do any lasting damage to S-Hawk.
S-Hawk then left to go for the weaker targets.
At some point, he and the other Seraphim were captured in
seastone
bubbles and left in the laboratory's basement with the imprisoned
Cipher pol
agents.
After
Nusjuro
cut the Labophase, S-Hawk, the other Seraphim, and the imprisoned Cipher Pol agents all fell to the Fabiriophase.
