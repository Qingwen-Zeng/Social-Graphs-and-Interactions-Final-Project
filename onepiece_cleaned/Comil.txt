.
Appearance
[
]
Comil is a tall, large man with a bald top, but blonde spiky hair flowing downwards on the back of his head, similar to
Shiki
. He has a mustache and is dark-skinned. His mustache looks like what one usually gets after drinking milk.
He dresses in the typical garb of many high-ranking Marines: he sports a maroon, double-breasted suit over a dark-green shirt with a plain green tie, and also has a
Marine
coat draped over his shoulders like a cape.
Personality
[
]
Comil cares deeply for his subordinates, assisting the one
Ace
saved from the fire as soon as he could. He also seems to enjoy the little things, smiling happily after
Moda
sent him some milk to make the coffee served in his base taste better (which he, along with the base's personnel, hated).
His
Upheld Justice

Ace's Great Blackbeard Search

Comil's administrative meetings were plagued by bitter coffee, which
Portgas D. Ace
witnessed firsthand when he infiltrated the base posing as a Marine officer.
Though Ace's cover was blown, he ended up saving the day by reuniting the milk-maiden
Moda
with her parents on the base's grocery ship. This ensured a steady supply of milk to
G-2
, as well as pleasant meetings with good tasting coffee for the vice admiral.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
His name is a portmanteau of the Japanese pronunciations for "coffee"
(
コーヒー
,
kōhī
?
)
and "milk"
(
ミルク
,
miruku
?
)
, an obvious reference to his drink preferences. In both the
Viz manga
and the 7th
popularity poll
, it is romanized
Komille
.
