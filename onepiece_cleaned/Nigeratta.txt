History

Shortly after Robin escaped from

While Robin worked hard and honestly for the couple and thought she found a place to stay, Nigeratta and his wife one night were talking about turning her in. Robin overheard their plot and escaped. The couple went to look for her, with Nigeratta even holding a rifle, and selfishly accusing Robin of being an ungrateful little girl, betraying his and his wife's kindness.
