Yasopp
,
known as
"Chaser"
,
is one of the
Senior Officers
and the
sniper
of the
Red Hair Pirates
.
He is also the father of
Usopp
and the widower of
Banchina
.
Appearance
[
]
His appearance is very similar to his son, Usopp. However, his shorter nose and blond hair do not match Usopp's longer nose and darker hair, both of which are hereditary traits of Usopp's mother.
Twenty years ago, Yasopp had the same tight curls and black hair as Usopp,
and in
Romance Dawn
, his hair was styled in loose waves,
but later appearances show him with it in dreadlocks. In addition to that, his body was slimmer while in his latest appearance,
it seems to have become more muscular.
His name was written on his headband,
while in his latest appearance, he has no headband, and his name is written on his upper right arm.
During his time in
Foosha Village
, he wore a dark-blue shirt, dark-green pants reaching down to his calves, and blue shoes with buckles on them. He donned his headband at this time.
At
Marineford
, he sports a dark A-shirt, short pants, standard boots, and a large belt with a bag attached to it. There is also a little necklace around his neck. He retains his trademark star-patterned cape, and he has his rifle attached to his back via a band.
Personality
[
]
He shares many personality traits with his son, including being able to encourage the rest of his crew to join in with his fun. He is very proud of his son, Usopp, to the point where he would often talk about his son over and over again to
Luffy
, which led Luffy to recognize Usopp on sight from Yasopp's stories alone. During his time in Luffy's village, Yasopp felt close to Luffy because he is the same age as his son whom he left at home.
However, he does not tolerate disrespect towards his captain or his crew as he was shooting and destroying the
Going Luffy-senpai
with the
Barto Club
on it due to
Bartolomeo
having burned down the Red-Hair-Pirates to replace it with Luffy's Jolly Roger, despite Shanks seemingly letting them set off unharmed.

Usopp
[
]
Yasopp is
Usopp
's father. Usopp does not know much about his father, only that he is a member of Shanks' pirate crew. Even though Yasopp abandoned Usopp as a baby to become a pirate, he genuinely loves his son. This feeling is mutual, as Usopp loves, admires, respects and is very proud of his father for being a pirate. When Kuro insulted his father, Usopp punched him with all his strength and declared that he had nothing but pure pride in his father being a pirate, and who was very proud to be the son of a pirate.
It is said by Merry back at Syrup Village that Usopp started lying that pirates were coming to the village, hoping that his father would come back when his mother fell ill.
While the Red-Haired Pirates were docked at
Windmill Village
, Yasopp often spoke fondly of his son to a young
Monkey D. Luffy
.
Usopp greatly respects his father and has inherited his phenomenal marksmanship.
It was later revealed that Yasopp now knows about his son being a member of the
Straw Hat Pirates
to the point where he is nervous about reuniting with him.
Banchina
[
]
Banchina
was Yasopp's wife. Banchina was the one who persuaded her husband to leave home and fulfill his dream to become a pirate. He did so and left her and their son to join
Shanks
twelve years ago. Banchina was proud of her husband and admired his courage.
Crew
[
]
Shanks
[
]
Yasopp first met Shanks in
Syrup Village
two years after Gol D. Roger's execution. Shanks had heard of Yasopp's sniping skills and recruited Yasopp to join his crew. Yasopp is shown to be very loyal to his captain and is close enough to be one of his officers. He enjoys partying with him and the rest of the crew.
Friends
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Yasopp once showed off his sniping skills to a young Luffy, and often talked about his son, Usopp to him. Luffy became tired of listening to his stories of Usopp, and Yasopp responded by shoving a drink glass over his head before proceeding to tell yet another story.

His reputation was such that when Shanks was looking for potential crew members, he sought out Yasopp who had apparently already made quite a name for himself.

Sometime later, the Red Hair Pirates made their way to
one of their territories
, in order to punish Bartolomew for burning their flag. Bartolomeo apologized profusely for his actions, while Hongo gave him a task: kill Luffy within a month using poison, and all would be forgiven. Bartolomeo outright denied the request and drank the apparent poison on his own, proclaiming that his loyalty to Luffy was worth more than his own life. As the poison was fake, Bartolomeo was shocked rather than dead. Shanks would then allow Bartolomeo to leave, which he and
his crew
quickly did. However, in order to teach them a lesson, Yasopp fired on their ship, blowing it up.

Early Concepts
[
]
Yasopp seems to have been the final draft of a headband wearing crew member that appeared in several panels in the original
Romance Dawn
. Yasopp also has a similar pose in a panel that was reused in the final version. The panel was mirrored in the final version, so Yasopp is on the opposite side of his Romance Dawn V.1 counterpart, although his pose itself is not mirrored. Similarly, both he and the Romance Dawn head band wearing member were also helping load supplies when it came time for the crew to leave in both stories.
A panel from the first version Romance Dawn V.1...
...and a similar panel from the final version used in One Piece.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime only, Yasopp revealed during a duel with
Daddy Masterson
that he had been a hopeless father who was unable to do anything for his
wife
and son.
Luigia
has stated that Yasopp was a liar when he was young.
During the Marineford Arc, he attempted to fight the Blackbeard Pirates by showing his gun in a threatening manner to
Van Augur
.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Yasopp was (alongside
Zeff
) inserted into
4Kids'
heavily-truncated version of the
Reverse Mountain Arc
as a means of establishing the
"Grand Compass"
without
Laboon
or
Crocus
. Here, the compass is depicted as something that Yasopp left in
Syrup Village
to help Usopp become a pirate, as explained via a "flashback" created with footage from
Episode 9
. While not a plot hole in itself, it should be noted that
canon
indicates nothing about Yasopp wanting Usopp to go out to sea so early.
The 4Kids dub also removed the writing on his bandanna, as it did with most in-universe writing.
