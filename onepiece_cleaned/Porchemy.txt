Bluejam Pirates

Bluejam
for losing to Ace and Sabo.
Appearance
[
]
Porchemy was a very large man with long whitish blue hair, narrow eyebrow-less eyes, and a broad chest with an open red, ruffle-edged vest. He had tattoos on his left bicep and wore an earring on each ear. He also wore a yellow sash with stripes around his waist and a belt over it. He wore regular pants and boots. He was seen carrying a large sword as well.
Personality
[
]
He was not easily fooled, as he could tell
Luffy
was lying.
He was seemingly a ruthless pirate, due to his intolerance of Luffy and the degree of violence he used to interrogate Luffy to talk, along with Sabo's claim that he skins the heads of those he fights.
He appeared to have some sense of pride for his status as a pirate, as he said that "he will quit being a pirate" if he is beaten by kids.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
He appeared to have some knowledge about
Devil Fruits
, as he did not appear shocked learning about Luffy's powers and quickly decided on a method that could harm Luffy.
Weapons
[
]
He wields a sword, resembling a cutlass, and is skilled enough to cut an iron pipe with it. Despite this, he was defeated by the combined efforts of Ace and Sabo.
He also had spiked gloves to increase the damage done from his punches and was strong enough to wield a very large mallet. Both of those weapons were only shown for torturing Luffy though.
History
[
]
Porchemy torturing Luffy to reveal the location of Ace and Sabo's hidden loot.
12 years before the current storyline, he and two of his crewmates searched for
Ace
following the latter's theft of some of their treasure. He managed to catch
Luffy
, who was trying to escape from Ace and
Sabo
. Luffy called out Ace's name for help but when Porchemy asked about where the treasure was that Ace stole, Luffy attempted to lie his way out, but Porchemy easily saw through it and took Luffy away.
Sometime later, he atttepmted to convince Luffy to speak by coercion, first unsuccessfully using a large mallet and later with spiked gloves. After he switched to a sword and was about to murder Luffy for not giving him the information he needed, he was attacked and defeated by Sabo and Ace, who came back to rescue Luffy. After his failure, his captain,
Bluejam
, disgusted by his weakness, shot and killed him.
