.
Tyrannosaurus
is the name of a small mouse that
Iceburg
found and takes care of.
Appearance
[
]
Tyrannosaurus is a small, white mouse, with a long hairless tail, red eyes, and a cheerful look on its face.
Most of the time it stands on his rear legs, keeping its front legs raised in a standard mouse pose somewhat resembling a
Tyrannosaurus Rex
, which probably gave it the name.
After the two-year timeskip, it wore a miniature pinstriped suit jacket over a dark-colored shirt and light-colored tie.
Personality
[
]
Tyrannosaurus spends most of its time lying in Iceburg's breast pocket and squeaking happily when Iceburg caresses him.
It is apparently very loyal and attached to Iceburg, as it is always seen with him. During the fire at
Galley-La Company
's headquarters, instead of running away, it remained by its master's side, trying to wake him up with squeaks in order to save him.

Tyrannosaurus is always seen together with Iceburg; it appeared the first time in his pocket, when
Mikazuki
was bothering
Paulie
at Dock 1, before being defeated by him and the other carpenters along with his crew.
When Iceburg met the
Straw Hat Pirates
, he said that he had recently picked up this mouse and then gave it the name Tyrannosaurus. He requested
Kalifa
to get Tyrannosaurus some rodent food and a cage, which she had already done for him.
During Iceburg's convalescence, it was always by his side, standing on his bed.
Later, during the fire at the company's headquarters at the hands of the
CP9
, instead of running away, it tried to wake up Iceburg, without success. It, alongside his master and Paulie, were fortunately saved by
Tony Tony Chopper
