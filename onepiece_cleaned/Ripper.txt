Commander Ripper
is an
East Blue
Marine
who heads the
153rd Branch
. Formerly a subordinate of
Morgan
, he assumed control after Morgan was defeated by the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Ripper is an average man who wears the normal marine hat, shirt, and pants. However, his ascot is a light green instead of dark blue. He has tanned skin, brown hair, a pronounced jawline, and a brown mustache and beard.
After the timeskip, he now wears the Marine officer coat.
When he was still a young Marine, he did not have a beard.
Personality
[
]
He appears to be a devoted, yet understanding Marine, as he asked Luffy and Zoro to leave
Shells Town
nicely, instead of just capturing them. He also pretended to not know that Koby and the pirates were friends. He also appears to be relatively trusting since he was willing to let Koby join their ranks even though he knew of Koby's past as a pirate.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a Marine, Ripper is able to use a gun. Not much else is known of Ripper's abilities, or how strong he may be. However, as a Marine Commander, he has jurisdiction over his subordinates.
History
[
]
East Blue Saga
[
]
Romance Dawn Arc
[
]
After
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Roronoa Zoro
defeated
Morgan
, Ripper led a unit to question them at
Rika
's house. Though grateful to them for ending Morgan's tyranny over
Shells Town
, Ripper nevertheless asked them to leave (much to the townspeople's outrage), maintaining that Marines could not knowingly shelter pirates; to compensate, he promised to leave their involvement unreported to his superiors.
While Luffy and Zoro agreed to leave without complaint, their companion
Koby
became conflicted, as he had long dreamed of joining the Marines. Suspicious, Ripper began questioning Koby over his relation to the pirates. In response, Luffy deliberately provoked Koby into a brawl to "prove" their lack of friendship; though not actually fooled, Ripper was impressed by the gesture, and accepted Koby as a recruit.
As Koby saluted the departing Straw Hats, Ripper and his unit surprisingly joined in, and commended Koby on their bond. Ripper then acknowledged this was a violation of Marine code, and penalized the unit—himself included—a week's worth of meal privileges.

Ripper later escorted Morgan to be handed off to Vice Admiral
Garp
for a court-martial. He was present when Garp arrived to take Morgan.
However, in the end, Morgan ends up escaping by slicing Garp and holding
Helmeppo
hostage.
Later he visited Rika and informed of Koby and informed her of Koby and Helmeppo being recruited by Garp and witnesses her crying over it.

Ripper after the timeskip with his new uniform.
After the timeskip, Ripper is seen eating at the canteen alongside
Rokkaku
and informing
Rika
of the return of
Luffy
and
Zoro
. He now wears a Marine officer's coat, as opposed to when he used to wear the standard Marine uniform. It is unknown if this signified a promotion in the two years since Morgan's downfall.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The anime reduces his penalty for saluting a pirate from one week to three days (a change that is, curiously, reverted in the
4Kids-dubbed anime
).
His role in the anime version of
Diary of Koby-Meppo
is slightly expanded. He is seen training Marines right before Koby and Helmeppo accidentally cause a cannon fire.
Later, when he is escorting Morgan, he is in constant surprise at Garp falling asleep. When the Vice Admiral gets slashed by Morgan, he is seen in surprise that Garp had fallen asleep and not known he was attacked. He also apologizes to the Vice Admiral that Morgan escaped and states that Koby and Helmeppo would be kicked out after indirectly helping in Morgan's escape. To his surprise once again, Garp decides to take the two along with him to Headquarters.
