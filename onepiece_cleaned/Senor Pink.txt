and
officer
of the

.
Appearance
[
]
Senor Pink is a tall, obese man with brown eyes, large lips, dark shaggy hair, and a double chin. He wears a pink bonnet and purple aviator sunglasses, and carries a yellow pacifier in his mouth. He also wears a blue scarf with white polka dots around his neck with a pink bib underneath it. He wears a purple cut off, sleeveless shirt with the logo "Let's Baby" in yellow on it, and what appears to be small swim trunks with stars all over it that are folded over to resemble a diaper. The baby outfit is a homage to his late infant son.
When he was 30 years old, Senor Pink was much slimmer than his present self. He wore a dark-colored suit with a floral shirt, and his hair was neatly combed, showcasing the signs of a well-dressed gentleman.
Shortly after the death of Rosinante, Pink adopted his current appearance of dressing as an infant due to it making his comatose wife smile.
By age 36, he gained extra weight after falling into depression (having started the formation of his portly figure), his shirt was light-colored and the logo "Let's Baby" was dark-colored.
In the present, it is the other way around with "Don't Cry" printed on the back.
In
SBS Volume 80
, Oda drew the Donquixote Pirates as children. Senor Pink is shown wearing a dark-colored shirt with dirty pants, and he sported numerous bruises on his face.
Personality
[
]
He is surrounded by many women who seem to be extremely fond of him. However, he claims to be too old for them; advising them to find someone younger, despite dressing himself as an infant. He is also shown to have some manner of indecency as he had no qualms about ripping a woman's bra off in order to wipe his mouth, which does not seem to deter the women's admiration of him,
and using a shoe brush to brush his teeth.
The women who admire him, as well as others, often remark he is "hard-boiled", while his male underlings equally praise how cool he tends to act.
He seems to care about his comrades, as he took a direct hit from Franky's Rocket Launcher on purpose so that
Machvise
would not take damage, as he was vulnerable after having tried to crush
Franky
.
He seems to have both a cruel and a compassionate side, calling
Sugar
useless one moment but then worrying about her safety the next.
He is also a very proud man, as he refuses to use his
ability
to run away from his enemies.
He even promised that if Franky could survive his strongest attack, he would admit defeat, a promise well kept.
That compassionate side seems to show again, as Franky was able to trick Pink into abandoning the fight when Franky lied that he heard a woman in trouble nearby. Although Pink was angry at being tricked, he was relieved there was not actually a woman in trouble.
He continues to show this side of himself such as how he protects a random cat during the middle of battle, something which made even Franky cry in admiration.
His love for his
wife
was so strong, that he would hide his pirate career from her, as she hates pirates. However, his steadfast loyalty to his crew made it impossible for him to leave them either, forcing him to juggle between his two families. When she found out and left him, he became heartbroken, and did everything to regain her smile, even if it means dressing up like their
deceased son
by wearing infant clothing. Even when everyone else laughed at him for it, calling him a pervert and believing that he became so because of his loss of his wife and son, he easily brushed it all off due to the love for his wife.
Despite dressing like a baby and sucking on a pacifier, and his love for his late son, he claims to not like children.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Pink is a loyal officer of the
Donquixote Pirates
, whom he saw as his family, sentiments that are returned faithfully, and calling
Donquixote Doflamingo
"young master". Despite his affiliation with the crew clashing with that of his wife and son's relationship, the latter both he loved very much, he refused to give up on either family, instead choosing to lie to his wife about his career and hiding the truth. Despite familial attachments with the crew, which Doflamingo stresses and forbids anyone from making fun of each other,
Diamante
and
Trebol
are not above laughing at his change in wearing infant clothes, yet he simply ignores them.
Family
[
]
Senor Pink with his wife and son.
Senor Pink once had a
wife
and a
son
. Senor Pink lied that he was a banker so his wife would not hate him due to his wife's hatred towards pirates. His relationship with his wife became strained after his son died of a fever and his wife learned that he was not a banker.
After his wife got into an accident and was reduced to a vegetative state, Senor Pink dressed like a baby because that was the only thing that made her smile. Even after her death,
Pink continues to wear the infant clothes to this day, showing a deep sign of lingering love for her.
Enemies
[
]
Franky
[
]
Despite being enemies, they developed some respect for each other during their battle at the SMILE factory. Senor Pink told Franky if he survived his finishing move, he would accept defeat, and he indeed kept his promise when Franky withstood it. Upon being defeated by Franky, the cyborg showed an interest to hear of Pink's past, should they ever meet again in the future.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Senor Pink held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members in addition to having command of 2000 soldiers. He is powerful enough to frequently participate in the
Corrida Colosseum
's tournaments, where the caliber of the fighters is very high.
It is said that when Senor Pink and the other three officers of the Diamante Army enter the tournament, they have a 100% chance of victory.
Pink is quite perceptive, as he saw through Franky's body design, and realized that the cyborg's back remains unmodified, and therefore, a glaring weakness.
Physical Abilities
[
]
He possesses great superhuman strength, as he was able to wrestle and knock down
Franky
, a very large and heavy cyborg.
He is extremely durable and has vast amounts of stamina, as he survived a direct hit from Franky's rocket with only minor injuries and burns,
and retained consciousness after being struck by Franky's Strong Hammer thirty times.
He has great skill in wrestling and hand-to-hand combat, and can use it in combination with his Devil Fruit powers to perform devastating attacks that caused extreme damage to Franky despite his cybernetically enhanced body with a strong level of resistance to even firearms and artillery.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Senor Pink eating dinner with the Family.
Senor Pink had been in
Doflamingo's crew
for at least sixteen years. The crew was once based in the
North Blue
at a port town called
Spider Miles
. Right after a 10-year old
Trafalgar Law
joined the crew, Pink was had a meal with the other members of Doflamingo's "family". The crew learned that Law was sick with the
Amber Lead
Syndrome and they listened as Law explained how he escaped the extermination of
Flevance
. While out on a raid, after
Lao G
and
Gladius
explained to
Baby 5
about the country of Flevance and how its people were inflicted with Amber Lead Syndrome, Senor Pink explained about how the country was isolated and the people were later massacred.
After
Donquixote Doflamingo
made Law an official member of the crew, the Donquixote Pirates spread their influence as they traveled to the
Grand Line
. They participated in various activities such as looting, making business deals, and collecting bounties.
While the crew was engaged in battle with the
Marines
out at sea, Senor Pink showed Doflamingo a note from
Corazon
saying he and Law left to cure Law from the Amber Lead Syndrome.
Six months after Corazon and Law left the crew, the Donquixote Pirates plotted to steal the
Ope Ope no Mi
from the
Barrels Pirates
who were going to sell it to the Marines.
They later arrived at
Minion Island
and were informed by
Vergo
of Corazon's treachery.
While Doflamingo covered part of the island in his
Birdcage
, the Donquixote Pirates raided and looted the Barrels Pirates' hideout. When they found Corazon, they viciously attacked him until Doflamingo arrived.
Buffalo
and Baby 5 later informed Doflamingo that the Marines stationed at the island took custody of a
boy
. Thinking that the boy might be Law, the Donquixote Pirates left Corazon for dead and prepared for departure. Before they left the island, they found themselves under fire by
Tsuru
's squadron.
Some time after the incident with Rosinante, Pink met a woman named
Russian
, whom he fell in love with. He kept from her that he was a
pirate
—since she hated pirates—telling her that he was a legitimate banker, and the two were ultimately married. They had a son,
Gimlet
, but he died while Pink was on business with the Donquixote Family. When Russian found out that Pink was not a banker, she ran away from him. She was later caught in a landslide, making her fall into a permanent vegetative state. Visiting her while showing regret for what happened to his son, Pink began to wear the bonnet, which made his wife smile even in her emotionless state. He ultimately adopted the bonnet and the appearance of a baby from then onward as part of the Donquixote Family.
He participated in Doflamingo's takeover of
Dressrosa
. After
Monet
opened the gates to the palace, he and the other officers of the Donquixote Pirates invaded the palace. He commented on how good the view of Dressrosa was from up in the palace.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
At the
Corrida Colosseum
, Pink was introduced as a representative for the Donquixote Pirates in the tournament for the
Mera Mera no Mi
.
He later guarded the east entrance to the
Toys House
. When
Franky
arrived, a battle ensued. After Franky dealt a large-scale damage to the building and sent many of Doflamingo's men flying, Senor Pink approached him from behind by
swimming through the ground
.
Pink engaged Franky in combat and performed a surprise attack, knocking Franky to the ground.
When Franky started shooting
his rockets
, Pink took one right in the face in order to protect
Machvise
, who was unable to move. Soon, the Marines arrived and surrounded the Toys House and Pink seemed annoyed by their presence.
The Family Donquixote and Marines defeat Franky.
Senor Pink, Machvise,
Dellinger
, and the Marines eventually defeated Franky and stood over him.
Upon hearing that
Sugar
had passed out, Pink voiced his annoyance by insulting her, calling her a brat. However, he voiced his hopes that she was not seriously injured immediately afterwards, much to the delight of his watching female fans.
Senor Pink captures Luffy.
After Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his "Birdcage" and put a price on the heads of twelve people (including Franky), Senor Pink, Machvise, and Dellinger noticed that Franky disappeared from the Toys House.
The pirate officers were surprised that the Marines were not taking any action against the Donquixote Pirates even after the truth about Doflamingo was exposed. They then saw
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Roronoa Zoro
, and Law drop down from the sky and land right in front of them. The three officers wasted no time engaging Law and the two
Straw Hat Pirates
in combat. As they attempted to run, Pink quickly swam through the ground and grabbed Luffy's leg, allowing his comrades to attack Luffy. Their battle was interrupted by the arrival of
Issho
and
Pica
, who appeared as a
massive stone giant
.
Franky slams Kyuin into Senor Pink.
After Franky reached the
SMILE Factory
and prepared to attack it with Radical Beam, Pink swam up to him and performed a suplex, preventing him from destroying the factory. Pink then stated his intent to settle the score.
Franky later claimed that there was on old lady in need of help, distracting Pink long enough for Franky and his
dwarf
group to enter the factory after it was unlocked from the inside. Once Pink realized he was tricked (simultaneously angered at being tricked, and relieved that there was nobody in need of help), he charged into the factory and Franky smashed
Kyuin
's head against Pink's. After Franky stopped Kyuin from going on a rampage, Pink continued on with his battle against him.
Franky pummels Senor Pink.
As their fight continued, both of them moved in a way that resembled synchronized swimming, while the girls and dwarves cheered around them.
Pink later took a direct punch from Franky in order to protect a cat. After making sure the cat was safe, Pink crumbled to his knees.
Pink's battle with Franky then turned into a test of will. After he willingly took a direct hit from Franky's Strong Hammer, he performed another suplex. After Franky declared to the dwarves that he would withstand every attack, Pink challenged Franky with Baby Buster. The attack failed to defeat the
cyborg
, and while taking a beating from Franky Iron Boxing, Pink thought about his wife and son. As Pink fell to the ground defeated, he shed a tear from remembering his tragic past. Franky respectfully wiped the tears before walking away.
After Doflamingo's defeat, Pink and his fellow officers were arrested by the Marines
and imprisoned in
Impel Down
. There, Senor Pink's
Lineage Factor
was extracted and used to duplicate his Devil Fruit ability in the
Seraph
S-Shark
.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Senor Pink's eyes seen clearly in the anime.
In the anime, Senor Pink's backstory is expanded to feature several new scenes. In addition, when Franky is shown dealing him the final blow, it is depicted much more poignantly than what was seen in the manga. The lens in Senor Pink's signature sunglasses fracture and shatter out and tumble away, before the frames slowly fall off his face. This reveals his eyes clearly, at which moment he notes the rain Russian enjoyed has stopped and begins to tear up. As he looks at the sky, the clouds part and sunshine pours down from above. Senor Pink sees a vision of his departed wife and child and opens his mouth to gasp, causing his pacifier to fall out. He then falls to the ground unconscious. In the manga, Senor Pink's defeat did not show his eyes clearly, only featureless blank white eyes that characters usually have upon being knocked out. His glasses and pacifier flung away abruptly, and he did not see visions of Russian and Gimlet in the sky.
