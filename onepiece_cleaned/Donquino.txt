Past

At some point, Donquino joined the Roger Pirates.
On an island in
Paradise
, the Roger Pirates defeated a battalion of Marines when they spotted the
Whitebeard Pirates
approaching them.
After the two crews battled each other for four days, Donquino participated in a gift exchange, toasting with
Blenheim
.
Not long after Oden and his family boarded the
Oro Jackson
, Donquino and his crewmates celebrated their arrival.
Donquino was present when Roger announced that he would disband the crew, and he sobbed when they dropped Roger off and again when they took Oden back to his home at Wano Country. After the Roger Pirates disbanded, it is unknown what became of Donquino.
