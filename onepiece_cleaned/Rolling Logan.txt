Rolling Logan's concept art from the anime.
Rolling Logan is a big, muscular man with tanned skin, large thick lips, and curly dark-colored hair that reaches to his shoulders. He wears a long yellow cape with purple lining held with a brooch, a black pair of briefs, leather boots, and a pair of red gloves.
He has a torso and arms that appear to be rather disproportionate compared to his legs.
Personality
[
]
He is a brutal man as he enjoyed crushing his opponents.
In the anime, he is sadistic and hungry for positive attention, bragging about how he was going to crush
Rebecca
just to receive cheers from the audience who despised her.
However, he does have some sense of honor, as he chose to risk his own life in order to protect
Monkey D. Luffy
from
Donquixote Doflamingo
and give Luffy time to regain his strength and defeat the
Warlord of the Sea
.

History
[
]
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Rolling Logan entered the
Corrida Colosseum
to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
. For the battle royale, he was placed in D Block.
As the battle royale began,
Rolling Logan took out two gladiators with a vicious bear hug before turning to
Rebecca
and asking if he should break her bones next.
As he chased her around the arena, he mowed down all the gladiators who were also going after her.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Logan chased Rebecca and eventually caught her. While tormenting her by crushing her body,
Acilia
rescued Rebecca. Logan fought Acilia, eventually sending her flying backward. Rebecca then jumped into the air and tricked Logan into thinking she was attacking him. She used her sword to somersault over him and made him lose his balance, stumble forward and fall out of the ring.
Concludes non-canon section.
Acilia
helped defend Rebecca from the pursuing gladiators.
When 20 fighters remained,
Cavendish
's alter-ego Hakuba suddenly surfaced and proceeded to strike down all the remaining fighters in D Block. Rolling Logan fell victim to his attack and laid defeated on the arena.
Logan was later
transformed
into a
toy
and forced to work in the underground trade port. When
Sugar
's curse was broken, the toys returned to their original forms. Logan was among the former slaves praising
Usopp
for freeing them.
After
Doflamingo
initiated his
Birdcage
and was nearly defeated by
Monkey D. Luffy
, Rolling Logan and the other gladiators from the colosseum provided their aid to Luffy after he became exhausted.
Although the fighters were no match for the Warlord,
they did, however, buy enough time for Luffy to recover,
enabling him to defeat Doflamingo and bring down the Birdcage.
