He is of medium height and normal weight. He wears a shirt that's orange in the middle and white on the sides with light yellow buttons, along with orange shorts. He has hairy legs, and black boots with white laces. Overall, Kuromarimo resembles a boxer.
Personality
[
]
Kuromarimo is selfish and arrogant. He carried out every order Wapol gave him, including capturing the doctors from all over the kingdom. He thought that conscience did not serve the politics of his own kingdom and for this reason, he laughed at hearing Dalton talk about his meeting with Vivi.
Despite this, he is extremely loyal to Wapol and worried about him, like when Luffy threw him into the sea.
He is a great lover of alcohol, and often encouraged Dalton when both were still officials to have a drink with him instead of addressing problems within the kingdom.
Kuromarimo was able to work very well with Chess, since both shared similar characteristics and ideas. Compared to Chess, however, he proved more lenient towards Dalton after his rebellion. In fact, when he went to visit him in prison to persuade him to apologize to Wapol, he merely mistreated him a little.

Past
[

Kuromarimo became the magistrate after
Wapol
became king. He approved everything that Wapol did, including eliminating all of the doctors on
Drum Island
, except the
Isshi-20
.

Drum Island Arc
[
]
Kuromarimo and the rest of the
Bliking Pirates
crossed the path of the
Straw Hat Pirates
and begin to attack the pirates. But they stopped the attack after
Luffy
sent
Wapol
to the sea. Kuromarimo and the Bliking Pirates decided to rescue their king and swear vengeance on the Straw Hat Pirates.
One day later, Kuromarimo and the Bliking Pirates returned to Drum Island after one year of exile and began to terrorize the inhabitants of Drum Island. Kuromarimo also learned that the Straw Hat Pirates were also on Drum Island. After they defeated
Dalton
, Kuromarimo and the Bliking Pirates were buried by an avalanche caused by the
Lapahns
.
Thinking that the avalanche was caused by the Straw Hat Pirates, Wapol, Kuromarimo, and Chess decided to pursue the Straw Hat Pirates. Kuromarimo, Wapol, and Chess managed to find Luffy who was carrying Nami and Sanji to
Kureha
, who is living at Wapol's
former castle
. They tried to attack him but Luffy dodged the attack. They continued the attack until the Lapahns stopped Kuromarimo and Chess, giving Luffy time to escape. But soon after, Kuromarimo, Wapol and Chess defeated the Lapahns.
Kuromarimo, Wapol and Chess then go to Drum Castle with the help of Robson so Wapol can evict Kureha and
Chopper
from his castle. Once arrived, they confronted not only Kureha and Chopper, but also Luffy and
Sanji
.
When Luffy nearly sent Wapol off the cliff with a punch, Kuromarimo and Chess saved him just in time. Kuromarimo then send his afro-shaped hairballs at Sanji, which stick to him.
Wapol eats Chess and Kuromarimo to create Chessmarimo.
After being humiliated again by Luffy, Wapol then used his
Baku Baku no Mi
abilities to fuse Kuromarimo and Chess into
Chessmarimo
.
After transforming, Chessmarimo vowed to protect Wapol, and then engaged a fight with Chopper. The reindeer ate a
Rumble Ball
, and much to Chessmarimo's surprise, he achieved more than his regular three transformations. After Chopper evaded their attacks with
Jump Point
, blocked them with
Guard Point
, and destroyed their hammers with
Arm Point
, he used his
Brain Point
to locate Chessmarimo's weak spot. After his chin was identified as the weak point, Chessmarimo was defeated by Chopper's
Kokutei Roseo
.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]

marimo
" is a kind of algae that forms into round balls due to the action of the tides. So in essence, "Kuromarimo" is a way of referring to his hairstyle.
In the
4Kids
dub, Kuromarimo speaks with an American Southern accent. In the
Funimation
dub, he speaks with an ebonic accent.
