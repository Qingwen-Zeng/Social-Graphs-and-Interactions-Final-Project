pursued the
Straw Hat Pirates
after the chaos at the wedding ceremony, Mascarpone and Joscarpone were inside the
Mirro-World
. They showed
Brûlée
a mirror leading to a bathroom on the
Thousand Sunny
. They narrowly dodged a punch from Luffy and laughed at him when
Katakuri
pinned him down. Mascarpone and Joscarpone then tried to burn the Sunny by firing flame arrows through the mirror.
They were later told by
Perospero
that Big Mom sunk the Thousand Sunny. However, Mascarpone and Joscarpone noticed by looking through the mirror that the ship did not appear to be underwater. They were then puzzled when the mirrors leading to the ship began breaking one after another.
