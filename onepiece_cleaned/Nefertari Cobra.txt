Nefertari Cobra
was the 12th
king
of the
Arabasta Kingdom
,
the former patriarch of
Nefertari Family
, husband of the late
Nefertari Titi
and father of
Nefertari Vivi
. He was related to
Nefertari D. Lili
, one of the
First Twenty
monarchs who founded the
World Government
, and secretly bore her initial
D.
in his name.
He was a major character throughout the
Arabasta Arc
and a two-time participant of the
Levely
, having played a key role in the vote that led to the dissolution of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
in the latest one. During the latest Levely, Cobra was murdered by
Imu
and the
Five Elders
after learning about the former's existence and sacrificing himself so
Sabo
could escape.
Appearance
[
]
Cobra was a man of average height. He had a wrinkled face, a tied-off beard, and long, curly, black hair. He wore a green robe with yellow edging, an orange and beige sash around his waist, and a purple coat. He also wore black shoes and a necklace.
After the timeskip he grew a mustache, his beard had turned completely gray, and only half of his hair was still dark. His sideburns were gray but the upper half of the back and top were black. He wore a lighter colored robe and coat and no longer wore his necklace.
Personality
[
]
Cobra was a fair man, who cared for his kingdom and people even after their rebellion, knowing their misled coup was still only rooted in a desire to preserve the welfare of the Arabastan people. He was loyal to the line of Arabastan kings and the Dynasty, and was willing to face death to prevent
Crocodile
from seizing the throne. Yet, as a testament to his character, this loyalty to the monarchy is superseded by the compassion toward his subjects and he placed their survival and welfare ahead of his own, even willing to allow the occupation and possible destruction of his capital city if it meant preventing the bloodshed of his people, seeing the lives of his citizens as the true heart of his kingdom.
Overall, he was objective, able to look ahead to the future and not make impulsive decisions. This was shown clearly when
Koza
demands that he use
Dance Powder
to assuage the difficulties of the current drought, and Cobra explained that other countries need rain and hoarding it themselves is not a true solution.
Cobra also appeared to have a mischievous side, telling the Straw Hats where the women's baths were so they could peep at
Nami
and his daughter. Still he remained humble, and he even bowed before the Straw Hats in the bathhouse for helping his daughter, justifying it by saying that without his clothes, he did not have his status as a king, and was doing it as a father.
Cobra tried to raise his daughter humbly and somewhat as a normal child, as he was not overly upset when Koza got into a physical fight with Vivi, as well as letting Vivi simply refer to him as "dad". He let Vivi have a lot of freedom as a child and play with commoner children. However, he still worried a lot about her and often sneaked after her to check if she was doing okay. Like most fathers, he also wanted what he thinks is best for his daughter and tried to persuade Vivi into finding a
husband
before he passed away from his illness, but Cobra's words fell on deaf ears as Vivi told him to send the suitors away, still wishing to remain a free spirit like the Straw Hats. Vivi also berated her father on using his illness as an excuse for her to marry.
In addition, he was charitable, paying to support the citizens of Koza's village out of the royal family's living expenses without hesitation. Like most of the bearers of the
Will of D.
, Cobra wasn’t afraid of death and was ready to accept it when he knew it was unavoidable. At the same time, Cobra wanted to make sure his last action wasn't for nothing, as he sacrificed himself to let Sabo escape so he can pass a message on to Luffy and Vivi.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the
king
of Arabasta, a member of the
World Government
, Cobra had full authority over his subjects and was allowed to attend the
Levely
.
In addition to his royal authority over all of Arabasta's troops, Cobra was a reasonably athletic man in his youth, enough to help
Igaram
fight members of
Agotogi
's gang hand-to-hand.
Though apparently lacking any formal combat training, he even exercised a "technique" known as the
King Chop
(
キングチョップ
,
Kingu Choppu
?
)
on subjects who annoyed him, up to and including his own ministers.
By the time of
Operation Utopia
, he had become infirm enough to be easily manhandled by
Mr. 4
and
Miss Merry Christmas
(as well as
Miss All-Sunday
). At the same time, he still possessed enough stamina to survive being crucified through the elbows for several hours.
Some time after the Straw Hat Pirates left Arabasta, he became severely ill, and confined to a wheelchair. By the time of the first post-
Summit War of Marineford
Levely
, his mortality became a matter of open question.
History

Past
[

Golden Age of Pirates
[
]
Cobra with his wife and Igaram reading about the Golden Age of Pirates.
After the infamous execution of the
Pirate King
Gol D. Roger
at
Loguetown
, Cobra read over a newspaper of the events and gravely announced that a terrible age has begun.
Igaram
and
Titi
were with him.
Six years later, Cobra and Titi would have a daughter they named
Vivi
.
Abduction Attempt on Vivi
[
]
Several years later, Cobra responded to a drought that struck
Koza
's village. He was unable to send rain, but was able to allow the citizens to reside in
Alubarna
. Around this time, Vivi befriended Koza, and during a kidnapping attempt made on Vivi,
Cobra defeated the last remaining kidnapper before
Chaka
and
Pell
could arrive. He had Koza treated for the injury over his eye, and asked if he loved the country, to which Koza replied that he did. Igaram, hearing that Vivi was more concerned about the possibility of her new friends sacrificing themselves for her than what might happen to her, was concerned that Vivi was too kind-hearted for a ruler, but Cobra insisted the situation was fine.
To thank Koza for defending Vivi, Cobra allowed
Toto
to set up a village in
Yuba
.
Levely
[
]
Cobra scolds Wapol for his selfish behavior at the Levely in Mary Geoise.
Six years before the start of the story, Cobra was at a
Levely
to discuss
Monkey D. Dragon
's threat to the stability of the world. When
Wapol
brushed it off, saying that it did not concern him, Cobra berated him for his irresponsible attitude. Wapol attempted to provoke a war by hitting Vivi, but the plan failed when Vivi, knowing the situation's implications, did not get upset as he had hoped.
Baroque Works' False Accusation
[
]
Three years later, a drought spread throughout the kingdom, and due to
Baroque Works
' schemes,
Arabasta
's citizens began to believe that Cobra had hoarded Dance Powder in Alubarna. About a year after the start of the drought, Koza confronted the king and begged him to use Dance Powder to save Yuba, but Cobra refused, stating that other towns needed their help. Koza then vowed to take back the rain by force.
At some point around this time, Vivi left with Igaram to infiltrate Baroque Works, which, unbeknownst to Cobra and the rest of Arabasta, were manipulating the situation to start a rebellion.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
Cobra expressed his gratitude for
Crocodile
defeating some pirates that tried to raid
Nanohana
, not knowing of Crocodile's true nature.
Soon afterwards, Vivi sent a letter to him, revealing the truth about the rebellion.
Cobra made the decision to send Pell to
Erumalu
and Chaka to set up the
Royal Army
in order to protect it from Baroque Works and
Rebel Army
.
However, Cobra was soon kidnapped by
Mr. 4
and
Miss Merry Christmas
,
and
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
went to Nanohana disguised as him, falsely confessing to using Dance Powder and ordering the town destroyed in order to incite the rebellion to attack.
Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas returned him to Alubarna and left him bound near the Eastern Gate.
When Crocodile arrived at the palace, he pinned Cobra to a wall and demanded to know the location of Pluton.
Cobra admitted to having no knowledge of it, so Crocodile asked about the location of the
Poneglyph
. Cobra agreed to lead him there.
Crocodile then had Cobra lead
Miss All Sunday
to the Arabasta Poneglyph to gather information about
Pluton
as the Warlord confronted Luffy at the Alubarna Palace.
Once inside the
Tomb of the Kings
, Cobra allowed Miss All Sunday into the Poneglyph chamber so she could read it. After Crocodile's arrival, Cobra displayed visible surprise when she deciphered the Poneglyph's message as mere historical records of Arabasta instead of Pluton's location, seemingly aware that Miss All Sunday was lying to her boss. As Crocodile and Miss All Sunday attempted to kill each other, Cobra took the opportunity to remove one of the columns in the tomb,  destabilizing it.
When Luffy arrived there and fought against Crocodile one last time, Cobra witnessed the battle, and was amazed by Luffy's finishing attack that punched Crocodile through bedrock. After the battle, Robin handed him the antidote to Crocodile's venom, which he gave to Luffy, telling her that he knew that contrary to what she had told Crocodile, the Poneglyph truly revealed the location of the weapon. He was surprised to hear about the "True History" that Robin had been searching for. Luffy then stood up and managed to carry him and Robin out of the tomb, but lost consciousness shortly after escaping, requiring Cobra to carry him the rest of the way. Cobra's innocence is proven when
Kappa
, having regained consciousness and the ability to speak, reveals that the King seen in Nanohana was an impostor. After Koza said that what he and the rebels had done was unforgivable, Cobra replied that the nation had lost much but gained nothing from the conflict, and now had to move forward and unite.
Cobra allowed the Straw Hats to stay at the palace while they recovered from their injuries, and had a great feast to celebrate their victory. Cobra had intended for it to be a quiet feast, but knew that with the Straw Hats, it would turn into a party. They then went to the palace baths and Cobra showed Sanji where Vivi and
Nami
were bathing. While peaking, he and the others were overwhelmed by Nami's "Happiness Punch". Cobra then thanked the Straw Hats for helping Vivi, as her father rather than as a king.
The next morning, Cobra tries to peek in on Vivi dressing, but
Terracotta
repels him, giving him a lump on the head in the process. After Vivi is dressed, Cobra notes that his daughter looks like her mother, and Vivi tells him and Igaram that she has something important to tell them (possibly related to her plan to bid the Straw Hats goodbye), calling him "Father" instead of "Papa". After Vivi's speech, in which Igaram serves as a stand-in, Cobra regretfully notes that it is hard for a father to no longer be called "Papa" by his daughter.
Water 7 Saga

After the events of Enies Lobby, Cobra was surprised to see Nico Robin as a member of the Straw Hat crew, noting that she is "unpredictable," and to see Vivi not surprised by the revelation.

Post-War Arc
[

Weeks after the events of the Whitebeard War, Cobra was informed by Chaka and Pell that a group of pirates have been driven out of the country without much damage. Cobra then wished that all the pirates in the world could be like the Straw Hats. He also read a newspaper article concerning Luffy.

Zou Arc
[

Cobra departed from Arabasta with his daughter, Chaka, Pell, and Karoo and journeyed to
Mary Geoise
for the upcoming Levely. Despite being in poor health, Cobra intended to ask the World Government about the Poneglyphs ever since meeting Nico Robin. While conversing with Vivi, he attempted to take advantage of his illness to convince his daughter to find herself a suitor, but Vivi saw through him and turned him down.
Levely Arc
[
]
The Arabasta Kingdom participants later arrived at
Mary Geoise
. Just prior to the Levely, Cobra received a letter from
Fujitora
and had a meeting with the admiral and
Riku Doldo III
. Cobra also requested an audience with the Five Elders as well. Cobra later went to the conference room with the other kings and queens to begin the Levely.
Wano Country Saga
[

Wano Country Arc
[
]
Cobra and Doldo both propose the abolishment of the Seven Warlords.
During the Levely, Cobra and Doldo were able to convince the other royals to vote for abolishing the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
system.
Cobra later made his way towards his audience with the Five Elders, although he was requested to meet them alone, approving of the condition.
Cobra met the Five Elders in front of the
Empty Throne
, recounted how the World Government came to happen 800 years ago and the importance of the Empty Throne, questioned the Five Elders about his ancestor,
Nefertari Lili
and one of the
First Twenty
, and what became of her after she refused to become a
World Noble
and settle in
Mary Geoise
, having supposedly never arrived at Alabasta and been missing since.
Cobra confronted by Imu during his audience with the Five Elders.
However, the Five Elders stated they could not tell him what happened to her, only stating information about her was lost to history. Being dissatisfied with this explanation, Cobra then asked them about the meaning of the
D.
, stating that a letter written by Lili containing information about the D., had been passed down from generation ever since, gaining the Five Elders' anger and disapproval over such an inquiry. Later, while still his having his audience,
Imu
, who overheard the conversation from their room, made their way to the throne, openly sitting on it in front of the Five Elders and Cobra, shocking the latter.
Imu tells Cobra that D. is the name of the World Government's enemy, and that Lili was responsible for unleashing the Poneglyphs onto the world, the truth of which exists in her letter. They ask Cobra for Lili's full name, and Cobra, realizing he wasn't going to leave the room alive, confesses her name is "Nefertari D. Lili".
Cobra sacrificing himself.
Imu transforms into some kind of creature and stabs Cobra with an arrow-like appendage just as
Sabo
, who was eavesdropping, comes to his aid. As Sabo is heavily injured from the attack, Cobra sacrificed himself to allow Sabo to escape and asks him to tell Luffy and Vivi that the entire Nefertari Family bears the name D. He then recites the words of the letter before finally meeting his end at Imu's hands. Sabo's sudden arrival was captured by a Den Den Mushi, which is why Sabo became the prime suspect behind his murder.
Legacy
[
]
Cobra's funeral.
Cobra's death, despite his reputation as a wise and just ruler, raised the spirits of rebellious people across the world who saw everyone affiliated with the
World Government
as an enemy. This eventually resulted in the
Eight-Nation Revolution
, and the
Revolutionary Army
chose to capitalize on this despite Sabo's innocence
who denied the allegation.
The Straw Hat Pirates (the ones who met with him before) were distraught and upset with his death, such as
Chopper
and
Usopp
who proclaimed him to be a kind and great king.
Cobra's body was entombed within the rebuilt Tomb of the Kings.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
For unknown reasons, his name was changed to
Nebra
in the
4Kids dubbed anime
(although the name "Cobra" still remained in some bits of closed captioning during broadcasts). Some fans have speculated that this occurred because contemporary 4Kids property
G.I. Joe: Sigma 6
featured a villainous terrorist organization named
Cobra
.
In the
VIZ
manga and
Funimation
's dub of the
eighth movie
, his name remains Cobra, but like Vivi, his family name is spelled
Nefeltari
.
