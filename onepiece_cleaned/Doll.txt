Personality
[

Doll is seemingly not an empathetic person, asking
Tashigi
to quiet down
Helmeppo
after his friend
Koby
had been kidnapped.
Doll was also annoyed at Garp for borrowing Navy manpower in an operation to rescue Koby from the
Blackbeard Pirates
without clearance.
Doll however does appear to have a soft spot for children, as she agreed with
Vegapunk
's request to attach balloons to the
Marine Headquarters G-14 Branch
to make the Punk Hazard children feel more at ease.
She also has some concern about the safety of her superiors, as she questioned
Saturn
and
Kizaru
's decision to stay behind on
Egghead
after it became the target of a
Buster Call
.
Unlike many others, she addresses Borsalino by his real name instead of by his epithet.
As a Marine, Doll strongly believes in
justice
.

History

Past
[
]
Over 20 years ago, Doll was a subordinate of Vice Admiral
Jaguar D. Saul
.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
While
Tashigi
was giving the children rescued from
Punk Hazard
their medicine, Doll approached her and asked her to calm
Helmeppo
down, as he was distraught about his kidnapped friend
Koby
.
Doll fights a Pacifista.
After
CP0
had invaded
Egghead
and begun fighting the
Emperor
Monkey D. Luffy
, the
Marines
were called to back up CP0. Before the G-14 Marines could leave,
Monkey D. Garp
had called Doll and told her about his intentions to take Helmeppo and rescue Koby from the
Blackbeard Pirates
. She tried to dissuade him from taking her subordinate and instigating a fight with another
Emperor
, but he ignored her protests and surprised her by stating he had already arrived at the Marine base.
Doll was then part of the Marine fleet sent to Egghead, led by
Jaygarcia Saturn
,
Kizaru
, and eight other Vice Admirals.
When the Pacifista were later ordered to attack the Marines by
Sentomaru
, Doll engaged some in combat.
Shortly after, she and
Urban
felt the presence of
Jaygarcia Saturn
arriving on the island.
Sometime later, a
Buster Call
was activated with Egghead as the target. As a result, all Marines were ordered to evacuate the island. Saturn and Kizaru had elected to remain on the island. Doll attempted to question Kizaru on his decision, but was simply told to leave in response.
Due to the arrival of the
Giant Warrior Pirates
, Doll and
Bluegrass
hopped on a
Sea Beast Weapon
to confront them, She revealed to Bluegrass that she used to be a subordinate under a
Vice Admiral giant
more than 20 years ago.
Before they could arrive at their destination, they witnessed the remaining
Five Elders
arrive on Egghead.
Eventually, the two made it back to the island, and moved in to confront the Giants, who were attempting to make their escape with Luffy and his allies. Bluegrass used the Sea Beast Weapon she was riding to shoot a laser into the Giant's ship, with Doll following close behind. Doll used her Haki to attack
Kashii
, quickly defeating him.
Despite their attempts, she and Bluegrass would both be easily dispatched by Bonney via being de-aged to children. As a result, Doll herself expressed great anger toward Bonney.
Later, Doll was angry because Luffy punched
Ju Peter
.
When
Emet
unleashed a powerful concentration of
Supreme King Haki
that
Joy Boy
had locked inside its body, Doll remained unaffected but commented on the power of the Haki.
Doll was eventually overwhelmed by the Haki and rendered unconscious along with the other Marines.
Some time later, Doll, now back to her normal age, apologized along with the other Vice-Admirals present on Egghead to Jaygarcia Saturn, for their failure to apprehend the Straw Hat Pirates and Bonney. They then reacted with shock and horror as they witnessed Saturn withering into a skeleton.
