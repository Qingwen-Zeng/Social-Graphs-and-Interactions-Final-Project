Ishigo inspecting the gold that the Straw Hats brought to him.
When
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Nami
, and
Usopp
brought him their
Skypiean
gold to exchange for cash, he quickly grew excited at its sheer quality, but deliberately undervalued it at
100,000,000. Though Luffy and Usopp were easily satisfied, Nami was suspicious of the appraisal, and warned Ishigo of Luffy's
bounty
before threatening violence. Ishigo was instantly intimidated and exchanged their gold for its rightful cash value:
300,000,000.
