Lieutenant Commander Helmeppo
is a
Marine officer
and the son of ex-Marine Captain
"Axe-Hand" Morgan
. Once a civilian who shamelessly exploited his father's status, he (together with
Koby
) underwent extensive training under
Vice Admiral
Garp
to become a full-fledged serviceman, currently holding the rank of
lieutenant commander
.
He is also a member of the secret group known as
SWORD
.
Due to his actions during his initial appearance, he can be considered a supporting antagonist of the
Romance Dawn Arc
. He and
Koby
are also the protagonists of
Diary of Koby-Meppo
Cover Page Serial.
Appearance
[
]
Helmeppo is a lanky, average-sized young man with a distinctive cleft chin and light blonde hair.
Originally, he wore his hair in a bizarre mushroom-shaped style, coupled with flashy leisure suits (and what appeared to be a rubber-band ring on his left hand). After his
father
was ousted from power, he was "demoted" to a standard Marine chore-boy uniform.
Under the training of
Vice Admiral
Garp
, he became notably taller and more muscular. By the time he progressed to
Chief Petty Officer
, he started to wear his hair in a broad ponytail, coupled with a white shirt, pale green vest over it, purple slacks, black gloves, and a rather odd-looking black visor over his eyes.
At his current rank of
Lieutenant Commander
, he has donned a brimmed white hat and junior Marine officer's overcoat. Unlike most other Marines of similar rank, he wears this coat conventionally (
i.e.
with arms in the sleeves).
Personality
[
]
During his
father
's rule over the
153rd Branch
and
Shells Town
, Helmeppo was a spoiled and obnoxious man, constantly exploiting anyone he could with threats of arrest and execution.
Whenever his status failed to protect him, he would inevitably collapse into total cowardice. Even at his worst, however, he was notably sentimental, showing small mercies unknown to Morgan.
He lost his luxurious life that he had under his father's rank after his father was kicked out. He was forced to become a chore boy alongside Koby, whose friendly approaches were turned down. Part of Helmeppo was still loyal to his father which was evident when he cried before his father's execution. However, he later realizes that his father is as brutal and murderous as the pirates, causing Helmeppo to oppose and disown him. This finally cut his last tie to his father and pushed him to change, becoming braver and less of a spoiled brat. Eventually, he and Koby become good friends.
Helmeppo matures by the events of Water 7, even referring to his younger self as "that bratty, selfish son who lived off his father's status". Now a lieutenant commander alongside Koby, he continues his training in the Marines. He was deeply (and comically) upset when Zoro and Luffy did not recognize him.
Helmeppo seems to be more levelheaded than Koby when it comes down to analyzing situations, as Koby is more aggressive. After the time skip, he has developed a penchant for being overly formal, even with Koby.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Morgan
[
]
Helmeppo previously thought that he had a very good relationship with his father
Morgan
. Before meeting
Monkey D. Luffy
and Koby, Helmeppo took advantage of his father's position as a tyrannical Marine Captain to act as he pleased, believing his father would back him up should anything threaten or displease him. To his shock, however, when Helmeppo tried to call for his father to get back at Luffy for punching him, Morgan instead smashed his son with the back of his ax-hand for trying to order him around, revealing that he had no fatherly affection for him and even considered Helmeppo a worthless son not worth hitting. Despite this, Helmeppo remained delusional of his relationship with his father and tried to assist him in defeating Luffy by taking Koby hostage. After Morgan was stripped of his rank and incarcerated, he escaped and took his son hostage, at which point Helmeppo finally disowned his father and changed his personality.
Marines
[
]
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
Garp
is the mentor of Helmeppo and Koby. He keeps them out of trouble and ensures that they are not slacking off. If they do get out of hand, he knocks them around to ensure they know their place.
After Koby was captured by the Blackbeard Pirates, Garp sailed to G-14 to pick up Helmeppo so they could go on the rescue mission together, for which Helmeppo was immensely grateful.
Koby
[
]
Helmeppo first "met" Koby by holding him at gunpoint, in a desperate (and unsuccessful) ploy to stall Luffy. Despite this, Koby remained good-natured toward Helmeppo after Morgan's defeat sent Helmeppo into the same chore-boy station as Koby himself.
He was forced to become a chore boy alongside
Koby
, and despite Koby's good-natured attempts to befriend him, he refused any of it. After being kidnapped by his own father and held hostage, Helmeppo disowned his father and started changing, becoming braver and less of a spoiled brat. Eventually, Koby and Helmeppo become good friends. Now they are working together. In addition, Helmeppo seems to care for Koby, and he rushed to help him after being defeated by Luffy. When Koby was kidnapped by
Marshall D. Teach
, Helmeppo was very emotionally shaken and tearful, going as far as to suggest that SWORD needed to dispatch the
Seraphim
to rescue him.
Other
[
]
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Initially, Helmeppo feared both
Roronoa Zoro
and
Monkey D. Luffy
for defying his status, crossing into outright resentment after they toppled Morgan - and by extension himself - from power. Over time, however, he came to recognize them as vital to his maturation, and tried to reconcile with them during their brief reunion at
Water 7
(though the Straw Hats, to his annoyance, largely dismissed him while marveling at Koby's development).
Soro
[
]
Helmeppo was fond of his pet wolf
Soro
, allowing it to freely roam
Shells Town
- and swiftly having Zoro arrested for killing the creature. However, he does not appear to have grieved much over the death itself, never directly mentioning it in any of his (witnessed) interactions with Zoro.
Rika
[
]
Like most of
Shells Town
,
Rika
abhorred Helmeppo during Morgan's reign, even cheering Luffy for punching him.
In turn, Helmeppo had no compunctions about verbally or physically bullying her, though he was notably disturbed by the idea of killing her.
After Morgan's downfall, Rika apparently warmed to the newly-disgraced Helmeppo, due in part to
Koby
's budding friendship with him. When the two chore-boys were permanently transferred to
Marine Headquarters
, Rika was upset to the point of tears.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a Marine lieutenant commander, Helmeppo has power over lower-ranked subordinates. He is also part of the Marine squadron SWORD, meaning he has the freedom to disregard orders from his superiors and move and act as he pleases.
Physical Abilities
[
]
In the beginning, Helmeppo was a typical weakling who relied on his father's status to get whatever he wanted. But after a harsh training regimen under Garp, Helmeppo gained great physical prowess. He was able to jump very high while intercepting Zoro.
After the two year timeskip, he became powerful enough to become a lieutenant commander, and overpower an entire pirate crew by himself with great ease. Helmeppo has shown incredible speed matching Koby and Grus when using Soru. He also has incredible durability to survived being hit by a cannonball point blank unscathed and rescued Koby after the latter destroyed Pizarro's island hand.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Helmeppo is considerably skilled in swordsmanship. He was able to force Zoro on the defensive for a few seconds before ultimately losing. After the timeskip, his swordsmanship prowess has greatly increased, able to cause considerable damage to a pirate submarine while underwater. He is also able to hit a cannonball flying overhead at a great speed, although he ended up caught in the resulting explosion.
Weapons
[
]
As a civilian, Helmeppo showed some interest in collecting weapons (including Zoro's
Meito
), but no desire or ability to use any of them apart from a single
pistol
.
As a full-fledged Marine, Helmeppo's weapons of choice are a pair of
kukri
, which he keeps at the back of his waist on his belt. He was seen using them against Zoro when they met again in
Water 7
.
However, he was still no match for Zoro.
After the timeskip, Helmeppo wields a larger pair of kukri.
Helmeppo's dual kukri.
Helmeppo's new kukri.
Rokushiki
[
]
After the timeskip, he is seemingly capable of using
Soru
like
Koby
.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Helmeppo is able to use
Armament Haki
.
It is unclear whether or not he possesess
Observation Haki
. On one hand, he commented on how impressive
Koby
's Observation Haki was, in that Koby was able to sense an underwater attack on the ships of the
Prodence
and
Dressrosa
Kingdoms when he could not.
This could be intepreted as Helmeppo possessing Observation Haki, albeit weaker than Koby's. However,
Vivre Card - One Piece Visual Dictionary
does not list Observation Haki for him at all.
History
[
]
East Blue Saga
[
]
Romance Dawn Arc
[
]
As son of the
153rd Branch
's
Captain
Morgan
, Helmeppo led a carefree, luxurious life, constantly using his father's authority to command lesser
Marines
and bully the citizens of surrounding
Shells Town
. One particular day, he let his pet wolf
Soro
roam the town, only for traveling bounty hunter
Roronoa Zoro
to kill it for attacking a young girl named
Rika
. Furious, Helmeppo had Zoro arrested and his swords confiscated, but promised a full pardon if Zoro could survive a month detained without food.
However, after nine days of starvation failed to break Zoro, Helmeppo (with his father's tacit approval) decided to execute the bounty hunter as a warning to the townsfolk. Around the same time, reports of the arrest led rookie pirate
Monkey D. Luffy
and aspiring Marine
Koby
to Shells Town, partly in hopes of recruiting Zoro. On seeing Helmeppo taunt Zoro, destroy the
onigiri
brought by a guilt-stricken Rika, order her physically tossed from the grounds,
and
publicly announce Zoro's impending execution, Luffy furiously punched him.
Helmeppo threatening to shoot Koby.
Shocked and humiliated, Helmeppo immediately fled to his father and demanded retribution; to his further shock, Morgan replied with a blow of his own, declared executing Rika the higher priority, and promptly cut down
a subordinate
for objecting. Shortly after, Luffy—now seeking to retrieve Zoro's swords—caught up and took Helmeppo captive.
Dragged along as both an unwitting guide and a human shield against pursuing Marines, Helmeppo quickly fainted.
Later, he woke to find Luffy, Koby, and Zoro openly defying the 153rd Branch, Luffy in particular easily outfighting Morgan. Desperate, Helmeppo tried to take Koby hostage with a pistol, but was punched unconscious by Luffy.
Diary of Koby-Meppo
[
]
After Morgan was arrested, Helmeppo was allowed to stay at the 153rd Branch, but as a chore-boy. Already indignant at losing so many luxuries and privileges, Helmeppo was furious at having to work alongside the willing recruit Koby, and spent much of his free time trying to curse Luffy with voodoo dolls, along with spending time with Rika who forgave him for his actions.
Morgan takes his own son as a hostage.
The two were later tasked with chore duty on a ship transferring the prisoner Morgan. As they cleaned the ship's weapons, Helmeppo was worried about his father possibly getting the death penalty. As Vice Admiral
Garp
was taking Morgan into his custody, Koby had to restrain Helmeppo. However, Morgan caught Garp off-guard and slashed him before taking Helmeppo hostage in the process. Morgan then escaped with Helmeppo on a small boat.
On Morgan's escape vessel, Helmeppo finally made a decision and abandoned his father. Helmeppo swam back to the Marine ship, where he, Koby, and the other Marines apologized to Garp for the ruckus and called themselves worthless. Garp decided to take Helmeppo and Koby back with him to
Marine Headquarters
to train them.
Initially working as chore boys, both Helmeppo and Koby underwent harsh training and were taught swordsmanship by
Bogard
under Garp's supervision.
At some point, Garp lectured Helmeppo and other recruits about the Marines' priorities.
During training, Garp asked Helmeppo about Koby's bandaged hands, and Helmeppo revealed that Koby had been doing his own additional training in private, punching battleship bags every night.

Zoro and Luffy defeat Helmeppo and Koby.
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
returned from their raid on
Enies Lobby
, Helmeppo and Koby confronted Zoro and Luffy respectively at
Water 7
, but both Marines were easily defeated. While Luffy and Zoro remembered Koby, they had no idea who Helmeppo was until he reminded them and they briefly recalled him as the annoying spoiled brat, much to Helmeppo's dismay. Helmeppo was later shocked to hear from Garp that Revolutionary
Monkey D. Dragon
was his son and Luffy's father. He questioned how crazy the family was with so many infamous people in it.
When Garp returned to his ship, Helmeppo and Koby stayed behind and reminisced with Luffy. Afterwards, Luffy invited them in to eat, but they refused as Marines and pirates cannot be too friendly. Before leaving, they promised to meet Luffy again in the New World and to get stronger in the meantime.
The Marines later chased the Straw Hats as they sailed from Water 7. Helmeppo tried in vain to calm Garp after Luffy taunted the vice-admiral. After the
Thousand Sunny
escaped, Helmeppo had to held Koby back from cheering too much.

Marineford Arc
[

Helmeppo and Koby at Marineford.
Along with
Monkey D. Garp
and
Koby
, Helmeppo reported to Marine Headquarters to participate in the war against the
Whitebeard Pirates
. Three hours before
Ace
's execution, Helmeppo and Koby listened to
Sengoku
's speech about Ace's past and, after hearing that Ace was
Gol D. Roger
's son, concluded that Ace and Luffy were not real brothers.
Helmeppo ran away from the battle along with Koby and witnessed
Akainu
's wrath on a Marine who did the same. He and Koby then saw Luffy and company fall from the sky.
Luffy's unconventional arrival at Marineford left both Helmeppo and Koby stunned.
When Sengoku announced that Luffy is Dragon's son, Helmeppo and Koby were shocked to see that the Fleet Admiral decided to reveal such information.
Helmeppo tried to help Koby get back on his feet after Koby collapsed from hearing voices in his head disappearing. Helmeppo then panicked when Koby stood in Admiral Akainu's way and demanded that the fighting stop, but
Shanks
arrived in time to stop Akainu from killing Koby, who lost consciousness.

Helmeppo listens as Dr. Fishbonen explains that Koby's Haki has awakened.
Koby was taken to the Marine Headquarters medical center along with other injured soldiers, and Helmeppo stayed at his bedside. Koby was still clearly traumatized by the events.
Doctor Fishbonen
told them that what Koby was feeling was
Haki
. Doctor Fishbonen informed Koby that all Vice Admirals are able to use Haki, and that Garp should be able to help him. Helmeppo expressed envy that Koby seemed to have advanced in skill, though Koby claimed to not have known about the ability in the first place.

Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
After Koby was kidnapped by
Marshall D. Teach
, Helmeppo traveled to
G-14
in the
New World
. There, he and
Hibari
begged Marine HQ Rear Admiral and fellow
SWORD
member
Prince Grus
to go with them to
Hachinosu
to rescue Koby.
Garp
later arrived at G-14 and called for Helmeppo. He told Garp that Koby had been kidnapped and how powerless he felt that he could not stop it, but Garp just told him to get on board as he planned on launching an attack on Hachinosu to rescue him.
Helmeppo with SWORD led by Garp on Hachinosu
Helmeppo would later then sail to Hachinosu alongside Garp and selected Marine, including
Tashigi
, to free Koby from the
Blackbeard Pirates
. Arriving at Hachinosu on a battleship in the air, he watched Garp launch an a fist attack on the island,
and later set foot onto the island when Garp landed, alongside the other Marines. Helmeppo was then tearfully overjoyed to see that Koby was fine, but later horrified when Hibari was frozen and
Kuzan
appeared, revealing himself to be a captain of the Blackbeard Pirates and effectively their enemy, then observing Garp and Kuzan fighting one versus one.
Just as the battle intensified, Helmeppo saw himself surrounded by Blackbeard Pirates, alongside Garp, Koby and Prince Grus. He watched in horror when
Shiryu
stabbed Garp, who protected Koby just when Koby fell for a trap and then later Garp and Kuzan once again trading blows, this time with Garp ending on the floor, severely beaten. Helmeppo then watched
Avalo Pizarro
using
his Devil Fruit
to prepare to crush the warship with several civilians outside.
However, he, Koby and Prince Grus later gained instructions and orders from Garp, who told them that they could save their allies if they worked together. Garp then ordered Helmeppo specifically to protect Koby and Prince Grus from any incoming enemy to ensure no one would interefere with Koby's or Prince Gru's saving attempts. Helmeppo then saw some pirates shooting cannon balls at Koby and Grus, using himself as a human shield to protect both. Later, as Koby had destroyed Pizarro's island hand, Helmeppo catched Koby and made it to the battleship safely alongside Koby, Grus and every slave on the island. However, Helmeppo then realized alongside the others that Garp was not on board the ship, having decided to stay behind, sacrificing himself to ensure they could get out safely. Helmeppo then tearfully accepted Garp's last order for them to sail away safely, as they were all deemed "The Future of the Marines" by Garp.
Helmeppo recovers alongside his allies.
Sometime later, the group would eventually make it to the
Marine GS General Hospital
for medical attention. During this, they would listen in to Vegapunk's broadcast to the world, with Helmeppo believing that the final part of the message was about the
One Piece
.

Adaptation Differences
[

Anime Differences
[
]
Due to the compressed narration of the
Diary of Koby-Meppo
cover arc, the anime creates several new scenes for Helmeppo, such as a flashback where he remembers his luxurious life while his father was a captain in the Marines, and a fight with Koby which accidentally activates a cannon and destroys part of the 153rd Branch. Also, after his kidnapping by his father, Helmeppo swears that one day he will become stronger than him and that one day he will capture Morgan.
Several further expansions are made for the couple's guardianship under Vice Admiral Garp, including a newspaper article claiming that they had taken the standard
Reverse Mountain
route to the
Grand Line
(a conflict with later revelations in the
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
, where it is mentioned that they crossed the
Calm Belt
).
During a scene before sleeping in his room, he is shown to make the decision to become a Marine officer so he can return to the life of comfort he had before, deciding to start training instead of sleeping. Also, his fitness in training is marked by an incident in which Garp incites them into a direct fight, under the pretext of punishing them for their "relationships" with Luffy.
Live-Action Differences
[
]
In the
live-action series
, Helmeppo has a more extended role throughout the events of the
East Blue
, being part of a subplot of Garp's crew on his Marine ship during said events.
While in the manga he has the incident with Zoro due to the problems caused by his pet
Soro
, and being chronologically later the moment in which he tramples
Rika
's rice balls, in the live-action series both events are merged, colliding with Rika in the bar and throwing the rice balls she was carrying, then trampling them and carrying out the conflict with Zoro.
In the manga, after being hit by Luffy, Helmeppo tells his father, who also ends up hitting his son while he was complaining about what happened to him. At the same moment, Luffy appears, who takes Helmeppo to find Zoro's swords, which Helmeppo kept in his room. In the live-action series, he is never hit by Luffy, and his father hits him due to his complaints about the conflict with Zoro in a scene where he brings the bounty hunter to his father. Also, instead of Luffy appearing to find Zoro's swords, it is Zoro himself who arrives on his own at Helmeppo's room, finding the latter playing with the
Wado Ichimonji
while he was naked, which leads Helmeppo to to cover himself with a teddy bear that looks similar to him.
Later, a moment is added in which Helmeppo tries to stop Luffy and his companions from leaving Shells Town, showing that Zoro cut his hair with his swords, but he is hit by Koby and falls unconscious.
Instead of meeting Garp when he visits a Marine ship that Helmeppo was traveling on, Garp himself appears in the 153rd Branch, subsequently taking Helmeppo on his ship.
Throughout their journey through the East Blue, Helmeppo and Koby's relationship as companions is explored, with both sharing their different views on Garp's actions, and on the Marines and the World Government in general.
Among Helmeppo's extra actions in the live-action series is that he and Koby, along with other Marines, visit the
Syrup Village
and encounter
Usopp
, who tries to warn them about
Kuro
and his identity as a pirate, but after speaking with the latter, he denies Usopp's accusations and gives them an unconscious Luffy, who is later rescued by Zoro.
Also while they are on Garp's ship, Helmeppo explains to Koby about the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, just as
Yosaku
did in the manga with Luffy and
Sanji
.
Garp's crew also visits the
Baratie
looking for clues about Luffy, with Helmeppo and Koby getting information on his whereabouts from one of the employees.
After which, they visit the
Coco Village
, where after witnessing a fight between Garp and Luffy, back on Garp's ship Helmeppo expresses to the vice admiral his desire to be a better soldier for the Marines.
Translation and Dubbing Issues
[
]
Helmeppo's weapon in the 4Kids version of the anime.
In the
4Kids
-dubbed anime, the pistol that Helmeppo holds to Koby's head is digitally replaced with a bizarre device resembling a spring-loaded hammer. This edit is often mocked for its patchiness, as the "hammer" reverts to its original shape in several different shots.
