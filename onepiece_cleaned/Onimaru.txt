.
Onimaru
is a
komagitsune
who was once the companion of the late
daimyo
of
Ringo
,
Shimotsuki Ushimaru
.
After the death of his master, he joined forces with
Kawamatsu
in collecting weapons for the
final battle
against
Kaidou
and protecting them from robbers. After Kawamatsu was captured, Onimaru posed as a
human
known as
Gyukimaru on Oihagi Bridge
, stealing weapons from people while continuing to guard the graves.
Appearance
[
]
Being a komagitsune, Onimaru heavily resembles a fox, with his fur and tail having a flaming composition, and his pointy ears have a swirly appearance. His fur is light, with his legs being dark below the knees. He is rather large, appearing to be over half the size of the very large kappa Kawamatsu.
As Gyukimaru, he is a very large man with a face resembling a mask. He wears a dark kimono, light pants, and a light cape, and carries many weapons on his back. He also wears a very large bead necklace.
Personality
[
]
Onimaru is fiercely protective of the graves of those buried in Ringo, and has tirelessly worked to protect them for almost two decades, enduring multiple injuries in the process but never wavering.
Onimaru is very violent against those who try to violate the graves. It was only when Kawamatsu offered Onimaru his arm that the komagitsune let the
samurai
take the weapons from the graves.
As Gyukimaru, he was unwilling to believe
Roronoa Zoro
's claim that he had rightfully obtained
Shusui
from
Shimotsuki Ryuma
. He does not seem to take much interest in activities outside of guarding the graves and stealing weapons from passersby.
Onimaru has shown in his Gyukimaru transformation that he is very intelligent and aware of the legends and history of Wano. This is seen as he greatly reveres the legends of Ryuma, and so went to great lengths to return Shusui to his grave, as he left Ringo and went to Ebisu Town near the
Flower Capital
just to take it back. He is rather pragmatic in battle and always looks for an opening on his opponent, even when they are distracted or caught up by something else altogether.
However, he is merciful enough to not attack an opponent who can no longer fight.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Onimaru is a skilled thief, being able to successfully steal
Shusui
from
Zoro
and make his way halfway across
Wano Country
at a fast pace.
His jaw is quite strong, as he was able to instantly cause considerable injury to
Kawamatsu
's arm by biting it.
He also has considerable endurance, as he stood to protect the graves after being struck by arrows, and in the present day, he was able to withstand a bazooka shot from one of the
Beasts Pirates
.

Onimaru ate the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Onyudo, an
Mythical Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a full monk yokai and a komagitsune-monk hybrid at will. Onimaru is able to transform into a large humanoid, who is known as
Gyukimaru
. As Gyukimaru, he is capable of
human
speech.
Befitting his size, Gyukimaru has enormous strength as he could match Zoro's physical power. He also has great speed, able to match Zoro's agility, though in their next match, he was overwhelmed by Zoro, implying he might have had an advantage in the first match because he caught the swordsman off-guard.
Spearmanship
[
]
Gyukimaru has been shown to be extremely skilled in wielding his
naginata
, able to clash evenly with the powerful
swordsman
Roronoa Zoro
. He has been shown using the handle of the staff to counter Zoro's
sword
strikes.
Weapons
[
]
While acting as Gyukimaru, his main weapon is a very long naginata, which grants him great size and range in addition to cutting power.
He also carries around a very large variety of weapons on his back.
History
[

Past
[
]
Onimaru served as the companion of the
daimyo
of
Ringo
,
Shimotsuki Ushimaru
,
until around 18 years ago when Ushimaru was slain in rebellion against
Kurozumi Orochi
and Kaidou. For around five years, he remained around the region's main cemetery, protecting it from robbers even as Orochi and
Kaidou
turned Ringo into a wasteland.
Kawamatsu giving Onimaru aburaage.
13 years before the present day, Onimaru was chasing away some members of the
Beasts Pirates
when he encountered the
samurai
Kawamatsu
. He collapsed from receiving multiple wounds, and Kawamatsu nursed him back to health. After regaining his strength, Onimaru opposed Kawamatsu's effort to collect the weapons of the buried, feeling betrayed bit into his arm. Kawamatsu revealed that he wished to collect the weapons for a planned
final battle
against Orochi and Kaidou, but Onimaru did not budge. However, he relented when Kawamatsu offered him his arm, and licked away the blood from the wound he dealt. Onimaru then assisted Kawamatsu in collecting the weapons, and Kawamatsu aided him in protecting the graves from robbers, disguising himself as "Gyukimaru" when chasing them away.
Less than a year later, Kawamatsu was captured during a trip to the
Flower Capital
, leaving Onimaru alone again. As 13 years passed, Onimaru appeared to people as a
human
, donning Kawamatsu's alias of Gyukimaru. As Gyukimaru, he ambushed anyone who crossed Oihagi Bridge and stole their weapons, and stored all of them in an underground chamber.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Gyukimaru was in
Ebisu Town
when he spotted the
sword
Shusui
and took it.
He went to
Ringo
and returned it to
Shimotsuki Ryuma
's grave before he was confronted on Oihagi Bridge by
Roronoa Zoro
, from whom he had taken Shusui.
Refusing to believe Zoro rightfully earned the sword, Gyukimaru battled him to take his other two swords. A
woman
and a
girl
then came onto the scene being chased by
Kamazo
, and as Zoro turned his attention to Kamazo, Gyukimaru repeatedly tried striking at his openings, annoying the
swordsman
.
After Zoro defeated Kamazo, Gyukimaru took the
assassin
's
scythe
and walked away as Zoro fainted from the wound he received from the assassin.
Two days later, Gyukimaru was once again confronted by Zoro, who was determined to take back Shusui. Kawamatsu then came and interrupted the fight, and Gyukimaru was attacked by some
Beasts Pirates
who came seeking revenge on him for stealing their weapons. As Kawamatsu and Zoro fought the Beasts Pirates, Gyukimaru fled with tears of joy from learning that Kawamatsu was alive.
He ran to the main cemetery while being chased by Zoro, and opened up the entrance to the secret room where he stored all the weapons in. After watching Zoro lead Kawamatsu and Hiyori into the room, Gyukimaru transformed back into Onimaru.
He would later reunite with Kawamatsu in Ringo after the
Raid on Onigashima
where Kawamatsu,
Marco
and
Kin'emon
sat at a shrine dedicated to all fallen Oden's vassals,
daimyos
and Oden himself.
