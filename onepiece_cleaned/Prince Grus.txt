Prince Grus
is a
Marine Rear Admiral
stationed at
Marine base
G-14
and a member of
SWORD
.
His fellow SWORD members also refer to Grus by the title of
Prince
(
王子
,
Ōji
?
)
which differs from his surname.
Grus was first introduced during the
"Gang" Bege's Oh My Family
Cover Page Serial as a brief antagonist.
He made his proper debut in the main series during the
Egghead Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Grus is a muscular young man with fluffy, green shaggy hair and purple eyes. He wears a brown fur coat over an open red shirt that reveals his  torso. This red shirt consists of two vertical white lines on the left side and a golden chain around the collar. Grus sports red pants that are held together by a black belt with a golden buckle, and black laced shoes. His most noticeable trait is a Marine cap with an over-sized bill, which is the color red on the inside.
He also wears rings on each of the four fingers on his right hand.
During his debut in the cover story, he wore his fur coat draped over his shoulders.
In subsequent appearances in the Egghead Arc, he wears it normally with his arms through the sleeves.
Personality
[
]
Grus is a patient, reasonable individual who obeys the usual Marine protocols and avoids unnecessary recklessness, regardless if others attempt to pressure him into action.
However, he also seems to be envious of fellow colleagues if they have a higher reputation, as he couldn't believe that Koby was supposed to be the "Hero of the Navy" and vowed to sabotage him.
Relationships
[

Marines
[
]
X Drake
[
]
As captain of SWORD,
Drake
is Grus' superior, with the latter respecting the former's authority regarding decision-making of the unit. Having lost contact with Drake, Grus affirmed SWORD could not properly operate.
Helmeppo and Hibari
[
]
Both Helmeppo and Hibari appear to respect Grus' strength and authority, as they came pleading to him to do something about
Koby
's abduction, to which he refused to comply due to protocol reasons and common sense.
Koby
[
]
Grus has a one-sided rivalry with
Koby
, and is envious of Garp recognizing him as the "Future of the Marines". Despite this, he does trust him, as shown when he left
Avalo Pizarro
's
giant island hand
for Koby to destroy.
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
Grus greatly admires and looks up to Garp because of his reputation and sense of justice. He attempts to receive Garp's recognition, and like the other SWORD members, was unhappy about leaving him on
Hachinosu
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a Marine rear admiral, Grus has power over lower-ranking subordinates. He is also part of the Marine squadron SWORD, meaning he has the freedom to disregard orders from his superiors and move and act as he pleases.
Grus is a relatively powerful fellow, capable of defeating the
90,000,000 head
Gotti
of the
Fire Tank Pirates
with little effort.
During SWORD's assault on Hachinosu, Grus was a major asset in their plan to rescue Koby and was able to defeat multiple Blackbeard pirates without sustaining any major injuries.
Rokushiki
[
]
Grus is seemingly able to use
Soru
to move at a great speed.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Gunyo Gunyo no Mi
Grus ate the Gunyo Gunyo no Mi, a
Devil Fruit
of unknown class that gives him the power to create and control clay. He primarily uses this power to create clay golems that he puppeteers from afar to fight in his stead.
He can also use his clay in other ways, such as by shaping it into melee weapons that he can wield in direct combat, or by creating a large mass of mushy clay to cushion a fall.
Haki
[
]
Grus can use
Observation Haki
and
Armament Haki
.
History

Past
[
]
Grus was born into a rich family 29 years ago in the
West Blue
.
As a child Grus always looked down wherever he walked, bumping into walls, cows, people, and
pirates
. During these encounters with pirates, he was severely hurt and so his mother made him wear a cap with a long visor so he wouldn't bump into what's in front of him anymore.
Grus eventually joined the
Marines
two or more years ago, and took part in the same classes as
Koby
and
Helmeppo
as a Marine recruit.
At some point, he was promoted to
rear admiral
and joined
SWORD
.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Gang Bege's "Oh My Family"
[
]
While the
Levely
was ongoing, Grus and his squad patrolled through
Dressrosa
, where he managed to locate and arrest
Charlotte Lola
, thinking she was
Chiffon
(Lola's twin sister) of the
Fire Tank Pirates
.
Gotti
attempted to rescue her, but was swiftly defeated by Grus. However, Gotti was eventually successful in freeing Lola through a hit and run operation on Grus' battleship at one of Dressrosa's harbors.
Grus was then seen approaching the port as the Fire Tank Pirates escaped in to the sea.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
Weeks after Koby's abduction by
Marshall D. Teach
, Grus was approached by
Helmeppo
and
Hibari
in an attempt to convince him to do something about Koby's situation, either by invading
Hachinosu
or deploying a
Seraphim
to fight the
Blackbeard Pirates
. Considering both those requests insane, Grus explained SWORD's current inability to operate due to Drake's unknown whereabouts and asked them to remain calm for the time being.
Garp and SWORD battle the Blackbeard Pirates on Hachinosu.
Grus and his fellow SWORD eventually joined Vice-Admiral
Garp
to invade Hachinose to rescue Koby.
He later observed alongside
Kujaku
when Koby approached the battleship, enviously commenting on Koby's status as "Hero of the Navy", stating he would sabotage Koby.
On Hachinosu Grus helped Garp , Helmeppo and Koby fight off the pirates briefly asking Garp if he was also included as one of the future of the navy. When Koby ran off to save what appeared to be a civilian Grus warned him that it was a trap forcing Garp to save Koby by taking a stab from the Blackbeard pirate
Shiryu
, much to Grus and Helmeppos shock.
At the same time
Avalo Pizarro
attempted to use his
devil fruit ability
to destroy the marine ship carrying their troops on board, Garp told Koby destroys Pizarros's island sized hand while telling Grus to protect the ship from any falling debris as the the two sprung into action. Grus was skeptical about what Koby could do to the hand asking if he any bombs on his person but Koby managed to destroy the hand with a
powerful Haki impact
, as he did this Grus used
"Gunyo no Su"
to create a clay web to catch any debris from falling onboard the ship. As Grus and Koby got on board, they heard from Garp that he was staying behind, sacrificing himself to ensure the rest of them could get out safely. When Garp told them they were the future of the marines, this caused Grus to shed a tear at Garp's actions.
Grus listens to Vegapunk's broadcast as his allies recover.
Sometime later, the group made it to the
Marine GS General Hospital
for medical attention. During this time, they listened to
Vegapunk
's worldwide broadcast. Grus agreed with Koby that the message was leading to a troubling conclusion.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
While his surname "
Prince
"
(
プリンス
,
Purinsu
?
)
uses the Japanese pronunciation of the English word, his title or nickname "Prince"
(
王子
,
Ōji
?
)
uses the Japanese word for "a prince". This makes it impossible to distinguish between the two in a literal English translation. The
VIZ
translation initially rendered the use of the title as "Your Highness" to make the distinction,
but later switched to simply "Prince".
