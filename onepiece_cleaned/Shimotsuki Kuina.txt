Shimotsuki Kuina
was a childhood friend, relative and rival of
Roronoa Zoro
. She was the daughter of
Shimotsuki Koushirou
and the granddaughter of
Shimotsuki Kouzaburou
making her a descendant of
Wano Country
's famed
Shimotsuki Family
.
Her death at the age of eleven drove much of Zoro's ambitions as a
swordsman
, including his development of the
Three Sword Style
.
Appearance
[
]
She had short, dark blue hair and large, dark eyes. She wore a light pink short-sleeved shirt with a three-buttoned placket that she left unbuttoned, dark maroon shorts, and brown shoes. In the anime, while training at the dojo, she wore a white sleeveless shirt and cropped dark green pants.
Personality
[
]
Outwardly, Kuina was always self-assured and confident, bordering on arrogant toward fellow trainees. This, however, belied her fears—shaped by
Koushirou
's beliefs—that grown women could not match men in strength. As she dreamed of being the world's greatest swordsman, she came to resent her own body as an obstacle, and especially dreaded the onset of
puberty
.
These factors led to a complicated relationship between her and
Roronoa Zoro
, whom she often mocked as weak but simultaneously envied for being male. Eventually, on hearing him rebuke her fears and assert his own, egalitarian views on swordsmanship, she accepted him as both friend and rival.
Abilities and Powers

Swordsmanship
[
]
Kuina was a formidable child prodigy in swordsmanship despite her small frame, and stood as the Isshin Dojo's strongest pupil for some time prior to her death. During this time, she would defeat
Zoro
(who, although a year younger, could outmatch the dojo's adult trainees) on a regular basis.
Weapons
[
]
Like her fellow trainees, Kuina mainly fought with a bamboo
shinai
. However, she also appeared to be experienced with live steel, as she wielded the
Wado Ichimonji
in her final match against Zoro with no visible difficulty.

Biography
[
]
Zoro and Kuina making their promise to become the world's greatest swordsmen.
Kuina was born to
Koushirou
and his wife in
Shimotsuki Village
approximately two years after
Gold Roger
's execution (roughly contemporaneous with
Shiki
's escape from
Impel Down
).
Though Koushirou voiced concern over whether a daughter could properly inherit his dojo, his wife expressed hope for Kuina's strength. As a result, Kuina was duly trained in
swordsmanship
from a young age.
By age eleven, Kuina had become the dojo's strongest trainee, unbeatable by any other. Notably, she met two thousand bouts against the next-strongest trainee,
Roronoa Zoro
—and won all of them, much to Zoro's frustration. Despite this, her father maintained concerns that males would "naturally" surpass her swordsmanship with age, sowing a bitter anxiety within her.
Eventually, Kuina accepted a fresh challenge from Zoro: to fight a duel with genuine steel
swords
. In the dead of night, she brought her family's premier
Meito
Wado Ichimonji
against Zoro's own blades, and won once again. However, she celebrated little; as Zoro cursed his weakness, she confessed her own insecurities, including her dream of being the
world
's greatest swordsman and her jealousy that Zoro, as a male, could pursue it where she could not.
At first shocked, Zoro furiously rejected Kuina's reasoning, and insisted that only effort and skill, not birth, would decide their standings as swordsmen—and whether he would ever be able to defeat her. His faith heartened Kuina, and together they made a mutual vow: that one day, one of them would become the world's greatest swordsman.
Kuina's body after her death.
Unfortunately, this would be their last interaction, as Kuina accidentally fell down a staircase the next day, to a fatal impact. On seeing her lifeless body, Zoro tearfully accused her of breaking their vow; then, to subsume his grief and honor her memory, he swore anew to become a master swordsman that could fulfill their mutual dream.
Legacy
[
]
Kuina's memory would drive Zoro for the rest of his life, spurring him to adopt the Wado Ichimonji as his primary blade and develop the
Three Sword Style
to properly accommodate it. Roughly seven years after their final duel, Zoro would leave Shimotsuki Village to begin as a professional swordsman, with the ultimate goal of defeating
Dracule Mihawk
. Though not yet successful (as Mihawk easily overpowered him in their first encounter), Zoro currently stands as one of the world's most renowned swordsmen, as well as the second-most notorious member of the
Straw Hat Pirates
, behind only his
captain
, the
Emperor
Monkey D. Luffy
.
For a time, Kuina's memory would also cause Zoro considerable anxiety around
Tashigi
, a
Marine officer
nearly identical to her in both appearance and interests. However, this had mostly abated by the time the Straw Hats entered the
New World
.

Adaptation Differences

Anime Differences
[
]
While the manga depicts Kuina's backstory with Zoro in a single flashback during the
Romance Dawn Arc
, the
anime
replaces this with a handful of silent, context-free flashes, and moves the flashback proper to
the beginning of
the
Baratie Arc
. The anime version of the flashback also contains a number of expansions and changes:
In the manga, very little history is given between Kuina and Zoro outside their two thousand (and one) matches; the anime depicts their first meeting, with Zoro being a
dojo-challenging
delinquent who offers to become the Isshin Dojo's student if he loses and is immediately beaten by Kuina.
While the manga only mentions Koushirou's doubts about her secondhand, the anime depicts her directly overhearing and confronting her father and brooding over his words when she meets Zoro's live-steel challenge.
The anime also sets all of these events on the same day as her two-thousandth victory over Zoro.
After her vow with Zoro, the manga flashback immediately skips to her death. In contrast, the anime adds a brief scene where she demonstrates new ferocity against an adult instructor (the only time either medium depicts her fighting someone other than Zoro).
The manga openly depicts her corpse, being grieved over by Zoro and other trainees. The anime omits this, replacing it with a scene of her funeral (though the manga scene would later be adapted into
a flashback
in the anime original
Ocean's Dream Arc
).
The funeral scene mentions that she fell while searching for a whetstone to resharpen the Wado Ichimonji.
While the manga flashback ends on the day she dies, the anime adds several follow up scenes, including a moment where Koushirou reflects on how Zoro's rivalry had tempered her arrogance and spurred her to "surpass her natural limitations" as a woman.
The anime also depicts her grave in a scene showing Zoro's departure from Shimotsuki Village. Its manga equivalent (with a notably different design) would not appear until
From the Decks of the World
, after the
timeskip
.

Live-Action Differences
[
]
In the
live-action series
,
Roronoa Zoro
's flashback of his and Kuina's rivalry is introduced much later than in the manga: during the
Syrup Village Arc
, interspersed between original scenes of Zoro struggling to escape the bottom of a well.
In the manga, Kuina's self-doubt and anxiety over the strength of men and women stem from her father
Koushirou
's sexist remarks. In the live-action series, her father makes no such remarks. The cause of Kuina's death is simply stated to be an accident. Zoro receives Kuina's sword,
Wado Ichimonji
, during her funeral.
Kuina gives her full name "Shimotsuki Kuina" in the live-action series; her full name is not given in the manga, though it was revealed in
SBS Volume 105
.
