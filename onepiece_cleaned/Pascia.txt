Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Pascia's appearance is slightly altered in the anime. Her top originally had a tattoo-like design on the sleeves, which was removed. Also, a red gem was added to her headpiece.
In the anime, when Pascia was placed onto auction, Sanji expressed anger that the sellers would be so cruel to a beautiful girl, as opposed to the manga, where he simply asked Nami to buy her as well.
