Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, Samosa is only seen listening on as
Ham Burger
called the meeting into session. However, the anime expands his role with him conversing with other monarchs before the meeting began. The manga does not show who expressed worries about the cost of deploying the Marines, but the anime explicitly shows Samosa raising this problem. Furthermore, Samosa is not named in the manga.
