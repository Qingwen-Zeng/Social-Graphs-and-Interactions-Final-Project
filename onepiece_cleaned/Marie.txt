.
Appearance
[
]
Marie is a young woman with shoulder-length black hair and large dark eyes (depicted as dark brown in the anime). She is seen wearing a light pink nurse uniform that reached her upper thighs, with a red medical cross on the left side of her chest. She also wore a matching light pink nurse's cap, pink lipstick, a gold engagement ring on the middle finger of her right hand, and a pair of white pumps.
Personality
[
]
Marie appears to have been very dedicated to her job as a
nurse
, as she was willing to attempt to sneak by a
Celestial Dragon
while helping a dying man reach the hospital, rather than stopping to kneel. She was also visibly shaken after Charlos kicked her patient. She was extremely distraught and pleaded for her freedom as Charlos' guards began to apprehend her. Marie clearly loves her fiancé
Judy
, as she cried when he was shot and called for someone to help him despite the fact that she was being actively abducted.

As a crowd of people were kneeling to a passing
Celestial Dragon
,
Saint Charlos
, Marie and other medical staff attempted to sneak through the crowd to reach a nearby hospital while carrying a stretcher holding a man who was bleeding to death. However, they were noticed by Charlos, who was offended by their actions and kicked the stretcher and the man out of their hands. Charlos then noticed Marie in particular, and decided that he wanted to take her as his next wife. As she began to object to this, her fiancé
Judy
rushed out in an attempt to help her but was quickly shot by Charlos. She then begged for help as she was apprehended by Charlos' guards and taken to a harbor to be transported to
Mary Geoise
