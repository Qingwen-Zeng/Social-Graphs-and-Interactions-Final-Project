is a member of the
New Fish-Man Pirates
. He is a
Daggertooth pike conger
Fish-Man
.
He serves as a supporting antagonist in the
Fish-Man Island Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Hammond is a slim-looking bright yellow skinned Fish-Man with medium-length, puffy orange hair and a long and squarish neck with a small beard. His facial features are quite sinister: they include a long and sharp beak-like muzzle, razor-like teeth, and dark, glaring eyes. On his neck he has the tattoo of the
Arlong Pirates
symbol near his left shoulder, in honor of
Arlong
and his ideals. He also wears the
New Fish-Man Pirates
tattoo on the right side of his abdominals.
Hammond wears a long-sleeved black coat with a striped undershirt, both of which he keeps open to display his tattoos. Hammond wears shin-high, frayed white pants with a mint-green sash and black sandals. On his head he has a black fedora and earrings on both ears.
Personality
[
]
Hammond is a Fish-Man who, like Arlong, views humans as an inferior race. He is a very proud Fish-Man and extends this to other sea creatures, such as
Surume
, whom Hammond criticized for allowing
Luffy
to order him around. When meeting the
Straw Hat Pirates
, he gave them the ultimatum to either enlist under the banner of the
New Fish-Man Pirates
or die. Even in his arrogance, though, he is surprisingly thoughtful, as he carefully thought out the Straw Hats' list of offenses and appeasements to the Fish-Men, and was considerate enough to view pirates as enemies of humanity (despite most of them being humans themselves) that he gives them the choice of siding with them or being destroyed.
It also seems that he fears, or at least deeply respects his captain, since he was visibly nervous in his captain's presence.
Like many other characters, Hammond has his own
Laughter Style
: "
Hamo hamo hamo
".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a Fish-Man, Hammond is capable of breathing and surviving deep underwater without being in a bubble.
Hammond's strength and fighting style were never fully revealed, but as a Fish-Man, he is born with the strength that is tenfold of average humans, and even more so underwater.
Weapons

Utase Ami
(
打瀬網
,
Utase Ami
?
, literally meaning "Sailing Trawl Net")
: Hammond was first seen in battle when he used a rifle equipped with trawl nets, trying to capture the Straw Hats. Failing to do so, he was defeated by Luffy in one hit.
In the Viz manga, this is called
Bay-o-net
and in the FUNimation adaptations, this is called
Trawl Net
.
Dorei Tank
(
奴隷タンク
,
Dorei Tanku
?
, literally meaning "Slave Tank")
: Hammond rides on a platform with two cannons mounted on the front and one on the back. The platform is carried by enslaved human pirates in place of wheels, with four at the front and four at the back; if any of them fall from fatigue, Hammond simply finds a replacement, with the fallen one still being dragged on the ground by the chain around his neck. Upon
Nico Robin
freeing the humans, they threw the platform, alongside Hammond, away.

History

The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
One Piece Episode A
[
]
While the
Spade Pirates
were having a meal in Weston Den on
Fish-Man Island
, Hammond entered the restaurant alongside some other fish-men and started berating them. Though
Portgas D. Ace
tried to resolve this peacefully and politely, Hammond mentioned how the Great Pirate Era was all their (humans') fault and how their filthy (human) blood runs through their veins. Ace took it as an insult being directed at his
lineage
and knocked Hammond out with
Supreme King Haki
, before the Conger Eel fish-man could attack.

Fish-Man Island Saga
[

Fish-Man Island Arc
[
]
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
escaped the eruption of the undersea volcano, they were confronted by Hammond,
Hyouzou
, and
Kasagoba
, who were all riding on
Sea Beasts
. Hammond weighed
Monkey D. Luffy
's crimes against the
Arlong Pirates
but also took into account the Straw Hats protecting
Hatchan
and assaulting one of the
World Nobles
. He gave the Straw Hats a choice between joining the
New Fish-Man Pirates
or dying. Luffy rejected the offer.
The Straw Hats then used
Coup de Burst
to escape from the New Fish-Man Pirates and fly directly into
Fish-Man Island
. When asked what to do by a subordinate, Hammond said that they will go after them in case the Straw Hats are still alive, adding that it would be quite troublesome for their cause if the
Neptune Army
were to discover the pirates' presence within the island before they do. However, he and the other fish-men had to go to
Noah
and tell
Hody Jones
about the Straw Hats. After their report, Jones ordered Hammond to bring the pirates to him.
Hammond is easily defeated by Luffy.
Hammond spotted the Neptune Brothers visiting
Mermaid Cove
in search for the Straw Hats, and worried that the brothers were going to capture the Straw Hats. When Luffy,
Usopp
, and
Tony Tony Chopper
asked for a blood donation for
Sanji
, who had an extremely massive nosebleed, Hammond showed himself and told the Straw Hats about how
Fisher Tiger
died. After a gruesome battle, Fisher Tiger suffered critical blood loss and could have been saved with a blood transfusion, but humans refused to help him. Hammond went on to say that because of the humans who left Fisher Tiger to die, there is a law that prevents Fish-Men and merfolk from sharing blood with humans. He also stated that Hody Jones, the New Fish-Man Pirates' captain, wanted to see them. Hammond and his comrades attempted to capture the four Straw Hats by shooting a net at them, but Luffy repelled the New Fish-Man Pirates. One of their Sea Beasts tried to attack Luffy, but the Straw Hat captain subdued it with
Supreme King Haki
.
After the four Straw Hats left to find a blood donor for Sanji, Hyouzou carried the unconscious Hammond and Kasagoba.
During the battle in
Gyoncorde Plaza
, Hammond, who was still clearly recovering from Luffy's attack, rode on what he called the "Slave Tank", which was pulled by human pirate slaves. When one of the slaves passed out from exhaustion, Hammond told the others to leave him as they would get another.
Jinbe
asked
Nico Robin
to free the slaves, showing his disgust that the New Fish-Man Pirates were acting like the World Nobles, and she agreed to do so.
Hammond is defeated by Robin.
Robin managed to get the key to the slaves' shackles and freed them as requested. Once freed, the slaves threw Hammond to the ground. He recovered and tried to capture Robin with a trawl net but it only caught a clone made from her
Devil Fruit powers
. Robin then made a clone on Hammond's back where she grabbed Hammond's legs with multiple arms and performed a Double Clutch move, breaking Hammond's back.
Following the battle, he was likely put on probationary work with the rest of the lower-ranking members of his crew.
