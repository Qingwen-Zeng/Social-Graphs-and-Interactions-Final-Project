Manjaro
is a member of the
Fake Straw Hat Crew
and masqueraded as
Roronoa Zoro
.
When the crew switched to posing as the
Kid Pirates
, Manjaro impersonated
Heat
.
Appearance
[
]
Manjaro's disguise as Heat.
Manjaro is a man with a beer gut, chubby face, thick eyebrows, and thick lips. His hairstyle, earrings, and plain shirt are similar to those seen worn by the real
Zoro
, but otherwise, he is nothing like the real Zoro. He also wears a metal-studded belt, shorts with the number "34" on it, and white shoes.
When impersonating
Heat
, Manjaro has shaggy hair with a similar stringed corset and pants.
Personality
[
]
Manjaro is friendly with
fake Sanji
, unlike the real Zoro. However he is loyal to fake Luffy, automatically agreeing to forget about
fake Robin
just after fake Luffy ordered so. So far out of all the fake Straw Hats, fake Zoro (along with fake Sanji) has shown to be one of the most intelligent of the impostors, quickly identifying the real Chopper, discerning that Luffy (in disguise) has a connection with the real Straw Hats, and luring him to the fake Luffy without arousing the Straw Hat's suspicion.
Upon the truth coming out, he was discovered to be very cowardly, begging
Caribou
for mercy.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Typical for a fraud, he has no apparent fighting capabilities. He seems to lack stamina since he gets tired easily when running, running also causes his sides to hurt. He is very weak as he was easily brought to his knees by the Caribou Pirates.
Weapons
[
]
Like Zoro, Manjaro carries three swords, as though to emulate the
Three Sword Style
. However, they appear to be basic sabers rather than katanas, and he was never seen using the swords.
History
[
]
Fish-Man Island Saga
[
]
Return to Sabaody Arc
[
]
Manjaro was with the fake counterparts of
Sanji
,
Robin
and
Chopper
. When the four of them saw the
real Chopper
, they assumed that he was left behind when the real
Straw Hats
disappeared two years ago. They then planned on capturing him and discarding the fake counterpart to make themselves look more realistic. Shortly after that, the fake Robin and fake Chopper were captured by some unknown men,
and Manjaro and fake Sanji led the real Chopper (who believed they were real at the time) back to
their boss
. Black told them to forget about Cocoa (fake Robin), which drove Chopper away.
Upon reporting that he was the real Chopper, the fake Luffy ordered the fake Zoro and fake Sanji to capture him.
The two fakes, unable to find the real Chopper, encountered the
real Luffy
, who was disguised with a cloak and fake mustache. Though suspicious of his connections with the real Straw Hats, they failed to recognize him as the real one, and brought him back to their boss as Luffy believed them to be the real Zoro and Sanji.
Shortly after returning to the gathering, the Marines, along with
Sentomaru
and two Pacifistas attacked. Sentomaru easily defeated the fake Luffy and PX-5 revealed to the recruits that their "boss" is Demaro Black, a low-level pirate with a bounty of merely
26,000,000. Seeing the fury of the new recruits, Manjaro, along with the remaining fake counterparts, ran out of fear of being killed. When Luffy was forced to reveal himself due to the
Pacifista
's scanning scope, Manjaro, Drip, and
fake Sogeking
all foamed at the mouth from terror and shock.
Manjaro, along with the remaining Fake Straw Hats, begging for their lives.
Manjaro and the other Fake Straw Hats (except Black, Cocoa, and fake Chopper) somehow escaped the battle but are being held captive by Caribou and Coribou. The fakes beg for their lives as Coribou prepares to bury them alive.
