Quick Answers
What is Sabo's role in the Revolutionary Army?
Sabo plays a significant role in the Revolutionary Army in the world of One Piece. After being rescued by the Revolutionary Army, he was trained by Hack and Monkey D. Dragon due to his impressive combat skills, honed from his training with Ace and Luffy. Sabo quickly rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the Revolutionary Army's Chief of Staff. Despite his high-ranking position, Sabo is known for his casual relationship with the commanders and his tendency to leave his post during missions, which sometimes leads to disagreements with his peers.

Who are Sabo's sworn brothers in the world of One Piece?
In the thrilling world of One Piece, Sabo's sworn brothers are none other than Monkey D. Luffy and Portgas D. Ace. The trio solidified their brotherly bond through an informal sakazuki ceremony, a significant tradition in the pirate world. Despite the trials and tribulations they faced, their bond remained unbroken, their adventures together shaping them into the characters we know and love today.

What was Sabo's upbringing like before he ran away?
Sabo was born into nobility in the Goa Kingdom, but his upbringing was far from ideal. His parents were more concerned about their financial and social status than their son, making Sabo feel like a burden. This led him to run away from home at the age of 10 with dreams of becoming a pirate and writing a book about his travels. He met Ace and Luffy while living as a vagabond in Gray Terminal. However, his first attempt to set sail and escape his family was thwarted when his ship was destroyed by a World Noble. This event led to him losing his memory and devoting his life to the Revolutionary Army.

What was Sabo's initial goal when he decided to become a pirate?
Sabo's initial goal when he decided to become a pirate was to escape the overbearing rule of his noble parents who were more concerned about their financial and noble security than their son. He felt like a burden and alone in the world, hence his desire to become a pirate. He wanted to feel free and write a book about his adventures. His decision was also influenced by his bond with his brothers, Ace and Luffy, who shared similar dreams of freedom and adventure.

Appearance
Sabo was a 10-year-old boy at the time of Luffy's flashback, the same age as Ace at that time. He had round eyes, a missing tooth, and short curly blond hair. He wore a large black top hat with a pair of blue goggles wrapped around it, a blue jacket with the sleeves rolled up, a cravat and a pair of light blue cyan shorts held up by a belt with an elaborate flower-design buckle.
Before he entered into the Gray Terminal, he was seen with a gentle outfit with a white colored short-sleeved shirt and wearing blue colored shorts as usual.
As an adult, Sabo became taller and more muscular. He has matured greatly, with more pronounced facial symmetry and a scar he acquired over his left eye, which was inflicted when
Saint Jalmack
selfishly blew up the fishing boat Sabo used to set out to sea, leaving him with serious burns and critical injuries.
He resembles Luffy enough to allow him to easily deceive opponents as perceptive as Diamante into thinking he was "Lucy" by simply wearing the same outfit, although Sabo is still taller than his younger brother. His hair has also grown noticeably longer since his youth, which he styled deliberately to cover up his eye scar.
While participating in the final round at the Corrida Colosseum in Luffy's place, he wore Luffy's cape, fake beard, and viking style helmet. In addition, he wore shades to conceal his eyes. He also drew an X-shaped mark on his chest.
Later, after the round, he returned to his original outfit, which resembles his old outfit from twelve years ago: a long black jacket with a buckle on the left sleeve, with a blue shirt and vest, a frilled cravat, and a simple belt holding a pair of loosen light-blue pants with black boots (said boots are shown in greater detail in
Pirate Warriors 3
, to be wrapped with buckles and with cloth bracings). He also wears a pair of brown gloves and the same top hat with goggles over the band.

Personality
Sabo is devoted to his dreams to the point that he agreed with Ace that the two of them had to kill
Luffy
so that he could not tell anyone about their treasure, though neither Ace nor Sabo knew how to kill a person nor had any experience, implying some degree of innocence despite their profession.
According to Luffy, Sabo is a nicer older brother than Ace. He acknowledged Luffy's powers, and even encouraged his improvement. He helped Ace and Luffy get along when they were fighting, thus being the nice, diplomatic one of the trio.
Sabo's dream involves traveling around the world as a pirate. This is in order to write a book containing the story of everything he would see and every place he would visit during his journey. One of the reasons behind all this could be the "segregation" that envelopes so much of the Goa Kingdom, a thing that could easily stir a freedom-loving spirit like Sabo's to ask himself what the world was really like outside the walls of High Town, and outside the island itself. However, he was ready to cast aside his dream for the sake of his loved ones. Sabo was loyal to his friends and, in this case his two "brothers", to the point that he would give in to the demands of his father, becoming miserable and "alone" in order to save both Luffy and Ace. After reawakening his memories, Sabo did not leave the Revolutionary Army to resume his dream as a free-sailing pirate, demonstrating how dedicated and loyal he is to the companions he has made.
Despite being the son of a noble, Sabo does not act like a stereotypical noble would act, nor does he consider himself to be a noble. He does not look down on the less fortunate nor does he put on airs about his status. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the citizens of noble birth in Goa Kingdom including his family, who see their status as more important than anything else and will do whatever it takes to raise their social standing or maintain their current status, as well as look down on anyone they consider to be inferior. Sabo rejects these values completely, and even went as far as to say that he feels ashamed of his status as a noble. This can be seen as the reason why he ran away from home and went to live in the Gray Terminal, forfeiting his noble heritage. Since a child becomes a full-fledged noble at the age of eighteen, Sabo intended to leave the Goa Kingdom at the age of seventeen, to escape the idea of being recognized as the thing he hated the most. He even refers to the nobles as "smelling worse than Trash Mountain, as they are people rotten to the core". In fact, after Sabo learned about the attempt by the nobles of Goa to incinerate the Gray Terminal along with all the people who lived in it, Sabo became so enraged and disgusted that he came to hate and despise his own birth for being born into the nobility, stating that he would rather not have been born as a noble if he had the choice.
At age 22, Sabo has retained much of his old personality, although he appears to have adapted many mannerisms from Luffy, including his brother's tendency to mispronounce the names of others. Moreover, his tendency to hang up the Den Den Mushi in the middle of a call rather annoys his comrades. He has also displayed an immensely fierce protective streak towards Luffy, to the point where he will disregard everything he is currently doing if he feels that Luffy is in any sort of danger, including his duties in the Revolutionary Army. This is largely contributed by Sabo's inability to save Ace from death before the timeskip, a fact that Sabo still regrets to this very day. This is ironic considering that Ace himself had gained a very similar protective-streak after Sabo's presumed death.
Despite his recklessness and protective streak, Sabo demonstrates a pragmatic attitude in regards to his reputation and deeds as a revolutionary as shown when he reluctantly complied with
Nefertari Cobra
's plea to escape from Imu and the Five Elders assault to inform Dragon about the true ruler of the World Government. He also accepted being public condemned for assassinating a prominent royal due to the bolster the action provided for the
Revolutionary Army
's approval by the general public.
Relationships
Family
Outlook III
Outlook III, Sabo's father.
Outlook III
, Sabo's father is a stereotypical noble, treating Ace and Luffy as trash, and panicking about being contaminated when Bluejam got their blood onto him during a beating, claiming that he needed to be decontaminated. He also desired for his son to become his heir, believing that children must always adhere to the parents' wishes, and threatened to kill Ace and Luffy if Sabo did not comply. He ordered Sabo to marry a
princess
when he grew up, which is one of the reasons he ran away. In essence, Sabo had no right to freedom of choice in his father's eyes. What is worse, Outlook had no confidence in him, despite wanting him to return, going as far as to adopt a stepson of higher status in order to have a backup heir.
Outlook did have a look of shock on his face when Sabo was seemingly killed by Jalmack, though he may have been more surprised that his son would incur a World Noble's wrath.
Didit
Didit, Sabo's mother along with Sterry.
Didit
is Sabo's biological mother. Like her husband, she has the stereotypical personality of a
Noble
, and only seeks to further her family's status. This was clearly seen when her son got into a fight with a noble boy of a higher status who used a weapon on him and she apologized to the family while comforting the other boy, completely ignoring her own son's injuries. She also acted in a rather insensitive manner when Sabo was dragged back from his runaway, giving her son a somewhat rude welcome back.
Like Outlook, she appeared upset when Sabo seemingly died, though it may have been for a more selfish reason.
Sterry
While Sabo cared greatly for Luffy and Ace, he absolutely did not care for his adopted brother,
Sterry
, who came from a higher nobility than Sabo's family and is arrogant and cowardly. Sterry is, in short, a complete opposite to Sabo. To this end, Sabo was willing to assault Sterry in order to learn about the plan to burn down the
Gray Terminal
.
Twelve years later, Sabo posed as a guard at the
Levely
and reunited with his adopted brother while the latter was unaware of his identity. Sabo was silently amused by Sterry's fear of the outside world and assured him to maintain his cover.
Monkey D. Luffy
At first, when Luffy was secretly following Ace and had been caught, Sabo was worried that
Luffy
would reveal the secret stash that he and Ace had hidden, they suggested that they would kill Luffy for knowing. However, after seeing Luffy resist
Porchemy
and refusing to tell the secret stash, they inducted him into the group and treated him like a brother. Luffy also thought of Sabo as a kinder elder brother than Ace. Unlike Ace, who'd often mock Luffy's Devil Fruit powers or hit him in annoyance, Sabo encouraged Luffy, believing his powers to be handy and never hitting him. Prior to his departure from Goa, Sabo sent a letter to Ace, telling him to take care of Luffy as their younger brother.
Although he had amnesia for ten years and forgot Luffy and Ace. When Sabo regained his memories after Ace's death, Sabo resolved to protect his remaining brother at all costs.
After twelve years of assumed death, Luffy tearfully embraces Sabo upon their reunion in Dressrosa.
After twelve years of separation, when Sabo meets Luffy, Luffy at first did not recognize him. When Sabo boldly stated that he will win the
Mera Mera no Mi
, Luffy went mad and said that he will win it. However, when Sabo reveals his identity and mentions the day they became brothers, it greatly shocked and surprised Luffy. After he realized that Sabo was in front of him and alive, he started crying out of joy, thinking that he had died more than a decade ago. Luffy quickly embraced Sabo, while Sabo thanked Luffy for surviving the
Summit War of Marineford
. Luffy then let Sabo take up his disguise as Lucy to enter the finale in the Corrida Colosseum, allowing Sabo to take the Mera Mera no Mi and inherit Ace's power after talking it out with Luffy. Sabo later told Rebecca and Bartolomeo that Luffy will be the future Pirate King showing that he, like his deceased brother Ace, supports Luffy's dream.
It is shown that Sabo has gained an overprotective attitude towards Luffy as he held off Admiral
Fujitora
and told him that should Luffy ever need help, he would be there for him, having refused to ever lose another loved one ever again. He also came to Luffy's aid when
Jesus Burgess
attempted to kill Luffy firmly telling the Blackbeard pirate that Luffy is his brother, and he has to go through him to get to Luffy. In return, Luffy was very happy to see his brother again and was pleased to see that Sabo had inherited Ace's power.
Upon his departure from Dressrosa, Sabo visited Luffy again and gave the Straw Hats Luffy's
Vivre Card
, of which he took a piece, and entrusted Luffy's well-being into their care similar to what Ace had done. After Dressrosa, Sabo happily updated Dragon on Luffy's progress. Later, Sabo was very proud to see Luffy's new bounty poster.
After he read the newspaper detailing that Luffy had become the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea", Sabo was so proud of his younger brother that he smirked and grinned until his cheeks hurt.
Luffy has great faith in Sabo's morale and ideals of someone fighting for freedom, refusing to believe the newspaper article of him killing
Nefertari Cobra
.
However, unknown to him, Cobra tells Sabo that Luffy and Vivi needs to learn about the Will of D. as they bear the same initials, meaning that Sabo has to find Luffy as he witnessed Imu's knowledge of the name.
Portgas D. Ace
Ace
, being a fellow child who wants to be a pirate, was a good friend of Sabo's. In fact, they were like brothers, and Sabo was willing to forsake his dreams to save Ace and Luffy from his father's wrath.
Although Sabo had amnesia for more than half of his current life and forgot about Ace and Luffy, after reading about Ace's death in a newspaper article, Sabo regained his memories of Ace and the rest of the memories he had lost. This event, combined with the fact that he discovered that Ace had died all at the same time, put him into a coma for three days.
Two years after Ace's death, Sabo deeply regrets that he was not there to try and save his brother's life, and not a day went by where he did not agonize over what Ace's final thoughts might have been. He visited Ace's grave and left three cups of sake next to Ace's gravestone in the memory of their brotherhood, and pinned a newspaper article to the gravestone to indicate that Luffy is doing fine. Despite his regret, Sabo still remains determined to inherit Ace's power by obtaining the
Mera Mera no Mi
. He later looked to his late brother to watch over him as he entered the arena. Sabo obtained and then ate the Mera Mera no Mi, and the first attack he used with his new abilities was Ace's signature move,
Hiken
. Despite Sabo's grief, he took it upon himself to protect his remaining brother Luffy in Ace's stead and vowed to never live with any regrets ever again—as he believed Ace would never have forgiven him for it. Like Luffy, Sabo does not take too kindly to people insulting Ace as shown when Burgess insulted and mock his deceased brother, with Sabo unleashing a brutal fire attack on him despite him never intending to kill 'the Champion' in the first place.
Revolutionaries
Monkey D. Dragon
In the past,
Dragon
spared his time to listen to Sabo's story. He was openly affected by Sabo's morality and sympathized with the noble child for his refusal of his heritage.
He later rescued Sabo, who had his boat blown up by a World Noble named Jalmack, and brought him to the revolutionaries to treat his wounds. Because Sabo lost his memories of Luffy and Ace after this incident, Dragon was not aware that Sabo was a sworn brother to his son. He permitted him to join the Revolutionary Army after the boy begged them not to send him back to his parents.
After Sabo joined the revolutionaries, Dragon personally trained him, enabling him to rise through the ranks until he became the Revolutionary Army's chief of staff.
Because of Sabo regaining his memories during the aftermath of the Marineford War and the revelation of Luffy's heritage, it can be presumed Dragon was made aware of the relationship between Sabo and his son while Sabo learned of Dragon's relation to Luffy.
Sabo refers to Dragon as "Dragon-san" and is loyal to him and is trusted enough to lead the Revolutionary Army's investigation of the
Doflamingo Family
's weapons trade.
Even after regaining his memories, Sabo did not leave the revolutionaries to resume his dream of being a free-sailing pirate, showing a firm conviction to Dragon's cause.
After Doflamingo's defeat, Sabo personally told Dragon how Luffy was doing when giving his report.
Dragon trusts Sabo, respects and values him as a soldier and ally, however, he is not tolerant for actions that he considers unacceptable, as he has stated that even if Sabo was fine, he would not forgive him if he had actually killed Nefertari Cobra.
After escaping
Mary Geoise
and later
Lulusia Kingdom
, Sabo tell to Dragon what exactly happened at Mary Geoise. He revealed about the
Empty Throne
and
Imu
as well the truth about
King Cobra
's assassination at the hands of Imu and the
Five Elders
.
Koala
Koala scolds Sabo for disregarding his duties to fight Fujitora.
Sabo is on friendly terms with his subordinate
Koala
, having worked with her since they were both young teenagers. As a result, she became very upset and cried over the thought of Sabo leaving the revolutionaries after regaining his memories and knows about his history with Luffy and Ace and his regret about not being able to be at the
Summit War of Marineford
. Koala is happy for him when he finally reunites with his remaining brother, and also attempted to comfort him over any lingering feelings of regret he may feel over his inability to protect Ace, showing some closeness between the two. She also attends his battle at the Corrida Colosseum.
However, she is constantly frustrated with his selfish attitude in regards to disobeying orders as seen when she berates him for potentially drawing the ire of the Marines by fighting one of their Admirals.
After escaping from
Lulusia Kingdom
, Koala tries to kick Sabo for having her worried from the Lulusia Kingdom's destruction.
Hack
Sabo also works closely with
Hack
in the Revolutionary Army. However, he along with Koala, are occasionally at odds with Sabo over his tendency to leave his post during missions.
After being rescued by Dragon, Hack briefly trained amnesiac Sabo in martial arts. However, due to Sabo already being a skilled fighter due to his training alongside Ace and Luffy, there was little Hack could teach him, so Dragon took over Sabo's training personally.
Revolutionary Army Commanders
Sabo seems to have a causal relationship with the commanders despite being their senior officer. When
Lindbergh
informed Sabo that he and the other commanders would be late for Dragon's mobilization conference, Sabo was not worried and was only concerned they are safe.
When Sabo returned from his mission at Mary Geoise, he excluded the other commanders from his meeting with Dragon and
Emporio Ivankov
of witnessing
Imu
's sitting of the
Empty Throne
, in fear that all their lives would be at risk should they come to know.
Bartholomew Kuma
Kuma trains Sabo in fighting.
Sabo appears to be close to
Kuma
as he referred to him as gentle. Early in his life, he received some training from Kuma.
He was enraged at the news of Kuma's enslavement and torture by the Celestial Dragons. Sabo insisted on amending the Revolutionary Army's mission of infiltrating the Levely to rescue Kuma despite the risks it posed.
Friends
Curly Dadan
When Sabo was introduced to
Dadan
at first, she seemed annoyed of him. She even said that she had heard bad things about him. Sabo responded by saying that he had also heard bad things about her too. However, she was content with Sabo living with Ace and Luffy. Dadan was also stricken by Sabo's presumed death.
Years later, Dadan read of Sabo being still alive and a member of the Revolutionary Army, but she became distressed when the news alleged of him killing King
Nefertari Cobra
of
Arabasta Kingdom
.
Bartolomeo
Initially,
Bartolomeo
was hostile towards Sabo when the latter told Luffy he would not allow him to have the
Mera Mera no Mi
only to be pushed aside. When Sabo revealed himself as a brother to Luffy, Bartolomeo started to treat Sabo with great respect, referring to him as "great senpai." Though Sabo respects Bartolomeo enough because of him aiding them, he found Bartolomeo's obsession with the Straw Hats to be irritating.
Even after Doflamingo put a price on Sabo's head during his survival game, Bartolomeo did not betray the revolutionary and continued to assist him.
Rebecca
Sabo seemed to sympathize with
Rebecca
and her family after seeing Doflamingo's actions on Dressrosa. However, he wouldn't allow her to have the fruit of his late brother while she noticed he wasn't the same "Lucy" that she met.
However, Sabo ordered Bartolomeo to protect Rebecca from Diamante in the final match and saved her after he destroyed the arena.
Sabo later introduced himself and revealed his connection to the Lucy from before, as she was surprised by these facts.
Straw Hat Pirates
Following Doflamingo's defeat, Sabo met some of the
Straw Hats
and they were shocked to learn that Luffy had another brother before listening to Sabo's story of losing his memories. Before his departure, Sabo entrusted Luffy's care into the crew's hands to which they accepted with
Zoro
even remarking that Sabo's words were similar to what Ace said.
Though a portion of the crew had not met him yet due to being forced to depart for Zou, it was later established that they (with the exception of
Sanji
) were aware of his existence and his connection to Luffy.
Eventually, when the crew discussed the news of Sabo allegedly killing King Cobra, Sanji and
Jinbe
learned of the connection.
Nico Robin
Sabo appears to have developed a very friendly relationship with
Robin
, who was rescued by the revolutionaries just prior to the timeskip. He and Robin exchanged warm greetings with each other upon reuniting in Dressrosa.
Nefertari Cobra
Though the two only interacted briefly during their short encounter in
Pangaea Castle
when Sabo attempted to save
Cobra
from
Imu
and the
Five Elders
when Cobra learned of the former's existence, Cobra after impressing Sabo by stating Luffy had previously saved his life, willingly sacrificed himself to help give the revolutionary time to escape. Before his death, he imparted his final words for Sabo to locate and inform Vivi that the
Nefertari Family
bears the
Will of D.
and states the contents of
Nefertari D. Lili
's letter for Sabo to also pass down to Luffy and
Vivi
. Sabo was still crying when he remembered his failure to save Cobra.
Though Sabo was framed for Cobra's murder, he reluctantly decides to maintain this façade to help maintain the "flames of revolution".
Enemies
World Government/Marines
Due to Sabo being a part of the Revolutionaries, he is an enemy of the Marines, but more specifically, the
World Government
. As such he stopped
Admiral Fujitora
and his forces from advancing after Luffy.
A majority of them were surprised to learn that Sabo, Ace, and Luffy were brothers before they watched Sabo clashing with Fujitora.
Despite this enmity, Sabo wished Issho good luck with his dangerous gamble to leave Doflamingo's defeat in the hands of pirates.
However, they later have another confrontation at the
Levely
when Sabo and his comrades attempt to rescue
Bartholomew Kuma
from his enslavement by the
World Nobles
.
After the chaos in Big Mom's territory, the Marines became aware of Sabo's connection to Luffy.
Nobles
Having personally witnessed the cruelty of the nobles from his home in the Goa Kingdom, Sabo bears deep hatred towards them. Having learned of their attempt to kill all the people in the
Gray Terminal
, Sabo was the only person in the whole kingdom to try to save the people living there and was shocked and disgusted to see that the nobles in the kingdom knew what was happening but did nothing to help. He himself even told Dragon how he was ashamed of ever been born as a noble. Sabo left his home to make sure he never becomes like them.
Despite his grudge, he expresses sympathy and cooperation with nobles who care for their subjects, as demonstrated by his first conversation with
Rebecca
during the
Corrida Colosseum
tournament.
World Nobles
His loathing of nobles extends to the
World Nobles
as well, as during his departure twelve years ago, Saint
Jalmack
tried to kill Sabo solely because he crossed paths with his ship.
Sabo fully supported Dragon's intent to declare war on the World Nobles during the
Levely
, showing that he is not afraid to openly oppose them despite their privilege of summoning a Marine admiral for protection. He was furious at the Celestial Dragons abusing Bartholomew Kuma as a slave, and together with his comrades, launched an attack against
Mary Geoise
to both declare war and rescue Kuma.
Angered by the revolutionary's discovery of
Imu
and his attempt to assassinate their true monarch, the
Five Elders
tried to kill Sabo with extreme prejudice, but he escaped
Pangaea Castle
and made his way to the
Red Port
. However, Sabo was later framed for the murder of King Cobra afterwards.
Imu
Sabo fleeing after incurring the wrath of Imu and the Five Elders.
When Sabo found his way into the chamber with the
Empty Throne
he unintentionally discovered the existence of
Imu
and was both stunned and abhorred by the fact there was a sovereign that ruled the world from the shadows and unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Imu.
Jesus Burgess
As
Jesus Burgess
is a member of the
Blackbeard Pirates
, who turned Ace over to the World Government, Sabo holds him and his crew accountable for his death and the
Marineford War
2 years ago. Despite this, he claims that he would not bear a personal grudge against him or his crew for this but made it perfectly clear that he will protect
Luffy
to the end when Burgess attempted to kill him and take
his power
. Burgess in turn desired to kill Sabo and obtain the
Mera Mera no Mi
. However, he fails to kill him and is horribly injured by Sabo's Fire Fist, though he manages to survive and stowaway on board a ship that takes him to the
Revolutionary Army
's base at
Baltigo
, informing
Laffitte
and
Shiryu
he had discovered the Revolutionary Army's base.
As a result, the Blackbeard Pirates later attacked
Baltigo
, presumably in retaliation for Sabo's actions and his possession of the
Mera Mera no Mi
.
Donquixote Pirates
Sabo despised their rule on Dressrosa as he viewed it as similar to the injustice in his hometown. Sabo also sought to obtain the
Mera Mera no Mi
from them and took up Luffy's disguise as Lucy to do so and fought against
Diamante
for the fruit. Sabo infuriated the crew by actually consuming the fruit that they did not plan to give away. In response to his actions and other things, Doflamingo included Sabo in his list of "criminals" that he wanted the citizens to hunt down during his Birdcage game. Sabo was shocked to see he was included in this list.
Other
Monkey D. Garp
It is unknown how
Garp
and Sabo thought of each other, but Garp was once shown "training" him like Ace and Luffy. Sabo also mentioned to the Straw Hats that Garp kept him, Luffy, and Ace on a short leash and said so in a fond way, suggesting he did not mind Garp.
Abilities and Powers
As the chief of staff of the Revolutionary Army, Sabo has
command
over all lower ranking members, with only one direct superior, Supreme Commander
Dragon
, to answer to. His bounty of
602,000,000 proves that the
World Government
views him as an extremely dangerous threat. After the events of the
Levely
, Sabo is now known as the "Flame Emperor", with his reputation having skyrocketed to the point that he is now considered a legend, with his influence said to be even greater than that of his boss Dragon.
Even when he had not yet eaten a
Devil Fruit
, he rose to the position of second-in-command and was able to take on
Diamante
, a top executive of the
Donquixote Pirates
, as well as
Jesus Burgess
, the captain of the
Blackbeard Pirates
' first ship and one of their strongest members, without any difficulty.
After eating the
Mera Mera no Mi
, his power increased. He took on Admiral
Fujitora
and came out with only a few bruises, although Sabo suspected the Admiral was holding back.
Later, Sabo faced Burgess again and defeated him very easily.
According to Ace, who initially planned for Sabo to become his
navigator
, Sabo also has some experience in navigation.
Physical Abilities
Sabo possesses great fighting skills. As a child (even before joining the Revolutionary Army), Sabo already exhibited high physical capabilities and hand-to-hand combat from the very intense training he endured in the harsh environment of
Mt. Colubo
. He and Ace together were able to topple
Porchemy
, a massive man, when the two of them arrived to save Luffy. Sabo was able to beat Luffy, despite Luffy already having the power of the
Gomu Gomu no Mi
, fifty times in one day. He was also able to beat Ace twenty-four times, although he lost to Ace twenty-six times.
Sabo was good at thieving as well, since he and Ace were able to rob numerous people to get their money and valuables. He was fast enough to grab a knife from a pirate without the pirate being able to stop him. He also was exceptionally skilled in stealth and could jump out of a window several stories up without injuring himself.
After joining the Revolutionary Army, Sabo was personally trained by
Hack
and
Monkey D. Dragon
and attained immense physical potential. Of all the child revolutionaries who were soldiers-in-training, only Sabo excelled in the Revolutionary Army's rigorous combat training regimen, and
Hack
said that he does not need to be trained.
This is verified in the anime, when he faces the latter even as a child where he even surpassed him without any difficulty.
As an adult, Sabo is shown to have extraordinary agility as he easily dodged an attack from a Fighting Fish, as well as tremendous physical strength, clashing with
Jesus Burgess
, a pirate known for his titanic strength, with little difficulty.
He easily defeated Vice Admiral
Bastille
with a single grab that crushed his helmet and skull.
He also exhibits strength in his legs, as he was able to take down Burgess with a single kick.
Sabo's endurance is extraordinary, as he was able to survive a deep wound inflicted onto him by Imu while still escaping Pangaea Castle and reach
Red Port
without medical treatment.
Sabo has impressive stealth skills, being able to move through Pangaea Castle and make it to the Empty Throne room. He was able to hide his presence from Imu and the Five Elders until he made his move, shocking them since none of them notice Sabo at all, despite the Five Elders all being very skilled
Observation Haki
users. After escaping Imu and the Five Elders, he was soon able to get out of
Mary Geoise
and stowaway on
Lulusia Kingdom
ship without getting detected, all while being badly injured.

In his adulthood, Sabo has become a master of the Ryusoken fighting style, which revolves around the use of grips, which he refers to as "claws".
His grips are strong enough to break armor, great swords, artillery, and even skulls with ease and remaining unharmed. He claims that his fingers are like the claws of a dragon. He also uses Haki to increase the strength of his fingers. In contrast to Luffy, who readily chooses to target his adversary, Sabo seems to prefer destroying his opponent's weapon first before going head-to-head against them. This difference in battle approach was what allowed Diamante to notice that Lucy was not actually Luffy when Sabo came to fight in Luffy's place in the coliseum.
Devil Fruit
Further information:
Mera Mera no Mi
Sabo utilizing the power of the Mera Mera no Mi.
Sabo ate the Mera Mera no Mi, a
Logia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into fire. He initially showed difficulty controlling his powers, which is typically displayed by new Devil Fruit users.
He also mentions that he still has not grown fully accustomed to his new ability just yet, since he still has a habit of dodging attacks, despite now being a Logia-user.
He has adapted to his new abilities quickly and has since undergone training and practice to master his powers.
Sabo is able to utilize signature technique of his late sworn brother, Ace, the "Hiken", allowing him to transform his arm into a large, powerful fire blast. It is strong enough to shatter the bottom floor of the
Corrida Colosseum
, which was strong enough to support the weight of a
giant
, exposing the underground facilities.
Sabo can also use his flames to augment his Ryusoken style, as well as imbue flames into his weapons.
Haki
Main article:
Haki
Armament Haki
Sabo has shown great mastery in the usage of
Armament Haki
, which he can imbue into his arm or his pipe. His mastery of this type of Haki is superior to that of Burgess, the captain of the Blackbeard Pirates' first ship, as he broke Burgess's Haki-infused right arm armor.
Sabo also destroyed the
Corrida Colosseum
's fighting ring with his Haki-infused fists.
Observation Haki
Sabo possesses the ability to use
Observation Haki
.
In the anime, he is highly skilled in the use of Observation Haki, as he sensed that Luffy's Haki had become weak during the battle with Doflamingo,
and he dodged multiple bullets that were fired at him.
Weapons
Sabo's pipe.
As a child, Sabo's preferred method of combat was
stick fighting
using metal pipes (as well as having slight traces of bo-staff styles). After the timeskip, he continues to use a similar metal pipe, effectively battling against and defending himself from attacks by opponents as strong as Diamante and Burgess. When used in conjunction with Armament Haki, Sabo was able to easily break
Diamante
's weapon.
After obtaining the
Mera Mera no Mi
, Sabo can ignite the two ends of his pipe.
History
Past
Bound as Brothers
Sabo was born in the
Goa Kingdom
to noble parents who aspired for him to marry a royal princess to keep their family name secure but did not seem to care for Sabo as an individual. His father
Outlook III
, tired from work, was shown tearing apart a picture Sabo drew and ordering him to go to his room and study. One day, he got hurt in a fight with a boy from the royal family who used a knife, but Sabo's mother immediately began fretting over and apologizing in tears to the royal boy and his mother, being more concerned with repairing relations with the family and maintaining their status rather than tending her own son's injuries. Realizing he was nothing more than a way for his parents to secure wealth and status, Sabo fled to the
Gray Terminal
, leaving his parents to think he was dead. He would later meet
Ace
, and the two bonded over a shared dream to become pirates. They robbed people around Gray Terminal in order to collect treasure for their future pirating careers.
Sabo counting Ace's stolen loot.
During their get-togethers, Ace told Sabo about a boy named
Luffy
who had been following him unsuccessfully. Sabo recommended for Ace to live with him in Gray Terminal to avoid Luffy, but Ace had declined, and one day as they were counting money, Luffy reached Gray Terminal and overheard the boys talking about becoming pirates. They decided to kill him to keep their secret safe, but were unable to, and freed him once they heard pirates coming. A group of
Bluejam Pirates
, led by
Porchemy
, was searching for Ace to get back the money he had stolen from them, and they spotted and captured Luffy. Worried that the pirates would find their treasure, Sabo and Ace watched in shock as Porchemy carried Luffy away to interrogate him for Ace's location.
Sabo and Ace worked until evening to move their treasure somewhere else, and Sabo went to check on Luffy. He saw that Luffy had not told Porchemy anything yet and told Ace, and the duo broke into the pirates' hideout. Porchemy grabbed Ace, but Sabo hit the pirate with his staff before stealing another pirate's knife to cut Luffy free. Ace stayed behind to confront Porchemy, so Sabo joined him, and together the two defeated the pirate.
Sabo, Luffy, and Ace become sworn brothers.
Afterwards, after Ace talked to Luffy about his actions, Sabo told them that they would become infamous among the pirates in Gray Terminal, so he went to stay with Ace's and Luffy's guardian
Curly Dadan
. The three of them adventured throughout the island, fighting with animals, hoodlums, pirates, and each other as their reputation grew to reach the center of the kingdom.
One day, they snuck into the Goa Kingdom, ate at a restaurant, and broke out without paying. While they were running, Sabo's father noticed him and called out to him to come back, but Sabo tried to ignore him. He told Luffy and Ace that his father's call must have been a mistake, but they did not believe him, and he confessed his past once they returned to Gray Terminal. Sabo proclaimed that he wanted to sail the world and write a book about everything he found, and Ace and Luffy proclaimed their dreams as well. While they were discussing their future pirating lives, Ace poured them cups of sake, which they
exchanged to become sworn brothers
. The three brothers continued their lives of adventure for the next few months, and at one point moved out of Dadan's hideout to live in a treehouse.
At some point, Sabo asked Ace and Luffy about the 'D' in their name, thus neither care too much about it.
Running from a Disgusting City
One day, Sabo was apprehended by his father and the Bluejam Pirates. Outlook III gave Bluejam permission to do what they wanted with Ace and Luffy, but Sabo agreed to return to his old life without a fuss if his brothers were spared, and he was taken back to Goa's Elite District.
At a checkpoint, Sabo was coerced into claiming that Ace and Luffy implicated him in their crimes in order to maintain his family's status. He refused, forcing his father to bribe the official. He then returned to his old house, where he reunited with his mother and met his adopted brother
Sterry
for the first time. After being bathed, he was introduced to Sterry, who revealed to him that the nobles had arranged for Gray Terminal to be burned down the next night. Sabo became enraged as he realized that the "trash" the nobles wanted burned included the people on Gray Terminal, and he jumped out of the window. After sneaking up to a building, he confirmed what Sterry said as he heard about the detailed plans to burn down Gray Terminal.
The next morning, Sabo met with his private tutor, but was distracted by the realization that everyone else was carrying on as normal despite the planned genocide. He escaped from his house again, and talked to two men on the street who, to his shock, knew perfectly well what was going to happen. He was then spotted by some police officers looking for him, forcing him to run away.
As night fell, Sabo came to the gate leading to Gray Terminal. With the area already set ablaze, Sabo tried shouting to Ace and Luffy across the wall for them to get to safety, causing him to be spotted by some guards who were evacuating the city near the Terminal. He ended up falling onto the road, in front of
Monkey D. Dragon
. Sabo told Dragon that the nobles' hearts were rottener than the trash on Gray Terminal and said that he was ashamed to have been born as one, and Dragon took his words to heart.
Sabo's signature hat floating beside the flaming wreck of his boat.
Sabo decided to leave Goa and its stench and wrote a letter to Ace and Luffy explaining his actions and hoping to meet again as pirates.
The next morning, he went and set sail on a stolen fishing boat,
intending to never return. He immediately encountered the massive ship of the
World Noble
Saint
Jalmack
, who was coming to Goa. He sailed out of its way, but Jalmack was offended that he had crossed his path and so shot his vessel with a bazooka. Sabo desperately tried fanning the flames of the explosion caused by the first shot but was caught in the second shot as it destroyed the ship entirely.
Dragon saves Sabo.
Heavily injured by the explosion and on the verge of drowning, Sabo was rescued from the wreckage by Dragon. Dragon carried the unconscious boy to the Revolutionary Army's ship at
Shimotsuki Village
during the night, where his injuries were immediately treated by the crew.
Joining the Revolutionary Army
When he woke up, he was diagnosed with
amnesia
as he could not even remember his own name. Dragon mentioned that Sabo was the son of a noble and thus a member of the Army suggested returning him to his family. Sabo immediately refused, still having the feeling that he must not return to his parents no matter what.
Although he survived, everybody who knew him (including Ace and Luffy) believed he was dead.
Sabo remained with the Revolutionaries from that point on, where he eventually became committed to their ideologies. Sabo was trained along with many other orphans by the fish-man
Hack
but was already so strong that Hack had nothing to teach him. At age thirteen, Sabo trained under Dragon and later trained with
Bartholomew Kuma
.
One year later,
Koala
joined the Revolutionary Army and she, Sabo, and Hack went on missions together.
Eventually, in time, Sabo rose to ranks and became the Chief of Staff—the No. 2 of the entire organization. Three and a half years before the current storyline, Sabo, Hack and Koala learned that Kuma had become a member of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
much to their disbelief as that would effectively make him a servant of the
World Government
.
Sometime later, at the Revolutionary Army's HQ, Sabo was present with Dragon upon hearing from one of their comrades that Kuma saved them during a mission but left without a word.
After Luffy's first bounty poster became public, Sabo was told by Dragon that he was going to
Loguetown
asking him who was in charge of the area, to which Sabo told him the territory was overseen by
Smoker
.
After learning that Ace was killed, Sabo's memories return to him as he cries out in anguish.
Because he forgot who Ace and Luffy were, Sabo did not participate in the
Summit War of Marineford
to attempt to save Ace's life. However, after discovering the news that Ace was killed in the war from a newspaper article, Sabo's memories of Ace quickly returned to him after seeing his photo, which in turn brought back the rest of his lost memories. Finally remembering their brotherhood, Sabo became grief-stricken from the loss of his brother and his powerlessness to save him. This grief and the shock of his memories returning caused Sabo to come down with a high fever and was unconscious for three days.
Sabo eventually discovered that Luffy had survived the battle. At that point, Sabo resolved to protect his remaining brother at all costs, and that he would come to Luffy's aid wherever and whenever he needed him,
and that would not feel the grief of losing a brother ever again, having refused to live life with any more regrets—something he believed Ace would have never forgiven him for. Since Ace died, not a day went by where Sabo did not agonize over what his final thoughts were.
Afterwards, some time before his arrival in
Dressrosa
, Sabo visited Ace's grave and left a bottle of sake with three cups on a small crate as a tribute to the day they became brothers, as well as pinning a newspaper article about the Straw Hats' return to the gravestone.
Sabo eventually requested permission for him to obtain the
Mera Mera no Mi
,
as he wished to eat it in order to inherit Ace's power.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the

story.
Episode of Sabo
Sabo promises to inherit Ace's power.
Finally arriving at Ace and Whitebeard's gravesite, Sabo pinned a newspaper article about the Straw Hats to Ace's tomb stone and told his late brother that Luffy was well on his way to becoming King of the Pirates. After recalling his childhood with Ace and Luffy, Sabo tearfully broke down and apologized for not being able to save him. Sabo then drank from one of the three cups of sake he left in front of the grave and told Ace that he would inherit his power.
Later on, Sabo arrived in Dressrosa incognito, ordering a plentiful amount of food from the restaurant as Koala (who was sitting directly behind him, facing the opposite side) informed him on the situation in Dressrosa. After finishing eating, Koala told him that the only places they have not looked for the underground weapons' trade was the Royal Palace and Corrida Colosseum. Deciding to check the Colosseum first, Sabo disguised himself in a large brown cloak and went to sign up for the tournament. To Sabo's shock, Doflamingo revealed to the city that the prize for the tournament was the Mera Mera no Mi, the Devil Fruit of his late brother Ace.
After meeting up with Hack momentarily, Sabo observed the mistreatment of a toy slave being beaten and abused by its overseer, causing Sabo to declare to himself that he would expose the darkness of Dressrosa. As Sabo observed the fighting, he immediately recognized the fighter "Lucy" as Luffy, as his thoughts drifted to his childhood.
Sabo reveals himself to Luffy.
Deciding that he would need to win the Mera Mera no Mi himself (as Hack had lost early into the competition), Sabo finally decided to reveal himself to Luffy, telling his brother that he would not let him eat the Mera Mera no Mi. As an angered Luffy challenged him to a fight, Sabo reminded Luffy that he had another brother besides Ace. As Luffy continuously told Sabo that his "other brother" was dead, he quickly realized that the man standing before him was Sabo, who happily noted how long it had been since they last met. Luffy later gave Sabo his "Lucy" disguise to allow him to fight for the fruit. As Sabo entered the waiting room, he was confronted by Rebecca, who noticed that he was not the same Lucy as before. Sabo told Rebecca that even though things would get rough, he would not do wrong by her, and noted the similarities between Dressrosa and his childhood country. After entering the arena to engage in the final round, Sabo clashed with Jesus Burgess using his Dragon Claw.
Sabo uses "Hiken" to blow a hole in the floor of the colosseum.
After all the toys in Dressrosa turned back to normal, Sabo took advantage of the chaos to destroy the arena and claim the Mera Mera no Mi while everyone else was struggling in the whirlpool he created. After eating the fruit, Sabo saved a falling Rebecca and told her of his identity. Declaring to Ace that they would continue to seek freedom together, Sabo activated his fruit's powers and used "Hiken" to blow a hole in the floor of the stadium.

Dressrosa Saga
Dressrosa Arc
Sabo, Koala, and Hack arrived at Dressrosa in order to put a stop to a weapons trade that the Donquixote Family managed.
Sabo reunites with Luffy after 12 years.
During the Block D fight, he somehow managed to get inside the Corrida Colosseum. He interrupted
Bartolomeo
and Luffy's conversation and stated that the
Mera Mera no Mi
could not be given to Luffy. Bartolomeo responded with anger, explaining that Sabo had no right to speak to the brother of "Fire-Fist Ace" and the future
Pirate King
in such a manner. Sabo responded that he knew these things about Luffy already. After pushing Bartolomeo aside, Sabo revealed himself to Luffy.
After Luffy questioned who Sabo was and how he saw through Luffy's disguise, Sabo informed Luffy that he could never forget his little brother's face. Upon realizing his identity, Luffy began to cry and screamed out in surprise, clinging to Sabo with joy. Sabo expressed his relief that Luffy was alive and asked for Luffy's permission to eat the Mera Mera no Mi, which Luffy gladly granted.
After Luffy escaped the colosseum, Sabo talked to
Koala
via
Den Den Mushi
, telling her of his meeting with Luffy. Koala told him that even if he had been at the
Summit War of Marineford
, he could not have changed anything. It was then revealed that Sabo had put on Luffy's former gladiator clothing and had taken on the identity of Lucy. Sabo then told Koala to inform him if any more news about the underground is found, and then said that he is going to get Ace's fruit back. Sabo then states that he must inherit Ace's power as he walks towards the arena.
He was then seen standing next to Bartolomeo at the observation deck. After every big-name fighter in Block D was struck down rather quickly, Sabo commented that he heard rumors of a certain individual, referring to
Cavendish
's alter-ego, Hakuba.
When
Rebecca
was the only one who stood back up and declared the winner of Block D, Sabo praised her for being able to avoid Hakuba's attack. However, Sabo also stated that he would still not let her win the Mera Mera no Mi.
Sabo enters the arena.
He later met Rebecca after she left the arena. She waved to him but then noticed that he was not the same Lucy she knew. Sabo briefly spoke to her and then walked by noting to himself how similar Dressrosa was to the country he and Luffy grew up in. When the finals were about to start, Sabo was the first to enter the arena, cheerfully asking Ace to watch over him.
Once the other block winners and
Diamante
were present in the arena, Sabo took a mental note of
Burgess
. After Diamante explained the rules of this round, a five-person battle royale commenced. Sabo was later seen easily dodging an attack from a
Fighting Fish
.
Sabo and Burgess clash.
When the fighting fish holding the Mera Mera no Mi came close to the arena, Sabo jumped on to it. Diamante attempted to attack him, but Sabo was able to break his weapon. Burgess attempted to take out both of them with his Surge Elbow, but Sabo took him head-on with his
Armament Haki
infused Dragon Talon and managed to break the armor surrounding his right arm. He commented that getting the fruit would not be easy.
Later, when Rebecca took a blow from Diamante, Sabo asked Bartolomeo to protect her.
Sabo continued to engage Burgess in heated combat with their clash causing more damage to the colosseum.
Sabo eats the Mera Mera no Mi.
When all the toys in the audience transformed back into their original forms, Sabo proceeded to demolish the entire fighting platform.
As the ring collapsed into the underground, Sabo quickly jumped on the Fighting Fish holding the Mera Mera no Mi. He ripped open the chest and after landing back in the core of the ring and telling the announcer that he had won, took a bite out of the fruit, expressing how disgusting it tasted immediately afterwards. He then grabbed Rebecca and jumped into the air as his helmet and fake beard fell off. While in midair, he used Hiken and completely destroyed the arena and exposed the underground.
After saving Rebecca and getting to safety, Koala returned his clothes to him, as Sabo continued to have a hard time controlling the fruit's power. After Rebecca noticed that he was not the original Lucy, Sabo confirmed this and told her that the old Lucy was his younger brother, Luffy, and that they were from the Revolutionary Army. He also informed Rebecca that they were there to stop the production of weapons that were promoting wars all over the world, and the place where they were produced was located somewhere else, declaring that it would be a nice souvenir for Dragon if they found it.
After he and Koala reunited with
Robin
and met
Usopp
, they later watched in shock as Doflamingo initiated his "bird cage" plan and created a "game" which gives the citizens of Dressrosa a choice to either kill him or a list of people he offers to them.
Sabo included in Doflamingo's list of targets.
After Doflamingo announced his hit list, Sabo was surprised to see that he was included in the list alongside Rebecca, Robin, and Usopp. When the former toys who swore their loyalty to Usopp became their enemies, Sabo, Koala, Hack, Usopp, Robin, Rebecca, Bartolomeo, and the Tontatta dwarves fled from the mob.
Sabo separated from the group while escaping.
Sabo clashes with Issho.
While Luffy and his allies from the colosseum charged up the New King's Plateau to reach Doflamingo, Sabo was shown preventing
Fujitora
and the Marines from going after them. Fujitora asked Sabo if that was his duty as a revolutionary. Sabo replied that he was doing his duty as a brother.
Sabo then overwhelmed several Marines. When
Bastille
charged at him, he effortlessly destroyed Bastille's sword right before dealing the finishing blow to the vice admiral. After crushing Bastille's mask, Sabo revealed his relation to Luffy and Ace before clashing against Fujitora.
As the battle raged on, Sabo asked Fujitora why he was acting oblivious. Fujitora admitted his bluff and jokingly asked Sabo to show mercy towards him due to his blindness. Sabo then told the admiral that he does not discriminate against anyone. Fujitora noted that Sabo was not all talk after all, but asserted that he also had a title and reputation to maintain and used
Gravito: Moko
to make gravity go horizontally with enormous pressure, destroying several buildings in the process as the sheer force made Sabo burst into flames as he charged forward, clashing with Fujitora once more, causing Sabo to ponder just what the admiral was plotting. Fujitora then told the young revolutionary that he was willing to bet his life on their fight.
Fujitora ultimately decided to end their battle after revealing his views on how it was impossible for even the Marines to become heroes. When Sabo asked him about what would happen if someone discovered how he feels, Fujitora called it a gamble and wished Sabo good luck. After resting for a while after the fight, Sabo received a scolding from Koala, who reprimanded him for not maintaining his position and potentially risking the Revolutionaries being forced into war by fighting with an admiral. Dismissing his duties because of Luffy being in danger, Koala violently pinched his cheeks and scolded him for his selfishness.
Sabo was later seen helping the Dressrosa citizens, saving the last of which from a falling stone wall.
Afterwards, he went back to the colosseum and freed the prisoners there. Koala then contacted him, telling him to come to the palace. While reluctant, Sabo quickly changed his tune when she told him Luffy's life would be in danger, and he quickly made his way to the palace.
Sabo kicks Burgess away from Luffy.
On the way to the palace, Sabo noticed that the Birdcage is shrinking.
When Burgess entered the fray in an attempt to kill Luffy and take his Devil Fruit for himself, Koala quickly alerted Sabo, but Sabo did not reply. When Burgess finally made his move and attacked, Sabo intervened and kicked him away, smiling at a relieved Luffy afterwards.
Sabo then informed Burgess of his relationship to Luffy and Burgess realized that Sabo was the Lucy who fought in the colosseum finals. After Luffy promised to defeat Doflamingo once he recovered, Sabo entrusted Gatz to him. Burgess then decided to take Sabo's Devil Fruit power and the two subsequently clashed. Sabo attacked Burgess with
Moeru Ryusoken: Kaen Ryuo
, sending Burgess crashing through several buildings.
Enraged after being taunted about Ace's death, Sabo uses Hiken against Burgess.
Sabo later defeated Burgess by the time Luffy defeated Doflamingo. Burgess asked Sabo if he was going to kill him, but Sabo replied that he had no need to. Burgess then taunted Sabo by telling him what Ace said after Blackbeard captured him. In anguish, Sabo then grabbed Burgess on the face. Burgess grabbed his knife and went in for the kill, but Sabo blew him away with
Hiken
. Sabo was then contacted by Koala, who was waiting for him at the underground trade port. Sabo asked Koala if she found a list before hanging up on her.
Sabo reveals his past to the Straw Hats.
After things had settled down and Luffy and his friends went to
Kyros
' house to rest, Sabo went there during the night to see Luffy's face one last time. He told Robin that he would be leaving Dressrosa because
CP0
was coming back for the revolutionaries. After
Zoro
expressed his surprise at discovering that Luffy had another brother besides Ace, Sabo noted that it was probably most surprising for Luffy, as he had thought he was dead. He then went on to explain his past to Zoro,
Franky
, and Robin.
Sabo departs for the harbor to rendezvous with Koala and Hack.
Before departing, he gave Zoro a
Vivre Card
for Luffy and kept a piece for himself. He then entrusted Luffy's safety to the
Straw Hats
before leaving the house, something Zoro found amusing, since Ace had done the same thing two years prior when they met in Arabasta. Sabo then contacted Hack before heading for the harbor
on a flock of birds
.
The revolutionaries later left Dressrosa and they apparently took all the weapons and evidence relating to the Donquixote Family's smuggling operation before CP0 could recover them.

Sabo was able to infiltrate the castle sneakily and defeat the guards who were holding the keys for Kuma. He also briefly encountered
Jewelry Bonney
during his infiltration, whom he was surprised to see in such a dangerous place, and even more to be Kuma's daughter. When one of Karasu's crows approached them, Sabo handed over the keys for Kuma's cuffs, telling them to retreat as soon as they saved Kuma. Sabo asked Bonney about her plans after the
Levely
, to which she replied that she was heading to
Egghead
for information from
Vegapunk
. Sabo then saved her from guards and overheard their conversation about a so called "Lost Chamber", piquing Sabo's attention. He then bid farewell to Bonney, telling her where to go to get to Egghead before making his way inside the castle again.
Sabo attacks the Five Elders.
The mission was a success and his group escaped

's throne room, where he witnessed the
Five Elders
and
Imu
about to execute
Nefertari Cobra
. Sabo then attacked with
Hiken
and
Otebisha
, prompting the Elders and Imu to transform and strike back. Cobra questioned why Sabo would save him, and Sabo replied that the Revolutionary Army's true goal is to take down the World Nobles. As the two tried to escape, Cobra mentioned that the
Nefertari Family
carries the
Will of D.
, which caused Sabo to remember that both of his sworn brothers also had it. The two were then struck down, and Cobra sacrificed himself to allow Sabo to escape. As his last words before death, Cobra told Sabo to get the message out to Luffy and
Vivi
.
Following his escape from Mary Geoise, Sabo was framed as the one who assassinated Cobra.
Final Saga
Egghead Arc
Because of the injuries he sustained trying to save Cobra, Sabo ending up being separated from the rest of the commanders, and he went to hide in
Lulusia Kingdom
,
one of the eight kingdoms that were
overthrown
due to inspiration from the Revolutionary Army, of which Sabo's alleged murder of Cobra made him more popular than even Dragon himself.
Sabo managed to contact the Revolutionary Army, but because he could not acquire a White Den Den Mushi to jam the signal, the message he sent was a relay call that the Marines were able to listen in and trace,
accurately predicting they would assume he was still on the island. In truth, he had already left with several people from the kingdom who had been inspired to take up arms against the World Government.
Sabo affirmed in his message to his fellow Revolutionaries that he was not the one who killed Cobra. However, before he could fully report his findings of the Empty Throne to them, Imu destroyed Lulusia and the
Five Elders
ordered the Marines to forget the interception, claiming that Lulusia had never existed to begin with.
Sabo informing Dragon and Ivankov about the Levely.
Lacking a White Den Den Mushi meant he had to go radio silent for a while, though he was able to send an indirect call signal to inform his allies that he was okay. He eventually made it to
Momoiro Island
with the Lulusia survivors and had a private meeting called with only himself, Ivankov, and Dragon attending, as he feared what he saw at the Levely would put everyone else in danger should they hear.
During the meeting, Sabo confirmed to Dragon and Ivankov that the rescue team achieved all its three core missions: to destroy the symbol of the World Nobles, effectively declaring war on the World Government, save Kuma and all the slaves present at Marie Geoise and destroy the food supply, leaving the World Nobles to starve. When Dragon told Sabo about Cobra's death leading to Sabo being celebrated as a hero publicly, Sabo did show pity for Cobra's death having such an impact, but stated he would accept the burden if it meant the rebellion could go on. Ivankov then showed the article to Sabo which reported the assassination, making Sabo recount the events at the Levely and the mission.
Sabo ends his report with how he witnessed Lulusia's destruction, and when he told Dragon and Ivankov about Imu, he reacts with surprise from Ivankov's theory that the very Imu he encountered was the same
Nerona Imu
from the First Twenty, having achieved eternal youth.{
Sometime after, Sabo, Koala, Morley and their fellow revolutionaries watched Vegapunk's broadcasted message that was scheduled to reveal the
world
's secrets in the next ten minutes.
While the Revolutionaries were shocked at the broadcast's revelation that the events of the Void Century caused the ancient world to sink into the ocean, leaving only mere pieces of that continent left, Sabo remained silent.
When Vegapunk addressed those with the initial D., Sabo took interest because of Ace and Luffy.
With the broadcast nearing it's end, Sabo listens to Vegapunk as he states that the fate of the world will be decided by whoever is able to claim the One Piece.
Following the end of the broadcast the revolutionaries discussed the revelations of Vegapunk's message. Sabo recognized that the World Noble's choice live atop the Red line, the highest elevation in the world, now made sense due to the rising sea level.

Anime and Manga Differences
Knowledge of Ace's Heritage
In the manga, it is unknown whether or not Sabo was aware of Ace being
Gol D. Roger
's son. In the anime, he was fully aware of this fact, as well as the one who informed Luffy of it.
3D
2Y
Sabo visiting Ace's grave.
In the ending credit of
3D
2Y
, Sabo was shown placing the sake cups in front of Ace's grave. Although he did so in the manga as well, the actual action was not seen there. This may serve as a major spoiler as the special was shown before the episode in which Sabo was revealed to be alive, even though his actual face was not shown in the at this instance. Also, the conversation between Luffy and Sabo during their reunion was slightly different, due to the special being produced before their conversation was revealed in
Chapter 794
.
Dressrosa Arc
The anime reintroduces Sabo an episode before he meets Luffy and Bartolomeo, where he is seen briefly looking at the entrance to the arena inside the colosseum before setting off to find Luffy.
Additionally, the anime also adds dialogue to their reunion, contrary to the manga chapter it was based off of. As a result, this dialogue ultimately ended up contradicting the manga—as Sabo's reunion with Luffy was fully revealed in a later chapter—dialogue included. As a result, the improvised greeting Sabo gives to Luffy in the anime is omitted in
Episode 738
, which adapts the full reunion from the manga.
During the flashback of Sabo's past, the anime showcases his time with the revolutionaries up until the present timeline, even though his training with Hack and subsequent missions as a Revolutionary have not been shown in the manga chapter the episodes were based on. These non-canon scenes also depict how he started utilizing a pipe as his weapon of choice again. Additionally, the scene of Sabo visiting Ace's grave from Episode of Sabo was used in the following episode.
During a revolutionary mission in
Episode 737
, Sabo was shown using
Observation Haki
to dodge gunfire, which he had shown no usage of in the manga.
Translation and Dub Issues
Although Sabo's rank of
Sanbō sōchō
(参謀総長) is commonly translated as Chief of Staff, it differs from the actual translation of Chief of Staff, which would be
Sanbō-chō
(参謀長), as used by
Cabaji
. However, this difference is lost in common translation. On the other hand, Chief of the General Staff would be a more proper translation as it reflects the usage of
sō
(総) and is commonly translated as such for real-world military positions.
