Brag Men
is a famous book which contains many stories from the
Grand Line
. It is mentioned to be a collection of journals from explorers of the distant past.
Due to the nature of the stories, many people mock them, and so the book was named to discredit their authors as "liars"
(

)
.
The book is labeled as "fiction romance".
History
[
]
Creation of the Book
[
]
The only portion of Brag Men that has appeared in the series was written by the explorer
Louis Arnote
(
ルイ・アーノート
,
Rui Ānōto
?
, VIZ Media: Louis Arnot)
. It describes the island of
Little Garden
and reveals the origin of its name.
Due to Louis Arnote mentioning
giants
inhabiting the island, the book must have originally been published less than 100 years ago, as that is when
Dorry
and
Brogy
began living on Little Garden.
Ohara

Brag Men can be seen among the books saved from the Buster Call on Ohara.
Brag Men was one of the many books kept in the
Tree of Knowledge
located on the island of
Ohara
in the
West Blue
. Twenty-two years ago, it was among the books saved by the
archaeologists
of Ohara from the destruction caused by a
Buster Call
on the island.
It is suggested that, due to the efforts of these scholars, the book survived to be mass-produced at a later date.

Straw Hat Pirates

Nami
owns a copy of Brag Men. After the
Straw Hat Pirates
landed on Little Garden, she recalled previously having read about the island from the book. She then searched for her copy in her bedroom, and after finding it, rushed out to warn the crew about the island.
The Straw Hats' adventures are said to be a looking glass into these so-called "lies", allowing readers to decide for themselves whether the stories within Brag Men are true or not.
