S-Bear's concept art.
S-Bear resembles Kuma as a child, but has longer hair and wears an outfit more reminiscent of the current Kuma, with an emblem on his jacket associated with
Vegapunk
's
creations
. He also possesses
lunarian
traits, such as brown skin, black wings, white hair, and white ears.
Personality
[
]

Pacifista
authority chip holder.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
S-Bear is one of the Seraphim, which Vegapunk describes as the pinnacle of his scientific achievements and the "Strongest Form of Humanity."
Physical Abilities
[
]
As a clone of
Bartholomew Kuma
, S-Bear has inherited the great physical strength and durable bodies of the extant
Buccaneers
race; a race said to carry the blood of
Giants
within them, through his
Lineage Factor
, and presumably shares all the physical advantages attributed to the race itself.
Pacifista Body
[
]
Like other Pacifista, S-Bear was given the ability to fire
lasers
from his mouth or the palms of his hands as a result of Vegapunk's research of the
Pika Pika no Mi
.
Fire Manipulation
[
]
As an artificial
lunarian
, S-Bear possesses flames on his back that are linked to his tremendous resilience as a lunarian.
With the combined durability and resilience attributed to both his Buccaneer and Lunarian
lineage factors
, in addition to the durability of being a Pacifista, S-Bear was sturdy enough to withstand a combined attack from a Gear 4 enhanced
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Rob Lucci
in his man-beast hybrid form.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Nikyu Nikyu no Mi
S-Bear's paw pads.
Via the
Green Blood
, S-Bear possesses an artificial version of the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that gives him paw pads on the palms of his hands. These paws have the power to harshly repel anything they touch, even the air itself.
Haki
[
]
S-Bear is capable of using
Observation Haki
and
Armament Haki
.
History
[
]
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
S-Bear turns on CP0.
At some point, S-Bear was taken on mission away from
Egghead
.
CP0
agents
Rob Lucci
,
Kaku
, and
Stussy
were tasked with returning him to the island, but were secretly on a mission to assassinate
Vegapunk
.
Upon being denied entry to Egghead, Lucci plotted to use S-Bear's
Nikyu Nikyu no Mi
ability to secretly infiltrate the island. Upon sending the
World Government
agents and himself to Egghead, S-Bear mobilized with CP0 while the agents began their mission.
S-Bear's group encountered
Sentomaru
who was leading
S-Shark
,
S-Snake
, and
S-Hawk
in defending the island. Kaku ordered S-Bear to take out one of the Seraphim, but Sentomaru overrode the command and had S-Bear instead attack the government agents, which it did by firing lasers.
Continuing to follow Sentomaru's order, S-Bear used an Ursus Shock against the invaders. Shortly after, Sentomaru succumbed to his injuries from CP0, resulting in the four Seraphim following CP0's command.
Upon CP0 infiltrating Egghead's Labohase while its defense system was deactivated, the four Seraphim took the initiative to follow the assassins. When they arrived, Lucci ordered them to destroy Vegapunk's laboratory before he could come out, leading to them damaging the building's structure using a range of attacks.
After Stussy subdued Kaku and Lucci, the attack command remained until
Edison
left the laboratory and ordered the Seraphim to cease their attack.
S-Bear is repeatedly attacked by Luffy & Lucci.
While Vegapunk's Satellites and the
Straw Hat Pirates
searched for the missing Stella within the Labophase, S-Bear and S-Hawk began targeting Kaku and Lucci while they were restrained and unconscious, prompting
Roronoa Zoro
to get assistance from
Monkey D. Luffy
to confront them.
Shaka
tried issuing orders, but the two Seraphim were unaffected by his commands and continued their attack.
S-Bear then  used an Ursus Shock on them, destroying a part of the lab. Luffy and Lucci then attacked S-Bear and sent him flying.
The two continued to attack him, but his recoveries persisted without issue.
S-Bear is trapped alongside his fellow Seraphim.
At some point, he and the other Seraphim were captured in
seastone
bubbles and left in the laboratory's basement with the imprisoned
Cipher pol
agents.
After
Nusjuro
cut the cloud beneath the Labophase, S-Hawk, the other Seraphim, and the imprisoned Cipher Pol agents fell to the Fabiriophase.
