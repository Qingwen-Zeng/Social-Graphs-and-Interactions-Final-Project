Biography
[

Rouge right after giving birth to Ace.
Rouge was living on
Baterilla
in
South Blue
when she was pregnant with Ace before Roger died. She was seen watching the ocean after hearing the news of Roger's execution.
She held her pregnancy for twenty months through sheer willpower in order to deceive the world of Ace's connection to the Pirate King.
When the child was finally born, Rouge held him in her arms and named him "Gol D. Ace". The result of holding Ace for so long, however, led to her death from exhaustion after giving birth.
Legacy
[
]
As a result of this sacrifice to save his life from the World Government, Ace claimed that he owed her a debt and took Portgas as his surname.
