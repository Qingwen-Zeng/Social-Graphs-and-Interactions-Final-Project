History
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
When Luffy and Zoro invaded the
Live Floor
, Queen offered a seat on the Tobiroppo for anyone who captured the pair. Tenjo-Sagari became intrigued, wanting to catch them for herself.
Tenjo-Sagari later joined
Black Maria
in the Banquet Hall, and after
Sarahebi
and another Gifter trapped
Sanji
, she kneeled down next to him holding his
wanted poster
. She put her hand on the pirate and noted his bounty before stepping away, standing at Black Maria's side while she taunted Sanji.
As Sanji tried to run away, Tenjo-Sagari and her comrades chased him and then surrounded him when he fell.
Black Maria bound Sanji to one of her webs, and Tenjo-Sagari watched as Maria battered him and demanded he call out for
Nico Robin
. He gave in and called for her help, and Robin and
Brook
arrived to free Sanji and challenge Maria and the Gifters.
Brook defeats Tenjo-Sagari and the others.
At some point in the fight, Tenjo-Sagari,
Nure-Onna
, and
Kunyun
used Maria's illusion mist to impersonate Robin's loved ones. Tenjo-Sagari took the appearance of
Clou D. Clover
, while the others appeared as
Nico Olvia
and
Jaguar D. Saul
respectively. They pretended to be excited to see Robin to trick her into falling into their trap, but Robin saw through the illusion, smacking them with
Tres Mano: Freesia
. They were confused why the illusion mist did not work, and they chased after Robin and Brook as they ran through the
Banquet Hall
. Maria intercepted them, but after Brook dispatched
Wanyudo
, Robin faced Maria alone while Brook turned to face Tenjo-Sagari and the other Gifters.
After Brook made a
wall of ice
between them and Maria, Tenjo-Sagari heard screams from the other side and, peeking through the small gap in the wall, was horrified to see Black Maria defeated with the demonic-looking Robin standing over her. Brook took the opportunity to finish off Tenjo-Sagari and Black Maria's other subordinates, with
Phrase d'armes: Orchestra
.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
"Demon Woman" as depicted in the anime.
In the anime adaptation of Tenjo-Sagari's debut in
Episode 986
, she is credited as "Demon Woman"
(
鬼女
,
Kijo
?
)
. In addition, her design differs from her later appearances and she is played by
Yūki Kaneko
rather than Momo Ishibashi, suggesting the anime interpreted her as a different character.
In the extended anime adaptation of
Episode 1020
, Tenjo-Sagari and the other subordinates of Black Maria play a game of Roller-san while kicking Sanji. They then trample on Sanji before
Sarahebi
decides to knock him out with a kick to the face, after which he woke up tied up in webs.
