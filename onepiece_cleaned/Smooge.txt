Four years ago, he was a prisoner on

before the incident involving
Vegapunk
's chemical weapon. After the incident, he lost the use of his legs due to the poisonous gas, but when Caesar Clown came to the island a year later, he was given artificial legs. Because of this, he and the other ex-prisoners gladly accepted Caesar as their master, not knowing he was the one who caused their paralysis. Later on, when
Trafalgar Law
came to the island, he was given animal legs along with the other ex-prisoners.
