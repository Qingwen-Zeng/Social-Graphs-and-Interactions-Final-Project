Otohime
's true killer and not to anyone else.

Fish-Man Island Arc

Megalo was accidentally freed from the
Surume
's grasp when
Monkey D. Luffy
attacked kraken.
After returning to Fish-Man Island, Megalo told King
Neptune
about the pirates. He later accompanied the King as he invited them to
Ryugu Palace
, apparently as an act of gratitude.
Megalo then carried Luffy and his companions as they made their way to the castle.

Later, in Princess
Shirahoshi
's room, Megalo growled at Luffy when he made Shirahoshi cry. After Luffy asked Shirahoshi about where she wanted to go, she told him that she wanted to go to the Sea Forest. Knowing that Shirahoshi's size would draw attention, Luffy decided to have Shirahoshi stuffed into Megalo. Megalo then left the room with the Princess crammed inside his mouth while Luffy stood on top of him. As he broke through the doors, he knocked out several invading pirates. Megalo coped with having the Princess stuffed inside him as he floated out of the palace and towards the
Sea Forest
.
While hovering above Coral Hill, Luffy saw Chopper, Sanji, and a bandaged Hatchan. Once Luffy jumped down to meet them, he was met with accusations from the Fish-Man Island citizens for mermaid kidnappings. Megalo finally reached his limit and spit out Shirahoshi. The Fish-Man Island citizens instantly concluded that this was a Mermaid Princess kidnapping.
The citizens then tied up Luffy and his friends, but were then interrupted by the arrival of Vander Decken IX. After Luffy pummeled Decken into the ground with only his legs, Luffy then woke up Megalo. Megalo then carried the Princess, Luffy, and his friends as they attempted to flee the scene. Decken called out to Wadatsumi to attack them, but Luffy beat back the giant with a Jet Pistol. The shark and the group then continued their path to the Sea Forest.
Megalo eventually reached the Sea Forest where the group got acquainted with Franky, Den, and
Jinbe
. Megalo then rested right next to the Thousand Sunny as Jinbe explained about letting Arlong loose into the East Blue as well as the ideals of Queen Otohime and Fisher Tiger.
After Jinbe finished explaining his story, a visual Den Den Mushi appeared and broadcasted Hody's speech to Fish-Man Island. Hody explained his plan of recreating the Ryugu Kingdom with himself as the ruler, which included executing King Neptune. After Hody finished his speech, Shirahoshi hopped onto Megalo, preparing to return to Ryugu Palace, but Jinbe stopped them. Luffy attempted to hop on Megalo, but Jinbe stopped him as well. After an argument between Jinbe and Luffy, Jinbe eventually came up with a plan.
Megalo, Shirahoshi, and Jinbe are captured by the New Fish-Man Pirates.
Megalo later carried Jinbe and Shirahoshi on his back and Luffy in his mouth, heading to Gyoncorde Plaza to save the king. Megalo, Shirahoshi, and Jinbe saw what appears to be Neptune. When they approached it, they got ensnared in a net. They were then tied up and brought to the plaza.
When Hody gloated about how he was the one behind Otohime's assassination, Shirahoshi revealed that Megalo had already told her but she chose to keep it to herself to fulfill her mother's dying wish. Hody nagged at Megalo for revealing it only to a fool and proceeded to attack Neptune.
Before he could do any fatal damage, Shirahoshi and the citizens called out for Luffy. Megalo spit out Luffy, allowing him to deal a heavy blow to Hody Jones. Megalo remained in the plaza throughout the whole battle and sat next to the Thousand Sunny during the aftermath of the battle.
Megalo was then seen pulling the Thousand Sunny (in blimp mode) away from the plaza as the Straw Hats did not want to be praised as heroes. However, a royal soldier caught up with them and Neptune invited the pirates to a banquet through a Den Den Mushi.
Megalo was then seen enjoying the banquet at Ryugu Palace. Later, he and the people of Fish-Man Island bid the Straw Hats farewell as they departed to the New World.
