History
[
]
Skypiea Arc
[
]
When the
Straw Hat Pirates
entered
Skypiea
without paying the official entry toll,
Amazon
quickly informed McKinley (as well as
God's Army
). Given a photograph of the crew, McKinley assembled a small troop to warn the residents of
Angel Island
about these new criminals, then traced them to
Conis
and
Pagaya
's home at Angel Beach.
Initially, McKinley simply ordered the Straw Hats to pay Skypiea's standard fine for toll-dodging (in their case amounting to
70,000,000,000, or
7,000,000). Tensions worsened when he noticed the
Waver
they had salvaged from the
St. Briss
, and began suspecting them of damaging and/or stealing it. When told about the fine,
Nami
immediately lost her temper and ran McKinley over with Pagaya's waver.
After he got up, he charged the Straw Hats as "Class-5" criminals, punishable by
Cloud Drifting
. Then he ordered his men to attack. The entire troop were easily beaten by
Luffy
,
Zoro
, and
Sanji
.
He was seen later watching Conis, warning the people in Skypiea to evacuate the island as soon as possible because their 'God', Enel was planning on killing them all. The citizens did not listen to Conis and a kid even threw a stone on her.
McKinley was the only one who believed her and ordered the people on the island to pack up their things immediately and leave.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Originally in the manga, McKinley's initial interactions with the Straw Hats are when he comes to deal with them are relatively short. Basically, he fines the Straw Hats, gets hit by Nami with a waver, sends his men after the Straw Hats, and then sentences them to be judged by Enel's judges. In the anime; however, the interactions are expanded on with additional scenes:
McKinley being treated by Conis.
In the anime, after he fines the Straw Hats with the first two charges of trespassing into Skypiea and having the broken waver, Usopp and the rest of the Straw Hats attempt to get on his good side by doing relatively innocent and unimportant things. However, no matter what they do, McKinley repeatedly fines them with several more charges as the things they do one after another are apparently against the law. As the number of fines are increased, Nami then comes onto the scene and hits McKinley with a waver.
Instead of being propelled into the bushes by the impact as was originally depicted by in the manga, McKinley is instead propelled into a wall and completely knocked out by Nami and is then escorted by his men to Conis' house where he receives some medical treatment. McKinley, however, sees through Conis and Pagaya's attempts to stall the White Berets and apprehends the two.
He and his men then go back down to Angel Beach where he orders them to attack the Straw Hats. He along with most of his men however are defeated by Luffy and it is then he when is sent flying off to some bushes. From there he then proceeds to sentence the Straw Hats as he normally did in the manga.
