Appearance
[
]
Shakky is a relatively slim and tall woman with short black hair, with two tufts pointing upwards and is always seen smoking a cigarette. She looks very young despite her old age.
She typically wears a pink, V-neck t-shirt that exposes her stomach and cleavage with a black spider on it beneath a black jacket with pink lines running down the sleeves that has a collar with wing-like cuffs. She also wears a yellow beaded necklace, pants that have a giraffe-like pattern, and a belt with a white cardigan tied around it. She also wears white shoes and has painted fingernails.
Twenty-two years ago, her physical features looked exactly as they do now, but with certain subtle clothing differences. She had a more revealing A-shirt with the same color and spider-motif she sports in the current storyline, but paired with short pants. She also did not wear her necklace of beads, nor her jacket.
Personality
[
]
Shakky is very knowledgeable and seems to constantly seek information - particularly on other pirates. She also reads the
newspapers
in what one could assume to be an obsessive manner, as she believes strongly that knowledge is power. She was the one who informed Luffy of all of the nine other pirates whose bounties exceed
100,000,000. She is rarely seen without a cigarette. Shakky is also highly intuitive, being able to guess Hancock's and Luffy's Impel Down penetration plan, even knowing that Hancock had fallen in love with Luffy.
She also seems intent on keeping her age a secret; Luffy asked her how old she was when he heard that she had quit being a pirate forty years ago, but she immediately changed the subject, though she mentioned that she had been chased by Luffy's grandfather. After meeting Luffy for a short time, she is impressed by him, and states that she's rooting for him to become the
Pirate King
, particularly since she is aware that
Silvers Rayleigh
was the first mate of
Gol D. Roger
and is aware that Roger and Luffy are similar.
Shakky is also fond of teasing people, like teasing Chopper into believing he had to pay
100,000 for cotton candy.
She is infamous for charging exorbitant prices for her goods, but she made an exception for
Hatchan
and the
Straw Hats
. She also appreciates those who know when not to fight, which is why she favours Luffy over
Eustass Kid
, who tends to attack anyone, even innocent civilians over petty reasons despite the fact that his bounty was higher.
Relationships
[

Rayleigh
[
]
Rayleigh
is Shakky's business partner and husband. When he had gone missing for the previous six months before her introduction, she was not worried because she knew what Rayleigh is capable of. Shakky guessed that the Straw Hats might be able to find Rayleigh at
Sabaody Park
. After the
Straw Hat Pirates
returned from the
Human Auctioning House
, where they found Rayleigh, he and the entire Straw Hat crew gathered at Shakky's bar. Rayleigh trusts her implicitly and he knows her qualities. With her deductions, Rayleigh managed to find Luffy after the war.

Bartholomew Kuma
teleported
the Straw Hats away from Sabaody Archipelago to different locations. As time passed and the Straw Hats had not been heard from since they were last seen, Camie began to worry about their safety. While Pappag and Hatchan were convinced they would be fine, Shakuyaku on the contrary, pointed out that their chances of facing a
Marine
Admiral
and escaping are slim, and noted that the current era is slowly changing, so the Straw Hats must catch and hold on to "the waves" that will inevitably wash it away to survive.
