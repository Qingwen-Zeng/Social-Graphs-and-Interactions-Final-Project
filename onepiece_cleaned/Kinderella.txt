Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Her name is a portmanteau of the fairy-tale character
Cinderella
and the Japanese term for
gold
(
金
,
Kin
?
)
, reflecting her
"gold-digging"
character. This is confirmed by her signature laugh, derived from a popular Japanese shorthand for
marrying into money
(
玉の輿
,
Tama no koshi
?
, lit. "jeweled palanquin")
.
The
VIZ manga
translates her laugh as
"Gold-dig-dig-dig-dig."
