Appearance
[
]
Kuroobi has the typical appearance of a martial artist with a dark blue
gi
and a black belt. His hair is tied into a straight ponytail. His
Sun Pirates
tattoo is on the right side of his chest.
Whether this tattoo covers a slave mark is currently unknown.
Fifteen years ago, when he was part of the Sun Pirates, his hair was afro-like.
Personality
[
]
Kuroobi is one of the strictest members in his crew and has always been wary of
Nami
's supposed allegiance to Arlong. Kuroobi’s attitude is similar to his captain, as he loathes all humans, but does not share Arlong's care for Nami as he dislikes and distrusts the navigator. He even searched her room for evidence he could use against her.
Kuroobi does have respect for other people's strength, as seen with Arlong. Though he did complement Sanji's strength by saying he is above the "average human", he still mocked the cook for throwing his life away for one girl. Kuroobi is very cruel and unforgiving, as he sliced up Genzo for protecting Bell-mere for trying to rescue Nami, and later he mocked Sanji, saying he was too "weak" to protect Nami and his friends (though Sanji proved this wrong by defeating him).
Kuroobi will take every advantage he can get in battle. During the Arlong Park battle, he punched Sanji through a wall when the latter was not focusing on the fight and tried to attack a weakened
Zoro
from behind. Kuroobi took advantage of Sanji’s attempt to save Luffy by diving into the sea and promptly tortured the cook underwater due to his fish-man-enhanced ability while submerged. When Sanji turned the battle around by beating the karate fish-man to a pulp, Kuroobi was so furious he could not see straight, cursing the cook before being taken out.
Like many other characters he has a
unique laugh
: "Kuhahahahaha"

Fish-Man Karate
to fight his opponents. He is a level 40 black belt practitioner of this martial art, causing great injury to Sanji in their battle. As a fish-man, Kuroobi has an advantage underwater. Kuroobi states his ultimate technique is Senmaigawara Seiken but it is unknown actually how strong this punch is, as Sanji beat Kuroobi into submission before Kuroobi actually executed the move.

History
[

Past
[
]
As a youth, Kuroobi was with
Hatchan
,
Arlong
,and
Chew
, when they saw the
Sabaody Ferris Wheel
admiring it.
Kuroobi and Hatchan planned to open a takoyaki store when they were younger.
At some point, they had given up this dream to become members of the
Arlong Pirates
. After
Fisher Tiger
attacked Mary Geoise and formed the
Sun Pirates
, the Arlong Pirates integrated with Tiger's crew. During their time roaming the Grand Line, the Sun Pirates battled numerous Marines. One day, a former human slave named Koala boarded their ship to return to her home in Foolshout Island. After returning her to her home, the Sun Pirates were ambushed by the Marines. They lost their ship and Tiger was badly wounded during the battle. Tiger soon died from his wounds and Arlong was later captured. Kuroobi was then under the command of Jinbe. Eventually, Jinbe received an invitation to join the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
. After Jinbe accepted the position, Arlong was released.
Kuroobi wounds Genzo.
When the Sun Pirates split up, Kuroobi went with Arlong's crew. The Arlong Pirates then headed for East Blue. At the arrival of the Arlong Pirates to Conomi Island, Kuroobi was following the orders of his captain by wreaking havoc on the island and raiding its towns. The Arlong Pirates then took over Nami's village, killing Bell-mère in the process. During the raid in Nami's house, he was the one who cut Genzo, giving him his scars.
East Blue Saga
[

Arlong Park Arc
[
]
The Arlong Pirates briefly had Zoro imprisoned until Nami freed him when they were not looking. After
Chew
dragged Usopp to Arlong Park, Kuroobi questioned Nami's loyalty. Showing everybody a
map
to the village from her room, Nami was angry that he took her belongings. After Nami supposedly stabbed Usopp and pushed him into the pool where they thought he drowned, Kuroobi apologized to Nami for doubting her.
As one of Arlong's officers, Kuroobi aided Chew and Hatchan in defeating the contingent of Marines from the 77th Branch.
Kuroobi is kicked by Sanji.
During the battle with the
Straw Hat Pirates
at Arlong Park, Kuroobi fought against
Sanji
.
After a strong blow from Kuroobi that he announced was
Fish-Man Karate
, Sanji could only smirk and laugh. He told Kuroobi his attacks were nothing compared to
Zeff
's kicks.
Kuroobi nearly defeated him when the cook headed underwater to save
Luffy
. During the battle, Kuroobi taunted Sanji about his chivalry, saying he would not be able to protect his "girlfriend" (Nami) and rest of his friends, and stated to the drowning Sanji that he would kill all of them. Sanji managed to force Kuroobi up to dry land by blowing air into his gills.
Once out of water, Kuroobi was confident he could still beat Sanji even on land. Enraged by the taunts, Sanji promptly beat Kuroobi into submission with his kicks, not giving the fish-man any time to counter attack. Ultimately, Sanji kicked Kuroobi into and through Arlong Park, where he laid defeated on the other side of the building.
Kuroobi was later arrested along with the entire crew, though his fellow crew member Hatchan later escaped.
