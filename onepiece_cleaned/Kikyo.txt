History

Summit War Saga
[

Amazon Lily Arc
[
]
On
Amazon Lily
, Kikyo watched as
Marguerite
and
Sweet Pea
removed the
Body Mushrooms
from
Monkey D. Luffy
's body. A large group of
Kuja
gathered at the river to watch Luffy's body getting washed. When
Elder Nyon
revealed that Luffy is a man, all the Kuja including Kikyo were shocked,
and Luffy was imprisoned.
When Luffy later awoke, a group of Kuja gathered around his cell and began observing him. His arm
stretches
when he steals back his
straw hat
from Sweet Pea. Kikyo was unpetrubed by this, while most of the group fell back in shock. After Luffy angrily shouted at Marguerite for adding frills to his clothes, Kikyo and the other Kuja prepared to attack with their
snake bows and arrows
. Regardless of Luffy's apology, Kikyo insisted that he must be eliminated, and pointed out that Marguerite, Sweet Pea, and
Aphelandra
would be punished if
Boa Hancock
found out about a man on the island. The Kuja unleashed their arrows, but Luffy managed to escape through the roof. As he escaped, Luffy grabbed Marguerite and then headed to the forest. Soon after, the
Perfume Yuda
was spotted nearing the island, so Kikyo lead a group of Kuja to eliminate Luffy and rescue Marguerite.
Kikyo and the others later caught up with Luffy and Marguerite,
but Luffy escaped again. Marguerite mentioned that he was looking for a
ship
, so they quickly headed back to the city.
By the time they returned, Luffy had already been captured.
At the arena, Kikyo watched Luffy getting interrogated by Boa Hancock. She became worried when Marguerite, Sweet Pea, and Aphelandra took the blame for Luffy's presence and were turned to stone by Hancock's
Mero Mero no Mi
powers. Kikyo then watched as Luffy fought and defeated
Bacura
.
Before he fought the
Gorgon Sisters
,
Boa Marigold
and
Sandersonia
, Luffy the three petrified women, which confused Kikyo.
During the fight, Kikyo panicked when Boa Sandersonia was about to crush Marguerite. Luffy unleashed
Supreme King Haki
to save Marguerite, and Kikyo was stunned to see Luffy had such an ability.
After Marigold's fire burned away Sandersonia's clothes, Luffy covered her back while the spectators were evacuated from the arena.
Afterwards, Kikyo was happy to see Marguerite, Sweet Pea, and Aphelandra had been returned to normal.
That night, the Kuja and Luffy had a party. Kikyo was unamused by Luffy's antics.
The next morning, the
Kuja Pirates
sailed off with Luffy. Kikyo and the others bid them farewell, and Kikyo yelled at the Kuja who put sticks in their mouths and noses.
Post-War Arc
[
]
After Luffy was brought back to Amazon Lily to recover from the
Summit War of Marineford
, Kikyo and the others discussed his return to the island.
Anime and Manga Differences

]
In the anime, Kikyo and her fellow
Kuja
,
Aphelandra
,
Marguerite
, and
Sweet Pea
have a brief interaction with the
Heart Pirates
and provide them
food
while the men are treating a wounded
Luffy
. Kikyo strictly informs her fellow Kuja to not communicate with the
pirates
.
In the manga, she was not seen as a
Kuja Pirate
before and after the timeskip, but she was seen in the crew in the anime.
