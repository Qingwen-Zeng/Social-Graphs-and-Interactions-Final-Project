"Loan Shark" Galdino
,
alias
Mr. 3
,
is a former
officer agent
of
Baroque Works
, alongside his partner
Miss Goldenweek
.
He was the main antagonist of the
Little Garden Arc
, and one of the central characters from
Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
, along with the rest of
Baroque Works
Officer Agents.
After being sent to
Impel Down
, he escaped with the assistance of
Buggy
and
Monkey D. Luffy
, being one of Luffy's main allies during the
Impel Down Arc
and later during the
Marineford Arc
. When the
war
ended, he became a member of the
Buggy and Alvida Alliance
.
After Buggy became a
Warlord of the Sea
, the alliance evolved into the
Underworld
organization known as
Buggy's Delivery
. The organization was integrated into a larger one,
Cross Guild
, of which he is currently a member.
Appearance
[
]
When he first appeared, Galdino was an average-sized man with a rather frail-looking build. Like other male Baroque Works agents, Mr. 3 has his number hidden somewhere on his costume. For Mr. 3, he has 3's visible on his vest design, upper part of his glasses, and one big 3 achieved through his top knot. He also wears glasses and has neatly combed hair. He was also seen wearing a
Log Pose
on his left wrist. As a small form of comic relief, his hair seems to form various shapes according to the situation (like an "!" when he got scared or a "?" when he heard about Luffy for the first time and asked who Luffy was during the Little Garden arc, and even an arrow pointing to where he was talking about during the Impel Down Arc).
Later, like most
Impel Down
prisoners, he wears a striped prisoner's outfit, with his top knot sagging and his right lens of his glasses cracked. His hair became untidy, and he grew a beard due to the roughness of the Beast Hell he was placed in.
After the escape, he changed to a black pair of pants, and adorned a cloak over his attire. In an attempt to save Ace, Galdino disguised himself as an executioner, and somehow made himself look slightly more muscular.
After the war he trimmed his hair back to its original length but kept his beard. He is also seen wearing a orange button collar shirt and brown pants.
When Galdino uses his
Candle Champion
technique, he gains an incredible change in size. The suit is white; however, with Miss Goldenweek's painting abilities, the suit could be colored, as shown during the Little Garden Arc.
After the time-skip, not much has changed about Galdino except that he has grown a full mustache. He also currently wears a white shirt with suspenders and a red bowtie.

Personality
[
]
Galdino thinks very highly of himself, and is not afraid to show it. He believes himself to be a master of strategy, using his intellect and total lack of scruples to complete his plans. This statement is at least partly true, since
Crocodile
himself admitted that although
Mr. 4
and
Miss Merry Christmas
were stronger than Galdino, he had been assigned a higher rank due to his intelligence.
He also thinks of himself as a great artist, using his wax powers to turn his victims into "living statues" for his former partner,
Miss Goldenweek
, to paint over.
However, when presented with situations in which he has to fight for his life, he reveals himself as little more than a coward who fears fighting (such as when a rage-filled
Brogy
was close to completely shattering his wax bonds).
He is also somewhat sadistic, as he prefers killing people after making them perfect human sculptures in a long and painful process, rather than killing them directly. During his fights, he prefers to prevent opponents from attacking him by trapping their body parts with his Devil Fruit.
Galdino also likes tea, especially Earl Grey.
However, he apparently had some unexpected changes while in Impel Down. While he was a coward before, Galdino risked his life to repay a debt to Luffy by blocking a torrent of deadly poison. He also admits that if he is not careful, he could end up viewing Luffy as a friend. After Bentham sacrificed himself to save the escapees, he was clearly very upset and admitted that he did not think Bentham was really all that bad. This eventually results in Galdino attempting to free Ace on his own accord, stating that he wants to avenge his fallen comrade and fulfill Bentham's last wish, risking his life for a second time in doing so.
Like many other characters, Galdino has a distinct speech style. He tends to end his sentences in "gane", for example: "omae mo-gane" (you too gane) or "warau-gane" (laugh-gane). Like many catchphrases in the series, it has no actual meaning other than a distinct way of talking.
Relationships
[
]
Baroque Works
[
]
He and his partner,
Miss Goldenweek
, had a relationship standard of most Baroque Works pairs. While he greatly appreciated her help with her painting skills, he would also grow annoyed from time to time when she would easily give away information. She would also paint his wax sculptures for him.
He thought lowly of those who were beneath him in rank. He openly showed distaste for
Mr. 5
upon learning of his defeat in
Whisky Peak
. He saw Mr. 5 as a fool who relied more on the power of his Devil Fruit and should have been more tactful. He also wished for the downfall of those above him in rank as well so as to benefit him with a promotion, making him antagonistic to the other
Officer Agents
.
Though he is a loyal subject to
Crocodile
, Mr. 3 began to and fear him after Crocodile attempted to murder him by feeding him to the
Bananawani
. Ever since, the mere sight of Crocodile fills him with terror. However, after the time skip when
Crocodile
formed the
Cross Guild
Galdino was overjoyed to be working for him again, albeit with some retaining fear.
While initially viewing
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
as an idiotic nuisance, the
Okama
's actions in Impel Down deeply moved Mr. 3; he felt that his actions in Marineford helped avenge, as he put it, his "fallen friend".
Buggy
[
]
Galdino and Buggy team up to escape Impel Down.
Galdino and
Buggy
teamed up in Impel Down in order to escape the Great Prison, and, sharing a hatred for Luffy, quickly became friends. However, they usually found that their attempts to escape without the assistance of Luffy and his allies proved fruitless, and it was only through Luffy's help that they managed to break free.
During their time side by side in Impel Down, Galdino acted as the more cautious of the two, frequently warning Buggy of the dangers that the two of them have triggered throughout the course of their escape from the prison. In the anime, he has, on more than one occasion, had to do things himself to ensure Buggy's safety as well as his own, using his wax to supply themselves with convenient implements to protect their lives with.
After the breakout, Galdino was deeply shocked to learn that Buggy was once a member of the
Roger Pirates
and was good friends with
Shanks
, making him questioned Buggy's cowardly nature. After Buggy gains his blindly loyal followers, Galdino remains the only one who can see through Buggy's courageous façade and wonders how far he can take it.
After the Summit War of Marineford, Galdino stayed with Buggy and joined his crew along with the other escaped Impel Down inmates. Though his exact position within the crew is unknown, he appears to be one of the high-ranking members given his friendship with Buggy and the fact that he is seen eating with the other high-ranking members of the crew (Mohji, Richie, Cabaji, and Alvida). Presumably, he was pardoned like the other Impel Down escapees that joined Buggy's crew, due to Buggy becoming a
Warlord of the Sea
. This also makes him a member of
Buggy's Delivery
, the pirate mercenary group founded by Buggy.
However, he stated he had never officially joined Buggy's crew and was more than willing to work for his original boss, even mocking Buggy while he was at it.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Mr. 3 was initially antagonistic to Luffy, after ambushing his new giant friend
Dorry
and causing him to almost die. Mr. 3 scoffed at Luffy's approach of following blind instinct but was nonetheless defeated by that very same instinct.
The two met up again in Impel Down, where Galdino seemed to forgive Luffy for his past actions against him. While initially showing cowardice in the walls of Impel Down, Luffy's actions helped motivate Galdino to become more active in freeing all of the escapees from the Great Prison, a task that would have been impossible without him and his wax. He assisted Luffy in holding off
Magellan
long enough for
Jinbe
,
Mr. 1
,
Crocodile
, and
Buggy
to abscond with a ship.
He was later shocked to hear about
Luffy's heritage
but played a pivotal role in helping Luffy free his brother during the
Summit War of Marineford
. After Luffy's key had been broken by
Kizaru
, Galdino crafted a new key made of wax, and it was that act that finally freed Ace from his shackles.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Prior to the fall of Baroque Works, Mr. 3 was amongst the top-ranked members of the criminal organization, and presumably had a number of
Billions
(the lower ranked subordinates of Baroque Works
Officer Agents
) under his command.
He is also highly artistic and detailed, capable of perfectly replicating the physical structure of a human being with just a visual in mind.
Crocodile only allowed Mr. 3 to hold his position in the organization as "Mr. 3" because
Mr. 4
was too mentally slow. Otherwise, he would have been ranked lower. In Impel Down, he proves his overall lack of fighting spirit on a number of occasions; this was further proven when he fainted under Luffy's burst of
Haki
, though he did wake up for some time after that on his own. He acted like a coward and backed up Buggy's escape plan rather than Luffy's much more dangerous advancement to the lower levels. After Magellan had shown up on the fleeing group during their escape, Galdino showed a moment of bravery, but he admitted he could only hold it together for a brief moment.
In spite of his cowardice, Galdino seems to have some skill in stealth and infiltration.
Master Tactician
[
]
Galdino's tactical intellect is his greatest asset, opportunistic by nature, Galdino prefer to use cunning wits to outsmart and defeat enemies, this was shown when he manipulated everlasting battle between the giants Dorry and Brogy so as to obtain at least one
100,000,000 bounty without the need to engage in any physical combat.
He is very observant with a strong sense of danger as he noticed something was amiss in Impel Down's Level 4, after he and Buggy accidentally ended up in Level 4 with Bentham and Luffy. He noticed the guards were moving in formations and that no one was feeding the fires nor were any of the prisoners trying to escape. As a result, he cautioned Buggy on following Bentham and Straw Hat to the Kitchen, fearing the possibility of a trap and told Buggy they had to check the exits, suspecting the possibility of Warden Magellan appearing to restore order to the prison and capture Luffy which is proven when Magellan personally appeared to stop Luffy.
While working together, he and Buggy were able to bypass many of Impel Down's surveillance systems after abandoning Bentham in Level 5. This was further elaborated during the Marineford Arc, where he demonstrated being clever enough to avoid Aokiji's
freezing
powers by substituting himself with one of his wax statues without the admiral noticing, and then later succeeding at impersonating one of Ace's executioners in his secret attempt to free the 2nd Division Commander.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Doru Doru no Mi
Galdino ate the Doru Doru no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
which allows him to create and control candle wax.
He can manipulate this wax into any shape he desires, change it between solid and liquid states, and control its motion in both liquid and hardened states. The wax is noted to be stronger than steel while it is solid. Interestingly, as a "Candle Man", he produces flames from his hair while using his powers.
He is able to craft various weapons, tools, and other constructs out of wax; he can attack his opponents with wax swords and spears, bind his opponents in globs of wax that he hardens on contact with the victim, and protect himself with wax walls and hide among a collection of wax clones. He can even create a wax mech suit for himself and form buildings out of wax that he and his allies can use as a home base/protective fortress. He can also use his wax to create keys that he can use to unlock cages and shackles.
Galdino's wax is an excellent defense against poison and is resilient against digestive acid. Attributes that he used to overcome dangerous situations, such as protecting himself and the other prisoners in
Impel Down
from
Magellans
poison
, and when
Crocodile
fed his to a giant gator.
His wax can be quickly melted by high heat and fire.

Creating keys is one of the most useful abilities granted by the fruit's power.
Ship
[
]
Further information:
Chiryaku Ten'nen Maru
The ship that Mr. 3 used when he was a Baroque Work agent.
Mr. 3 owned a personal
ship
during his career in Baroque Works. He used this ship to arrive discreetly to
Arabasta
and to escape
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
's vigilance. It's a small boat with 3 as a figurehead. It also has the
Baroque Works
Jolly Roger
as the flag.
Nefertari Vivi
mentioned that it is powered by his
Doru Doru no Mi
powers,
although the exact method has yet to be explained. It likely functions similarly to
Smoker
's
Billower Bike
in that his wax flows around an axle to rotate the paddles.
It first appeared in
Chapter 158
and
Episode 93
,
and was later seen in the
Baroque Works Mini-Series
.
What happened to it after Mr. 3 was arrested and sent to
Impel Down
is unknown, but it is unlikely that he is still using it, as he is now onboard
Big Top
.
History

Past
[

Galdino's past remains unknown. However, at some point he ate the
Doru Doru no Mi
and he joined the
Baroque Works
. He also once took down a criminal with a
42,000,000 bounty.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Little Garden Arc
[
]
While on
Kyuka Island
, Mr. 3 was enjoying his vacation break when his partner,
Miss Goldenweek
, complained that she was bored. He then told her to just enjoy her break and asked that she refrain from referring to him by his codename in public. Afterwards, he noticed that she had been staring at a piece of paper and asked her what she was doing. She replied that she was staring at the orders they had received from their boss a few days earlier. Mr. 3 then erupts into anger that Miss Goldenweek had not informed him of their new orders, which were to search out the
Straw Hat Pirates
who had beaten
Mr. 5
.
Mr. 3 meets up with Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine.
Some time later, the duo arrived at
Little Garden
. Mr. 5 and
Miss Valentine
then arrived on the island and entered Mr. 3's wax house. Inside the hideout, Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek had been expecting the two while drinking tea. Mr. 3 mocked his fellow officer agents for their failure to kill Vivi, putting their organization in danger. As a second chance, he offered them to complete a job or to be killed by him. Besides killing the Straw Hats, the job consisted of capturing the two giants,
Dorry
and
Brogy
. The bounties they had before starting their fight a hundred years ago were still valid and capturing them would allow them to collect a
200,000,000 bounty. It was revealed that in order to accomplish their plan, Mr. 3 had ordered Mr. 5 to place a bomb in the rum that Dorry and
Monkey D. Luffy
were drinking.
. Elsewhere,
Zoro
realized that he was lost, when he spotted what appeared to be
Nami
; however, meanwhile, the real Nami and
Usopp
had been running from a dinosaur when she spotted what appeared to be Luffy.
After defeating Dorry, Brogy was ecstatic, though Luffy, knowing that the duel was rigged, was angry and demanded to know who the real culprit was. Mr. 3 then revealed himself to Brogy and asked why he was crying, to which Brogy demanded to know who he was, which prompted Mr. 3 to introduce himself and exclaimed that the giant had already been captured. When Brogy moved to take a step forward, it was revealed that he had been immobilized by wax. Meanwhile, back at Dorry's camp, Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine showed up and Luffy realized it was them that they had planted the bomb. They also revealed that they had captured
Karoo
and intended to use him to separate Vivi from Luffy. Angered by their lack of morals, Vivi and Usopp attacked the duo, only to be defeated easily.In the meantime, Mr. 3 had completely defeated Brogy and announced that he would make a masterpiece out of him.
Mr. 3 then told Brogy how he had helped him out during his fight with Dorry by using explosives, of which angered Brogy. Vivi was then delivered to Mr. 3, at which point she insulted him for his crude ways and sabotaging the fight. He then began to make a giant candle to wax his captives. Brogy then stated that at the beginning of the fight he knew something was wrong, and at that point, he attempted to attack Mr. 3, only to be taken out by Mr. 5's bomb attack.
Mr. 3's art work.
While Brogy tried to get back up, Mr. 3 realized he needed to use more force to keep him down and he stabbed him with wax swords in his hands and his feet, immobilizing him completely. He then increased the speed of his candle technique and he explained that the Straw Hats would be turned into a group of wax statues, preserving the look of horror on their faces forever. Brogy then tried to get up once more but failed, and Zoro, inspired by his attempt, resolved to cut off his own legs to escape, and his resolve inspired Brogy to try one last time to get up. Fortunately Luffy, Karoo and Usopp arrived before they went through with it and vow to defeat the Baroque Works' agents, with Zoro asking Luffy to destroy the candle to which he agreed, but Mr. 3 saying that he would not let him.
Zoro switched his pose to one more awesome, just in case he got turned into wax, and Miss Goldenweek pointed out to Mr. 3 that the prisoners were not showing fear, which annoyed him. Luffy then prepared to fight, to which Mr. 3 accepted his challenge. Luffy then started attacking but he was quickly caught in a candle lock, but he used it to his advantage by making it into a hammer technique which he used to destroy the candle. However, this did not stop the waxing process and Mr. 3 continued his attack, but Usopp interrupted with an explosive bullet, but it was eaten by Mr. 5. Luffy continued his assault but Mr. 3 also continued his attacks as well, though Luffy beat him. But then he became strangely uncooperative as Miss Goldenweek activated her "color trap".
Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine explain that Luffy is under the spell of "color trap". Vivi then tricked Luffy into getting out of the trap which returned Luffy to normal, unfortunately he then got caught in another of Miss Goldenweek's traps, while Nami, Zoro and Vivi looked on in horror of their impeding doom. Meanwhile Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine were still chasing Usopp and Karoo, who freed Luffy from his trap but he was once again unable to combat Miss Goldenweeks' abilities. As the fight between the two duos continued, Mr. 5 realized that he was not fast enough to catch Usopp and Karoo, while Usopp headed back to the candle and found his friends waxed. Usopp then fired at Luffy destroying his shirt and freeing him from color trap once again, but he was promptly shot by Mr. 5, which angered Luffy declaring that he would defeat them.
Mr. 3's Candle Champion.
Mr. 3 unveiled his Candle Champion technique to fight against Luffy, which Luffy found cool. He then started attacking Mr. 3, though his candle champion technique proved a formidable match, while Usopp realized a way to free his friends and he tried to free them, but he was stopped by Mr. 5 who bombarded him. He gave Karoo a piece of rope and some instructions, but he was overheard by Miss Valentine who then began by testing how much weight he could take. Luffy suddenly grabbed Mr. 3's hair and used his hair to light Karoo's rope, which was covered in oil, on fire.
Luffy defeats Mr. 3 after finding him among his wax copies.
The fire from Mr. 3's hair ignited the oil covered rope and creates a furnace, freeing the waxed Zoro, Vivi, Brogy, and Nami. Mr. 3 began to run away to which Luffy ran after him. Meanwhile, the other agents were defeated. Luffy was angry at Mr. 3 for destroying the pride of the giants' battle, and finally came across a multitude of Mr. 3's, but Luffy used his instincts and picked out the real Mr. 3, beating him once and for all.
At Mr. 3's wax house Sanji had a phone call with
Mr. 0
and he pretended to be Mr. 3. He informed Mr. 0 that he had killed Vivi and the Straw Hats much to the pleasure of Mr. 0 who informed Sanji that the
Unluc
kies
will be at Little Garden shortly to deliver him an eternal log pose to Arabasta. The Unluckies then arrived and attack Sanji who quickly defeated them, and told Mr. 0 that one of the Straw Hats was still alive but that he finished them. This angered Mr. 0 and he hung up, and he then informed Miss All Sunday to send
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
to Little Garden to assassinate Mr. 3 for giving him a false report.
Arabasta Arc
[
]
He later showed up in
Arabasta
and had arrived at
Spiders Cafe
to group up with his fellow officer agents. However, instead of revealing himself, he hitched a ride behind
Banchi
's carriage and went along with them to the Baroque Works hideout.
Crocodile attacks Mr. 3.
After Crocodile revealed
Operation Utopia
to the officer agents gathered, Mr. 3 came out of hiding and interrupted the meeting. Crocodile then allowed him to speak and so, Mr. 3 asked for a second chance after failing to carry out his orders. Upon hearing this, Crocodile questioned him about what he meant, to which Mr. 3 then revealed that Vivi and the Straw Hats were still alive. Upon seeing Crocodile's anger, Mr. 3 tried to explain that the intelligence he was given was wrong. Mr. 3 then asks for a second chance at killing them, but before he could continue speaking, Crocodile grabbed him by the neck and sucked the moisture out of him. Afterwards, Crocodile opened a trap door and dropped Mr. 3 into the tank of
Bananawanis
for their meal. In the tank, Mr. 3 looked around and wondered he had fallen. He then noticed the Bananawani approaching him.
Later, when
Sanji
kicked a Bananawani to save his crew and retrieve the key to their cage from inside its stomach. From inside the Bananawani, however, out came a ball of wax, which is revealed to have been created by Mr. 3's powers to encapsulate himself in wax while in the gator's stomach. Upon escaping, Mr. 3 quickly drank some of the water leaking everywhere to hydrate himself. Then, Sanji demanded that Mr. 3 hand over the key to the cage, but instead, Mr. 3 threw the key. Upon being alerted by Usopp of Mr. 3's abilities, Sanji forced Mr. 3 to make a wax key. Sanji then knocked Mr. 3 unconscious. When Crocodile returned, he saw Mr. 3's body floating around in the water.
Miraculously, Mr. 3 managed to escape Crocodile's wrath a second time; though he stayed in Arabasta for at least several more days, he took no part in
Operation Utopia
, and became one of the few Officer Agents to not be exposed and arrested upon Baroque Works' defeat. After the Arabasta civil war officially ended and the Straw Hats left the kingdom, he mixed in among hundreds of civilians in
Rainbase
, listening to the
Den Den Mushi
relaying Vivi's coming-of-age speech.
Water 7 Saga
[

Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
[
]
Galdino is arrested with the other "top men" of the former Baroque Works.
Eventually, Galdino returned to
Kyuka Island
, and for a time managed to avoid the many
Marines
pursuing Baroque Works fugitives. Unfortunately, the island came to the attention of
"Black Cage" Hina
, as well as a haphazard rescue-party consisting of the former
Miss Goldenweek
,
Mr. 5
, and
Miss Valentine
. In no time, Hina captured  Miss Valentine, and threatened to execute her unless the remaining fugitives—including Galdino—surrendered.
Unsympathetic to his ex-associates, Galdino almost immediately tried to flee the island.
As he prepared to launch
his ship
, however, he was stopped by one more fugitive: the former
Mr. 2
.
Out of loyalty and sentimentality, Mr. 2 subdued Galdino, and
"borrowed" his face
(as well as clothing) to stage a faux-surrender to Hina.
This gambit enabled Miss Goldenweek and Mr. 5 to rescue Miss Valentine (and, ultimately, most of the imprisoned Officer Agents), but cost Mr. 2 and Galdino their own freedom, as both were arrested by the Marines and sent to
Impel Down
with Crocodile and the former
Mr. 1
.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Impel Down Arc
[
]
Galdino offers his assistance at escaping.
Galdino was revealed to have been residing in Level 2 of Impel Down, appearing more ragged and with facial hair than he had prior to his sentencing, and apparently given up on hope of surviving within his confines.
When Luffy and
Buggy
entered Level 2 and defeated the
Basilisk
, Buggy decided to release the prisoners in order to cause a riot. Galdino saw his chance and went out, where he addressed them and said that he would repay the debt for letting him out by helping them to Level 3. However, once he heard that Luffy was intending to go down instead of up to Level 1, he attempted to back out of the deal, but reconsidered once he realized that the Level 3 stairwell would also lead back up to Level 1.
He then conspired with Buggy to ditch Luffy so they could escape, but a
Sphinx
blocked their way to freedom. In order to ensure that he wasn't crushed by the Sphinx, he created lots of wax copies of himself in order to trick the Sphinx, but this only resulted in the Sphinx destroying the floor, sending Galdino, Buggy, Luffy and the Sphinx plummeting straight into Level 3.
With the Sphinx knocked out, Galdino explains that Level 3 is known as the "Starvation Hell", where the heat from Level 4 is so hot that it even reaches the one above, and the prisoners are forced to starve. Before they could go anywhere, they were captured in a
Seastone
-reinforced net. The guard and commander of the
Blue Gorillas
:
Saldeath
, says there is no escape, but the Sphinx, who was also captured along with the three, broke out of the net, releasing them. Galdino and Buggy climbed up and told Luffy they are ditching him to break out of prison, but Luffy gives his thanks anyway. Upon trying to find a way out, Galdino and Buggy came across
Bentham
's cell, who shocked to see Galdino out of his. An embarrassed Galdino suggests that they do not let him out.
Later Galdino and Buggy are mentioned to be in Level 2, but as
Minotaurus
landed on top of them because Luffy sent it flying, both of them had no other choice than to run. Minotaurus chased Galdino and Buggy down to Level 3 until they meet up with Luffy and Bentham. After all four of them joined up, they attacked the Minotaurus one after the other. Galdino contributed to the defeat of Minotaurus as he used his Devil Fruit powers to wax Luffy's arm so that the final blow by Luffy finished the Jailer Beast, Minotaurus, off. Only shortly after that, they realized that they were falling into the boiling point of Level 4. To their fortune, they could jump off the falling debris to land safely.
When Luffy began to run in a random direction, Galdino along with Buggy and Bentham followed him as Bentham told them that there is a kitchen stuffed with food. However, as Galdino and Buggy realized that there were many guards running around in order to get Luffy, they changed their mind and made up an idea to escape from Level 4. As Galdino then saw Luffy being attacked by
Magellan
, he could only think of getting back to Level 3 by taking down
Hannyabal
. Galdino and Buggy assumed that Hannyabal would be weak as he does not seem to possess a Devil Fruit, and Buggy's Muggy Balls would also be of great advantage for them. They decided to make their way to the entrance to Level 3 from Level 4.
Unfortunately, they underestimated Hannyabal severely, who easily defeated them both. They were rescued by Bentham, who was disguised as Hannyabal, and he told them they needed to save Luffy, who was defeated by Magellan and taken to Level 5. Galdino is afterwards seen with Buggy and a disguised Bentham traveling down to Level 5, the Freezing Hell. However, the three of them were shocked to learn that the prisoners and a supposed Hannyabal have to discard their cloaks. As soon as they entered, they saw the
Wolf Unit
intent to eat them. With Bentham prepared to face them, he is shown sprinting away in horror with Buggy.
Galdino and Buggy start a riot.
He is later shown alongside Buggy hiding on Level 2 using his Doru Doru powers and then making wax keys and freeing prisoners in order to cause a distraction for them to leave. Unfortunately, Magellan came to Level 2 and killed many of the rioters. He also sealed off all the entrances and exits to the level, causing Galdino to worry. Luckily,
Blackbeard
reopened the level and Galdino and the rioters prepared to head to Level 1. However, before they could escape out of Level 1, they were attacked by the revived Jailer Beasts, but thanks to the arrival of Luffy,
Jinbe
and
Crocodile
's group, the Jailer Beasts were quickly subdued again.
Galdino uses Candle Wall to stop Magellan's Hydra.
Magellan quickly arrived to try to kill the group, but Galdino in a surprising move, blocked the Chief Warden's Hydra with his own Candle Wall, urging Luffy and company to escape, stating that he'd be damned if he had to keep being in Luffy's debt. As it was clear that Galdino could not actually defeat Magellan, he planned to escape, but Luffy stayed behind to back him up. Noticing his wax's defensive capabilities against Magellan's poison, Luffy asked and received a set of wax boxing gloves and boots, which he promptly used to injure Magellan.
Galdino helps Luffy fight Magellan.
Galdino continued to hold down the fort against Magellan by creating wax barricades around some cannons until they were forced to flee from Magellan's poison golem. Galdino managed to make it out of Impel Down and onto the group's escape ship, upon which he collapsed and gave thanks to above. When Bentham sacrificed himself to enable the others' escape, Galdino was visibly stunned. He is later seen actually crying over Bentham's sacrifice and admits that he no longer actually had hard feelings towards him.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Later, the Marines called the escape ship and revealed that
Buggy
was once part of the Pirate King's crew and is good friends with
Shanks
. Galdino wondered why Buggy is such a coward, if all that is true. When
Luffy
and the others reached the
Gates of Justice
, Galdino was seen to be very excited.
He was later seen alongside with the other Impel Down fugitives, falling from the sky to Marineford, in order to support Luffy in
Ace
's rescue. He was also seen wearing a cloak and black pants over his original prisoner's striped shirt, understandably hysterical.
Galdino protects Ace using his Candle Wall.
When Buggy showed his shock at
Kizaru
's
laser attack
, then tried to hide it (of which most prisoners bought), Galdino cried out that they are so full of hope that they are half deaf. When
Sengoku
announced that Luffy's father is none other than
Dragon
the
Revolutionary
, Galdino was seen standing behind Buggy, both of them greatly shocked.
Galdino then followed Buggy and his group as Buggy starts to execute his plan. Galdino is seen screaming when Buggy got caught by a sandstorm created by
Crocodile
.
Later in the battle, Galdino disguised himself as an executioner and manages to approach Ace's execution ground. He's ready to free Ace and in doing so avenging
Bentham
but had to abide by
Sengoku
's sudden order to have Ace instantly executed and pretended to do so, no doubt ready to reveal his true intention to liberate Ace at that point, leading to him being knocked out by Luffy's
Haki
. He regains consciousness when Luffy finally reaches the ground, just in time to protect Ace from Sengoku's attack with a Candle Wall. When Kizaru destroys Luffy's key, Galdino makes one himself with his powers, managing to free Ace from his chains in midair, but not before asking Luffy that if his reasons for helping him free Ace was to respect a comrade's (Bentham) final wishes, would he laugh at him, to which the Straw Hat said no, while the platform is destroyed.
Both him and Luffy are thus saved by Ace, who protects them from the flames of the destroyed execution scaffold. Galdino is soon being dragged away by pirates while remarking that he thought that he was a goner when the Marines spotted him.
Marco
who wishes to support the others who are being attacked by Akainu, immediately orders Galdino to unlock his handcuffs with his ability and Marco is later seen engaging in battle with
Akainu
.
Post-War Arc
[
]
Galdino is shown to be joining the
Buggy and Alvida Alliance
on an island in the Grand Line. He was last seen reading a message for Buggy from the World Government, telling him he would not believe what it said.
It was later revealed that it was an invitation to Buggy to join the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
.
During the Timeskip
[
]
After Buggy is appointed a member of the Seven Warlords, Galdino becomes a member of
Buggy's Delivery
. It is assumed that he and the rest of the escaped Impel Down convicts who joined Buggy were pardoned as a result of Buggy's Warlord status.

Galdino and the rest of Buggy Pirates surprised to see Luffy and Boa Hancock fighting together on the Groseade.
Right after Buggy is made one of the Seven Warlords, the Buggy Pirates came across Luffy and Boa Hancock fighting
Sebastian
of the
World Pirates
. Galdino then informed Buggy that the World Pirates were the reason that the Warlords were summoned. The two then plotted to take credit for World's potential defeat at the hands of Luffy, and although he was initially worried, Galdino happily agreed with Buggy's backup plan of alerting the Marines and fleeing just in case anything went from.
When
Perona
defeated Sebastian, both Galdino and Buggy were surprised that she had been accompanying Mihawk. They then realized that Mihawk being there would have been great for the battle, but immediately figured that Mihawk was there to "steal" the credit. In response, Galdino told Buggy that they had to leave their traces in the battle to make sure that others knew that they were part of the fight.
On board the ship, they watched as
Byrnndi World
fought Luffy. When Luffy was defeated, Galdino commented on how easily he was defeated and then asked Buggy what their next move was. In response, Buggy ordered his crew to revive Luffy, but this is misinterpreted as an action of friendship, to which Galdino looked at them in disbelief at their high hopes in Buggy's character. After Luffy awakened, Galdino pointed Luffy in the direction that World went and once again stood in disbelief at the crew admiring Buggy for slapping Luffy awake.
Gairam defeats Galdino.
Later, the crew encountered
Gairam
while walking through the ship, to which Galdino noted that he did not look so friendly. They are then attacked by Gairam's
Cube Booster
attack. When Buggy yelled at Luffy to go fight World, his crew thought they were words of encouragement, to which Galdino yet again stood in disbelief at how they had positively interpreted Buggy's words. After Buggy told Luffy that he would take care of Gairam, Galdino questioned Buggy on how he would do so, but immediately after, Gairam attacked them with his
Air Cube Booster
. Before it could hit, however, Galdino used his Candle Wall and blocked the attack and then told Buggy and the crew to run. Gairam then smashed his hammer against the candle wall, which then sent Galdino falling backwards.
In the middle of Buggy's battle with Gairam, Buggy tried to bring his body back together, but failed when Gairam captured his main body. In response, Galdino asked Buggy what he was going to do now, to which Buggy revealed that he still had a trick up his sleeve. When Cabaji and Mohji asked if it was the Buggy Ball, Galdino remembered that that was the thing that Buggy used to fight the
Jailer Beasts
at Impel Down, but an annoyed Buggy then corrected him that that was actually the Muggy Ball at Impel Down, but that he was in fact actually going to use the Muggy Ball against Gairam. Gairam was then defeated when Hancock attacked him in the smoke that was created by the Muggy Ball. A surprised Galdino and Buggy then told her which way Luffy had gone. Afterwards, the crew believed that Buggy had taken down Gairam and so, Buggy happily took credit while Galdino pondered how long Buggy could keep his ruse up for.
The crew then made it outside the ship and saw a fleet of Marine ships approaching. Buggy was surprised at why the Marines were there, but Galdino quickly reminded him that he was the one that called them there. The Marines, on the other hand, did not realize that it was Buggy on the ship and were ordered by Akainu to fire. Galdino then rode on Buggy's back to escape the cannon fire as the crew withdrew back to their ship.
