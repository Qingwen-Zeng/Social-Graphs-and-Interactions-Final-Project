History

Past
[
]
Over 20 years ago, Kunyun was a subject in an experiment on
Punk Hazard
that attempted to
recreate
the
ancient giants
. The experiment was a failure, but Kunyun and her fellow test subjects were recruited by
Kaidou
. They began residing on
Onigashima
and joined Kaidou's crew, the
Beasts Pirates
, as a group called the
Numbers
.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Five days before the
Fire Festival
, the Numbers arrived in
Hakumai
via Mogura Port and headed toward Onigashima with
Scratchmen Apoo
.
Brook defeats Kunyun and the others.
On the day of the Fire Festival, Kunyun and the Numbers took part in the Beasts Pirates' Golden Kagura festivities.
During the
raid on Onigashima
, Kunyun,
Nure-Onna
, and
Tenjo-Sagari
confronted
Nico Robin
and
Brook
. Due to the illusion mist created by
Black Maria
, Kunyun appeared to Robin in the form of
Jaguar D. Saul
. Robin pretended to be fooled by the illusion, but attacked Kunyun and her cohorts with
Tres Mano: Freesia
when they were off-guard. Kunyun then chased Robin and Brook alongside a group of Gifters, as Brook prepared to confront them.
After Brook made a
wall of ice
between them and Maria, Kunyun heard screams from the other side and, peeking through the small gap in the wall, was horrified to see Black Maria defeated with the demonic-looking Robin standing over her. Brook took the opportunity to finish off Kunyun and Black Maria's other subordinates, with
Phrase d'armes: Orchestra
.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, Kunyun responds to
Queen
's roll call with
Hatcha
and
Goki
.
In the anime, she is replaced with
Juki
,
likely because her nature beyond her laugh had not been revealed in the manga at the time.
