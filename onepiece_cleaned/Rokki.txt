Personality
[
]
Rokki guards the gate to the armory on
Onigashima
, and seems to be diligent in this, as
Yamato
stated that he would likely have to fight him to get past him. However, Rokki was also shown to be asleep at the door, even as a war had broken out above him.
Like the other Numbers, he possesses a
unique laugh
based on his name: "Rorokiki"
(
ロロキキィ
?
)
. When he was attacked by Fuga, he also made the sound "Rokya"
(
ロキャ

)
.

Past
[

Over 20 years ago, Rokki was a subject in an experiment on
Punk Hazard
that attempted to
recreate the ancient giants
. The experiment was a failure, but Rokki and his fellow test subjects were recruited by
Kaidou
. They began residing on
Onigashima
and joined Kaidou's crew, the
Beasts Pirates
, as a group called the
Numbers
.
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Five days before the
Fire Festival
, the Numbers arrived in
Hakumai
via Mogura Port and headed toward
Onigashima
with
Scratchmen Apoo
.
Fuga rams Rokki through the armory's gate.
On the night of the Fire Festival, Rokki was stationed at the gate to the armory and fell asleep. However, he was unexpectedly attacked by fellow Number
Fuga
on
Yamato
's orders. Fuga's attack also broke open the gate, and Fuga held down Rokki while Yamato entered the armory.
