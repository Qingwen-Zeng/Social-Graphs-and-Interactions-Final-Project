History

Whole Cake Island Arc

Nougat joined many of his siblings and crewmates in occupying
Cacao Island
in order to ambush
Monkey D. Luffy
if he escaped from
Mirro-World
.
When
Charlotte Oven
suggested that Luffy would use
Brûlée
to escape, Nougat voiced his agreement. When the time came for Luffy to come out, the Big Mom Pirates prepared for battle.
Nougat heard a voice coming from the mirror, and to his surprise,
Pekoms
came out with a captive Brûlée and no Luffy in sight. However, Luffy was quickly exposed, and Nougat commended his ability to escape from
Katakuri
. As the Big Mom Pirates attacked their enemies, the skirmish was suddenly interrupted by
Germa 66
.
As the
Vinsmoke Family
facilitated Luffy and
Sanji
's escape, Nougat was utterly shocked when Brûlée revealed that Luffy had defeated Katakuri.
During the battle at Cacao Island, Nougat along with other members of the Big Mom Pirates used the anti-Germa bullets to injure the Vinsmokes.
