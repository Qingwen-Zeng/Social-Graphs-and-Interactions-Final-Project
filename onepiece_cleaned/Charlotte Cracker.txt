"Thousand Arms" Charlotte Cracker
is the tenth son and 15th child of the
Charlotte Family
and the oldest triplet brother of
Custard
and
Angel
.
He is also one of the
Three Sweet Commanders
of the
Big Mom Pirates
and serves as
Totto Land
's
Minister of Biscuits
(
ビスケット大臣
,
Bisuketto Daijin
?
)
, governing
Biscuits Island
.
Due to his actions and role, he is a major antagonist in the
Whole Cake Island Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Cracker is a muscular man of notable height, at 307 cm.
He has pink eyes and short, purple hair with a long, baguette-like bun tied at the back of his head and a pair of thin, pointed strands on either side that appear to spark like firecrackers. A very large scar covers his right eye and he has small wrinkles around both eyes. Cracker is shirtless and wears a kilt with decorative biscuits adorning it as well as shin length brown boots on his lower half. On his right shoulder, he wears a large brightly colored pauldron that has a pink polka dot cape attached to it.
Cracker usually operates within a suit of biscuit armor, created by his Devil Fruit, and will only show himself if the armor is damaged or destroyed. This is to such an extent that his wanted poster mistakenly features the face of his armor, rather than his true appearance. This armor takes the form of a large, brutish-looking warrior (standing about four times bigger than Luffy) with a prominent nose, a large pointed beard, disproportionately thin limbs, and a prominent scar on the right side of its face (which it shares with the real Cracker). It is also fitted with a vest made of crackers, a Spartan-style warrior's helmet, and horns worn on the side of its head.
Personality
[
]
Cracker is very loyal to his family and crew, demonstrated by his anger upon discovering that his
former stepfather
was revealing their secrets to
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Nami
.
He firmly believes that one's heritage defines their character, incorrectly assuming that
Sanji
would happily consent to his arranged wedding out of loyalty to his
family
and that he would detest the Straw Hat Pirates for coming to Whole Cake Island to rescue him, oblivious to the fact that Sanji opposed the wedding and would never willingly speak ill of his friends.
Like Big Mom and most of his siblings like his older brother
Oven
, he considers his own father and stepfathers to not be part of his family because they are not related by blood.
Cracker is very confident in his power and prefers to deal with enemies alone, hating outside interference from his fellow crew members.
He takes joy in using his Devil Fruit powers and overwhelming his enemies with their versatility;
on the other hand, he hates it when people eat his biscuit creations as he does not like giving away biscuits for free.
Cracker also absolutely despises feeling any amount of pain, even the prick of a needle, and prefers to fight others with his biscuit creations. He is also very proud of his anonymity, referring to the World Government's incorrect photo of him in his
wanted poster
.
Like the rest of his family, Cracker is very arrogant and views himself superior to his opponents, mocking Luffy throughout most of the fight. He also tends to brag during his fights due to how powerful his Biscuit Soldiers can be. He decided to tell Luffy how his powers worked after the latter was able to discover his true appearance as a mocking gesture. This later proved to be a costly mistake on his part, as Luffy and Nami were able to take advantage of the knowledge Cracker gave them in order to defeat him.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
As her tenth son and Sweet Commander, Cracker is very loyal to his captain and mother
Big Mom
. Big Mom has confidence in his ability as she sent Cracker to assist his sister
Charlotte Brûlée
in dealing with Luffy, attempting to prevent him from seeing Sanji.
Charlotte Brûlée
[
]
As half-siblings, they get along quite well. Even though Brûlée believed that she could handle the Straw Hats herself, Cracker still followed Big Mom's orders to assist her.
Father and Stepfathers
[
]
Like his mother and many of his siblings, Cracker has no concern for his father and step-fathers and believed they are no longer part of the Charlotte family.
Crew and Associates
[
]
As one of the Sweet Commanders, Cracker is very loyal to the Big Mom Pirates. Like all the members of the crew, he addresses his mother Big Mom as Mama. When Cracker was defeated, he was found by his siblings who gathered up an army to avenge his defeat by attacking and defeating Luffy and Nami.
Randolph
[
]
Randolph
respects Cracker very well. When Randolph attempted to assist him against Luffy, Cracker ordered him not to interfere which made Randolph apologize to him. Randolph is shown to fear Cracker as he would blame his crane to avoid the latter's wrath.
Kingbaum
[
]
Kingbaum
and all the Homies are loyal to the Big Mom Pirates and respect Cracker's authority. However, when
Nami
held a
Vivre Card
containing Big Mom's soul fragment and forced him to act against Cracker, the Sweet Commander threatened to tell his mother of Baum's lack of allegiance, refusing to take his excuses.
Enemies
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Cracker became an enemy of
Luffy
after the latter arrived at Whole Cake Island. On his mother's orders, Cracker served as an obstacle in preventing Luffy from seeing
Sanji
. Cracker constantly made false assumptions of Sanji's opinion on the wedding and the Straw Hat Pirates, which Luffy found highly offensive, who in turn, irked the Sweet Commander by eating all of his biscuit soldiers. Like the rest of his crew, save for
Katakuri
, Cracker underestimated Luffy, a mistake he realized after Luffy managed to overcome him and send him flying through the sky into Sweet City.
Nami
[
]
Since
Nami
is part of Luffy's group, this makes her Cracker's enemy as well. Cracker was particularly furious at Nami for her ordering the Homies around with the Vivre Card and producing rain to soften his biscuit soldiers for Luffy to devour.
Pound
[
]
Like other Big Mom's ex-husbands, Cracker said to Pound that his ex-wife does not care about all of her former husbands and has no qualms trying to kill his former step-father.
Blackbeard Pirates
[
]
Cracker fought against
Van Augur
and
Kuzan
during their invasion of
Cacao Island
, but was frozen in place.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of the Three Sweet Commanders of the
Big Mom Pirates
, Cracker's authority in the crew is second only to
his mother
's. As the Minister of Biscuit, Cracker rules over Biscuits Island and is responsible for procuring and distributing biscuits to whoever needs them.
He is also capable of commanding large fleets into battle.
Cracker's voice and presence alone are enough to cause nearby
homies
to shrink away and wither in fear, indicating that his power commands tremendous fear and respect among his fellow crewmates.
His bounty of
860,000,000 indicates that the
World Government
considers him highly dangerous and threatening to their operations.
His power and influence is so great that when he was defeated, Sweet City was put into a state of lockdown.
Big Mom was also confident that Cracker could defeat
Monkey D. Luffy
, who managed to bring down
Donquixote Doflamingo
, further testifying to his combat strength.
Though
Urouge
of the
Worst Generation
managed to defeat one of his fellow Sweet Commanders, Cracker defeated him afterward, though he did not manage to kill the Supernova.
In battle, Cracker has displayed exceptional skill in deception and trickery; when fighting Luffy, he made it appear as though he had Devil Fruit powers related to multiplying limbs and weapons
and when Luffy landed a powerful
Gomu Gomu no Kong Gun
on his armor, Cracker had it cough up blood-like jam in order to appear badly wounded by the blow.
He was able to effectively deceive the entire World Government and the Marines despite being an infamously powerful pirate, being able to conceal his true identity and make his Biscuit Soldier pose as himself to the point his bounty poster depicts the Soldier and not him.
Cracker has some degree of culinary skill, as he has created a jam concoction that resembles blood.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Cracker has also shown immense amounts of stamina, being able to fight and chase after Luffy for eleven hours.
He has extraordinary strength, able to wield Pretzel, a very large sword, while maintaining sufficient speed to keep up with Luffy. In the anime, he is shown being able to clash evenly with Luffy, who was in
Gear 4
, and pushing him back with Pretzel.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Further information:
Pretzel
Cracker's sword, Pretzel.
Cracker wields a huge double-edged sword named Pretzel, which is one of the
Meito
and a blade larger than himself with a crossguard shaped like a biscuit.
He claims that it is a unique sword which has no peers.
Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers each wield one or more much larger replicas of Pretzel made out of biscuit.
He can also create biscuit shields with his Devil Fruit.
Cracker is extremely skilled in wielding Pretzel, as he can attack very quickly despite the sword's size. Combined with Armament Haki, he was able to cut through Luffy’s Gear 4-enhanced Haki defenses with his sword.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Bisu Bisu no Mi
Cracker creates biscuit puppets.
Cracker ate the Bisu Bisu no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to create and manipulate biscuits at will. He creates the biscuits by clapping, and in addition to creating whole biscuits, he can crumble the biscuits into super-fine crumbs. The biscuits he creates are also super-durable, though they can be softened by water.
He primarily uses this power to create large puppet soldiers. He uses whole biscuits to shape the torso, and uses biscuit crumbs to create arms, legs, and the face of a tough guy. He can even use his biscuits to create weapons for his puppets.
Cracker can manipulate his puppets' bodies at will, including granting them extra limbs and additional weapons.
The puppets are hollow, so while Cracker can control them from afar, he can also hide inside them, using one as a suit of armor. He can even imbue the puppet he inhabits with
Armament Haki
, further increasing its defensive capabilities.
Haki
[
]
Further information:
Haki
Armament Haki
[
]
Cracker has extraordinarily powerful
Armament Haki
, which he uses to harden his sword(s) and biscuit armor. Defensively, it allowed him to easily repel Luffy's own Haki-imbued
Gear 2
and
Third
attacks, causing the latter to remark on its incredible toughness.
Offensively, it strengthened his sword enough to let him cut near-halfway through Luffy's Haki-imbued arm in
Gear 4
(a notable feat, as even Doflamingo had previously shown inability to harm Luffy's Gear 4 form).
Observation Haki
[
]
Cracker possesses the ability to use
Observation Haki
.
History
[

Past
[
]
Cracker leads a fleet against Urouge.
During an attempted invasion of
Big Mom's territory
,
Urouge
defeated one of the Sweet Commanders,
Snack
. Cracker was sent out to sea with
Prometheus
and
Zeus
and a massive
fleet
and defeated Urouge very quickly.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Big Mom
sent Cracker to assist his sister
Charlotte Brûlée
in dealing with
Monkey D. Luffy
, attempting to prevent him from seeing
Sanji
.
While
Pound
, one of Big Mom's husbands, was informing Luffy and
Nami
about the
homies
and
Big Mom's power
in the
Seducing Woods
, Cracker appeared within a
biscuit puppet
and scolded him for giving away information while pulling Pound out of the ground.
Cracker's attack on Pound is intercepted by Luffy.
As Cracker held Pound up,
Randolph
attempted to ambush Nami and Luffy, but Cracker ordered him to stop and intimidated the nearby homies into withering away. After berating Randolph for interfering, Cracker revealed that his mother had sent him to aid his sister because Luffy had defeated
Donquixote Doflamingo
and would have given her too much trouble otherwise. Brûlée, the homies, and the master of the Seducing Woods
Kingbaum
claimed that they would have succeeded, but Cracker wanted to leave no room for error right before the
Tea Party
. Cracker prepared to execute Pound with his mother's permission, only for Luffy to counter his sword swing and kick him in the arm, forcing Cracker to release Pound. Cracker and Luffy engaged in battle, but Cracker quickly blew Luffy away as he multiplied his limbs and declared that Luffy had no chance of defeating him.
Luffy attacked Cracker with his
Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun
, but Cracker blocked it with his shield before striking Luffy with his multiple Haki-imbued swords, which blasted him away. Luffy tried attacking Cracker with his
Hawk Gatling
, but Cracker once again overpowered him with his shield. After slamming Luffy onto the ground with his shield, Cracker attempted to convince him that
Sanji
would be happier leaving the
Straw Hat Pirates
. However, an angered Luffy retaliated by activating
Gear 4
and successfully landing a Gomu Gomu no Kong Gun on Cracker.
Cracker wearing down Luffy's stamina with his Biscuit Soldiers.
After Luffy managed to shatter his biscuit puppet with another Kong Gun, Cracker emerged from it and cut Luffy's right arm with
Pretzel
. Revealing his true
Devil Fruit
abilities to Luffy, Cracker created multiple Biscuit Soldiers as he declared that Luffy could not beat him. As Luffy attacked the soldiers with Gomu Gomu no Kong Organ, Cracker leaped out from behind them to attack Luffy with Honey Pretzel, barely missing his head.
Cracker is defeated by Gomu Gomu no Cannonball.
The battle lasted for eleven more hours, with Luffy finding a way to eat Cracker's biscuit soldiers with the help of Nami's rain and adopting a strategy of fighting, eating, and running away. This causes Cracker to grow increasingly irate, but he gleefully anticipated Luffy exploding from the sheer amount of biscuits he ate.
As Cracker produced more biscuit soldiers, he reprimanded Kingbaum for standing against him, but Kingbaum explained that the homies could not oppose Nami due to the
Vivre Card
in her possession. Cracker then complained to Nami for
creating rain
that softened his biscuit soldiers, enabling Luffy to eat them. Feeling that the battle had dragged on long enough, Cracker sent his biscuit soldiers charging at Luffy. Nami used Rain Spark and softened the soldiers, which Luffy then devoured. As Luffy was reaching his limit, Cracker prepared to strike Luffy, who then used another form of Gear 4 called Tankman: Full Version. When Cracker tried to pierce Luffy with his sword, he got sucked into Luffy's body and was sent flying while destroying the remainder of the biscuit soldiers.
Cracker was propelled with extreme force, flying well past the Seducing Woods and destroying some tree homies on the way. He flew into Sweet City and crashed into the
Whole Cake Chateau
, where he was found unconscious by his siblings
Mont-d'Or
,
Galette
, and
Opera
.

Chocolat Town
.
Cracker and Brûlée went to the island to investigate. He attempted to stop

Confrontation with Urouge
[
]
In the anime, a flashback of Cracker's battle with Urouge is added. Following Snack's defeat, Cracker quickly appears and overwhelms the heavily wounded Urouge.
Battle at the Seducing Woods
[
]
Cracker's fight with Luffy is extended heavily in the anime, showing additional scenes of their 11-hour struggle. After Luffy activated Gear 4, more scenes are shown of Luffy engaging with and destroying a large number of Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers. Cracker also clashed with Luffy in close combat, showing his expert swordsmanship. Luffy nearly lands a devastating hit on Cracker with Gomu Gomu no King Kong Gun, but his Gear 4 wears out at the last second. He is then blown away as a result of deflating in the air. Cracker and his Biscuit Soldiers then set off to find the weakened Luffy, who attempts to hide but is found by one of the soldiers.
Afterwards, Nami (with Kingbaum and the Seducing Woods homies under her command) rescued Luffy and fought against Cracker and his Biscuit Soldiers to buy Luffy time to recover. Nami was overpowered and about to be killed, but Luffy recovered just in time to save Nami and resume his fight against Cracker. There are additional scenes of the two exploiting the Biscuit Soldiers' weakness to being wet, with Nami controlling the weather to rain on them while Luffy knocks a Biscuit Soldier into a nearby river to splash other nearby dry ones. There are also additional scenes of Luffy devouring the dampened Biscuit Soldiers.
After Luffy activated Gear 4 Tankman in the manga, Cracker only used Honey Pretzel against him. In the anime, Cracker first tried slashing at Luffy only to find the strike ineffective. When he used Honey Pretzel, that attack also failed, having been deflected by Luffy's hardened body. Cracker then used an anime-only attack called Crash Pretzel before he got absorbed into Luffy's stomach.

Cover Story arc
