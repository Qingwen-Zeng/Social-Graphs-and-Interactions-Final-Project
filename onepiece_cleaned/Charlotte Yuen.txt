Yuen is a very tall young man, towering over those of average height. He wears a black round helmet with two horn-like spikes, which covers all of his head besides his broad face. He has small and simplified facial features, which appear mask-like even though they are real, as they are seen moving. He wears a brown biscuit-patterned shirt similar to that of
Cracker
's Biscuit Soldiers, a pink sash across his waist, and wide red vertically-striped pants. He also wears a very large light yellow cape that has an orange flower design on the top left.

Yuen is loyal to his family and crew, as he came to
Cacao Island
to take on the
Straw Hat Pirates

He appears to hate being ignored, as his normally jovial expression changed into anger when he noticed Sanji looking away from him, which he said was rude and caused him to attack.
He has a tendency to add the suffix "-yu" at the end of his sentences.

History

Whole Cake Island Arc
[

Yuen came to
Cacao Island
along with many of his siblings and crewmates to stand guard in preparation for an attack on the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
As
Raisin
discussed Luffy's next possible course of action, Yuen mentioned that
Brûlée
went missing. As the Straw Hats' promised rendezvous time drew near, the Big Mom Pirates prepared to ambush Luffy once he exited the Mirro-World.

Luffy came out on time with
Pekoms
and a captured Brûlée, and made headway as
Sanji
came in to assist him and Pekoms took on the Big Mom Pirates. However, as Sanji was taking Luffy through the sky, Yuen and three of his
decuplet
brothers used Geppo to confront them. When Sanji got distracted by Pekoms' situation, Yuen got annoyed and used his staff to smash the two Straw Hats into the ground. However, the skirmish was interrupted by the sudden arrival of
Germa 66
.
Germa's interference allowed Sanji and Luffy to escape, and as Yuen tried attacking them again, the orb of his staff was shattered by
Vinsmoke Yonji
. He was then grabbed and swung around by Yonji's extended hand, sending him crashing into buildings and his crewmates and defeating him.
