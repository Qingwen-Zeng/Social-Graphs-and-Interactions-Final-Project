When
Portgas D. Ace
was to be executed at
Marineford
, Brocca and her crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
in order to save him from execution. While the
Marines
were bracing for the arrival of the pirates, Brocca and the allied fleet of the 43 subordinate captains caught them by surprise when the fleet suddenly appeared out of nowhere just off the shores of Marineford.
Some time into the battle, the
Pacifistas
began encircling and moving towards the pirates within the bay. In response to the unknown force behind them, Brocca questioned alongside

what exactly the enemy force approaching them was.
At the end of the war, the
Red Hair Pirates
arrived and
