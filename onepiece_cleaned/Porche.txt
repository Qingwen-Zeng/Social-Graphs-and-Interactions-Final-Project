, Porche, and

by throwing them a rope and having all three of them aboard. Porche and the rest of the crew started crying and
Sanji
comforted her by giving her soup.
After the soup, Porche admired all the gold the Straw Hats had. They later spotted their ship, the
Sexy Foxy
. Once united with their crew, they started crying out of joy. It was then revealed that the
Fanged Toad Pirates
had taken it over.
Before the three of them could take back the ship, the captain of the
Fanged Toad Pirates
took Porche as a hostage. She then had to watch as Foxy and Hamburg got beaten up. Luffy then started fighting for Foxy to get his crew back.
Once Luffy took back the ship, Foxy used his

to trick and capture Luffy and the rest of his crew except Chopper and
Robin
. Luffy and the rest of the crew escaped, leaving Porche and the rest of the

behind.

to steal a notebook from
Sayo
, which contained a secret in making jewels. When stealing the notebook, they came across the

once again. Porche went with Hamburg and Foxy into their new mecha, which bounced the Noro Noro Beam in different directions and slowed everybody in their surroundings down so that they could steal the notebook, but after they met the Straw Hat Pirates' new crew members,
Franky
and
Brook
, their mecha was destroyed and was sent flying off of Spa Island as a result.
Later on, Porche was seen worrying in Doran's office as Hamburg was getting the water out of Foxy after getting back onto the island.

Once the treasure was found to be a circular rainbow in the sky, Porche and the rest chased Doran after he swam off.
Dressrosa Saga

Adventure of Nebulandia
[
]
The Foxy Pirates continued their adventures into the New World, resuming their Davy Back Fight winning streak, but were always laughed at due to their Jolly Roger. Porche was present when Foxy defeated
Komei
in a Davy Back Fight, and watched as Komei donned his Foxy Pirates mask and shook hands with Foxy.
Porche took part in a plot to disguise the Foxy Pirates and lure the Straw Hat Pirates to
Kinoko Island
, which was successful. Luffy accepted Foxy's challenge to a Davy Back Fight rematch, and the first round, the Eating Contest, began. Porche, Hamburg, and
Dojaku
competed against Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji to see who could eat a pile of mushrooms the fastest. Porche and Hamburg took off eating, and Porche asked Dojaku why he wasn't eating anything, but her crewmate replied that he had a plan. Suddenly, everyone who ate the mushrooms collapsed, only to rise up with no motivation whatsoever. Komei revealed that this was part of his plan to capture the Straw Hats as he and Dojaku turned the arena into a cage, trapping Porche, Hamburg, and the Straw Hats. The cage was then pulled up to the Sexy Foxy, which sailed away under Komei's command.
Foxy frees Porche and Hamburg from captivity.
Porche, Hamburg, Zoro, and Sanji were taken to Nebulandia and thrown into a cell, and Komei plotted to execute the two Foxy Pirates due to them being pirates. The next morning, Foxy arrived and freed Porche and Hamburg, administering an antidote that gave them their motivation back. However, Porche and Hamburg said they needed to get something back before heading out, and their captain and crewmates followed them.
The Foxy Pirates later emerged outside as the Straw Hats beat back the Marines. They then headed back to Kinoko Island, where Foxy ended his cease-fire with Luffy and attacked him. However, Nami tricked him and attacked Foxy, Porche, and Hamburg with a lightning bolt. The Straw Hats then sailed away, and the Foxy Pirates bid them farewell as they prepared to resume their own adventures.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the "Hit and Dead ball" matches (anime only), she, along with the other Foxy pirate females, easily takes the ball and outs Sanji by flirting with him. She then steals the ball from Luffy, as his arm stretches to throw the final pitch at Operation Bulls-eye kun, operated by Foxy.
She also rides on Hamburg during the "Who touched Daruma San" (anime only). They manage to stay in the lead with
Chiqicheetah
, until she is thrown off the side of the cliff. Sanji jumps into the water to save her, to which she rewards him by kissing him on the cheek, causing him to lose his concentration and they both begin to sink. She resurfaces and yells at him to keep swimming and angrily asks if he wants her to drown.
She later reappears in a few filler episodes with Foxy and Hamburg after losing their crew in an anime only outcome of the Davy Back Fight. She mostly chases Chopper around before the Straw Hats help get the crew back only for Foxy's group to betray them. She joins in attacking Nami only to be beaten by her. During the final attempt, Porche is treated to food by Sanji. She flirts with him to get him to join her crew only to be denied. She contacts her crew for a ride after Foxy is knocked out. She parts with Sanji after complimenting his cooking.
