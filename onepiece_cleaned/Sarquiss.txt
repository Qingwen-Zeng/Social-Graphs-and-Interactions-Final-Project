"Big Knife" Sarquiss
was the
first mate
of the
Bellamy Pirates
, with a
bounty
of
38,000,000 on his head.
His epithet originates from the large dagger he always wields, which bears a strong resemblance to a massive
kukri
.
Due to his actions, he can be considered a supporting antagonist of the
Jaya Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Sarquiss is a tall, muscular man with white skin. He has  wavy, shoulder-length blue hair and wears a purple-tinted visor over his eyes. He also wears a white-furred coat over his bare chest in addition to golden chains that are either a necklace or a clasp. He has red-and-white striped gloves and pants with the same pattern alongside a gold belt.
On Sarquiss' bare chest is a tattoo of
Doflamingo
's
Jolly Roger
: a smiley with a cancel symbol. He also has the symbol on his belt.
When he was younger, he did not wear glasses, he wore a yellow sleeved shirt, a dark red jacket, and carried a sword on his back.
Personality
[
]
As far as personality is concerned, Sarquiss appears to not be very bright, but just as over-confident and self-absorbed as the rest of the pirates in Bellamy's crew. He was somewhat classy and prejudiced as he gave Luffy, Zoro, and Nami some
money
as a pity so they could buy decent clothes. He interpreted Zoro and Luffy's refusal to fight back when Bellamy challenged them at
Terry
's bar as an act of cowardice, and insisted that Bellamy's quick defeat at Luffy's hands was a "lucky shot" and even attempted to challenge the younger pirate, only to cringe once the Straw Hat captain finally gave Sarquiss his attention. Unfortunately he did not seem to learn from this, as soon after Luffy leaves, he ends up bumping into
Blackbeard
and made a rude remark towards him and continues to badmouth Luffy, to which the captain promptly smashes Sarquiss into the ground.
Just like his captain, he strongly believes that a
New Age
is coming and laughs at anyone who mentions their dreams. He also falsely believes that a
bounty
serves as a rating of a person's fighting level, making him believe himself to be a more powerful fighter than he truly is.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Sarquiss possesses a bounty of
38,000,000, an indication of his danger. He seems to be quite agile, but Cricket outclassed him and Blackbeard defeated him with great ease.
Weapons
[
]
Big Knife
[
]
Sarquiss uses a giant dagger, which resembles a giant
kukri
, to fight. It's what gave him his nickname: "Big-Knife" Sarquiss. He usually spins the blade like a windmill in front of him, as to show off. From his one named technique, Sarquiss shows certain acrobatic skills.
Big Chop
Big Chop
(
大刃撃
,
Biggu Choppu
?
, literally meaning "Large Blade Attack")
: Sarquiss' only-known named attack, where he spins vertically and uses his trademark, the "Big Knife" to turn himself into a human buzz-saw. He first used this against
Masira
, spinning vertically while jumping, cutting Masira multiple times.
Others
[

During the time the Bellamy Pirates were still in North Blue, Sarquiss wielded a katana on his back.
History
[
]
Sarquiss, just like the rest of
his crewmates
, was born in
North Blue
, specifically in a peaceful town known as
Notice
. During his childhood, he heard the fairy tale
Liar Noland
and was often told by adults that if he lied a lot, he would be executed like
Mont Blanc Noland
.
Growing up, he and the others left the town to become pirates. When they met
Donquixote Doflamingo
, the latter gave them the possibility of wearing his
Jolly Roger
as long as they did not dishonor him.
Sky Island Saga
[
]
Jaya Arc
[
]
Sarquiss was sitting with
Lily
at the counter of the Wild Cherry, while Bellamy was playing cards with
Roshio
. When Bellamy lost, he stabbed Roshio's hand and claimed that Roshio had cheated. When asked to confirm the cheating, Sarquiss turned around and supported his captain. Bellamy shot Roshio in the leg and smashed a bottle of alcohol on his head, and Sarquiss then threw a lit match at Roshio, who caught fire before breaking through the window and falling from the building.
Sarquiss returned with Lily to the hotel, where he saw
Luffy
,
Zoro
, and
Nami
with
Spector
. Sarquiss and Lily were disgusted that the three pirates had been let in. Dismissive of Luffy's challenege, Sarquiss dropped money in front of him so that they could buy more decent clothes; however, Nami refused to accept the insult and pulled Luffy away. After the
Straw Hat Pirates
left,
Rivers
showed Luffy's
wanter poster
to Sarquiss. Although the amount was for less than his own and Bellamy's, Sarquiss still wanted to inform Bellamy about it.
After meeting up with their captain, the whole crew entered the Pub and Pies bar. Sarquiss was disgusted by the quality of the bar and its patrons. He then killed two men to free up some chairs and licked some of the blood off his blade. Sarquiss laughed as Bellamy began attacking Luffy. When Nami asked the
bartender
for information on how to reach the
Sky Island
, the whole bar burst out laughing. After seeing many glasses, bottles, barrels, and more thrown at the Straw Hats, Sarquiss pointed out to Bellamy that they must want the show to go on.
When Nami asked her crewmates to fight back, Sarquiss remarked that they knew that they were outclassed. He also could not believe the
Marines
wanted
30,000,000 for Luffy. After the humiliation of the two pirates, Sarquiss offered to buy Nami, but she refused and insulted the crew, at which Sarquiss sneered. Nami then dragged Luffy and Zoro out of the bar. Sarquiss sat down for a drink and heard a ruckus outside.
Later, Sarquiss and the rest of the crew went to Jaya to attack the
Saruyama Alliance
for their gold.
Sarquiss tried to attack
Mont Blanc Cricket
, but
Masira
shielded Cricket with his body and then fell to the ground unconscious. Sarquiss then boasted that their strength justified their claim of the treasure.
Shoujou
struck the others with his sonar, but Bellamy silenced him with a violent punch, throwing him into the sea. The captain then ordered his crew to retrieve the gold in order to leave quickly. Once on the ship, the crew headed back to Mock Town.
Inside the Pub and Pies, the Bellamy Pirates ridiculed the Saruyama Alliance members. Suddenly,
Jobo
entered the bar and informed Bellamy that the pirates they had mistreated in the morning had rewards of
100,000,000 and
60,000,000, which shocked everyone into silence. When they heard Luffy yell at Bellamy, Sarquiss and the others went outside to watch the two captains fight. Sarquiss told Jobo to throw away Luffy's poster since Luffy did not look so dangerous, doubting even the earlier reward. As Bellamy used
his powers
to increase the speed of him bouncing between the various buildings there, Sarquiss called for him to kill Luffy. However, Luffy defeated Bellamy with one punch.
Sarquiss could not believe what had happened and yelled for Bellamy to come to his senses and not to joke around. Luffy's wanted poster then blew into Sarquiss' face, and he panicked as the truth sunk in. Luffy ordered the return of the stolen gold.
As Luffy walked away with the gold, Sarquiss challenged him and demanded to know where he was headed. When Luffy stopped and turned back, Sarquiss was so scared that he fell backwards, but Luffy only pointed and said that he was going to the sky.
Later, Sarquiss bumped into
Blackbeard
and, in his foul mood, challenged the other pirate;however, Blackbeard slammed Sarquiss' head into the ground, knocking him unconscious.

Donquixote Doflamingo
, who, with his
powers
, forced Bellamy and Sarquiss to fight each other as punishment for disgracing themselves under his flag. Sarquiss begged for mercy, and Bellamy pleaded for another chance, but Doflamingo merely laughed and forced Sarquiss to slash his captain with his "Big Knife".
Later Events
[
]
Later, he would travel with Bellamy and the other members of the crew to a Sky Island, finding a golden pillar in the process. Although Bellamy managed to bring this back to Doflamingo and regain his trust, it is unknown what became of Sarquiss and the rest of the Bellamy Pirates when their captain forfeited his captaincy to join the
