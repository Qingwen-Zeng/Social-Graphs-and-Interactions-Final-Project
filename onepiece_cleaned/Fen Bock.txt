Past

Four years ago, he was a prisoner on
Punk Hazard
before the incident involving
Vegapunk
's chemical weapon. After the incident, he lost the use of his legs due to the poisonous gas, but when Caesar Clown came to the island a year later, he was given artificial legs. Because of this, he and the other ex-prisoners gladly accepted Caesar as their master, not knowing he was the one who caused their paralysis. Later on, when
Trafalgar Law
came to the island, he was given animal legs along with the other ex-prisoners.

He was first seen fighting the
G-5
Marines
outside of the lab along with the other ex-prisoners.
He witnessed when one of the
G-5
ships exploded, and he was terrified when slime globs from Smiley landed close to him and his comrades.
He eventually retreated into the lab at Caesar's behest, and he warned his comrades that the laboratory shutter doors were being opened to let the G-5 Marines in.
Later, when
Monkey D. Luffy
started to corner Caesar, the scientist ordered the deadly
H2S
gas to be released into the lab, and how the subordinates can be replaced. Under the delusion that Caesar's cruelty was a ruse, Bock, among with the other subordinates, were horrified when Caesar used the gas he fused with to kill the subordinates present in the battlefield.
After Caesar's defeat, he appears to have survived. He is seen escaping from the laboratory along with the
Straw Hat Pirates
and the
G-5 marines
