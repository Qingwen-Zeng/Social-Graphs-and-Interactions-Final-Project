Giberson was invited to
Big Mom
's
Tea Party
, where
Charlotte Pudding
and
Sanji
would get married. He and several other emperors arrived on
Whole Cake Island
, and when
Morgans
expressed excitement at reporting the tea party in the news, Giberson replied that the news would be old once it reached the Underworld.
Charlotte Perospero
then escorted the emperors to the banquet hall on a
candy escalator
, and the tea party began.
As the tea party began, Giberson and his fellow emperors presented Big Mom with their gifts. They were excited to see the
Tamatebako
nearby and hear that Big Mom would reveal its contents after the wedding ceremony. Later, he mingled with
Vinsmoke Reiju
.
As the wedding cake was presented to the attendees by
Streusen
, Giberson and Morgans were amazed at the sight of it.
During the wedding ceremony,
Monkey D. Luffy
and several copies of him burst out of the cake, and in the midst of the chaos, one of the Luffy duplicates jumped on Giberson's back and began playing with his hat.
Giberson suffering Linlin's Scream.
When the
Big Mom Pirates
revealed their treachery to the
Vinsmoke Family
, Giberson was amused by how
Vinsmoke Judge
was crying in the face of death.
Moments later, Luffy caused Big Mom to start her strange scream and Giberson was immobilized from having to cover his ears.
When the Tamatebako dropped to the base of the
Whole Cake Chateau
, the bomb inside the chest exploded, causing the chateau to topple over. As the castle collapsed, Giberson fell with it.
