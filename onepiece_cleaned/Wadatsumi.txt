"Large Monk" Wadatsumi
is a giant
tiger blowfish
fish-man
and a member of the
Sun Pirates
. He was formerly a member of the
Flying Pirates
under captain
Vander Decken IX
before they were defeated.
Appearance
[
]
Wadatsumi is an enormous
fish-man
, equal in size to the head of the
kraken
,
Surume
. He is large enough to make the giant-sized
Shirahoshi
and
Megalo
look like a regular-sized mermaid and shark.
His round head and chest are quite big in comparison to his arms and legs. His hands are webbed. He has a big, round face, with a large mouth full of massive, round teeth quite distant from one another, and child-like eyes. He has some stubble on his chin and dark hair surrounding his head, taking the shape of a protrusion pointing upward at the top, which also covers a part of his shoulders. His whole body is also quite hairy.
He apparently wears a pair of extremely loose pants paired with a dark indument tied around his waist, and has been seen walking barefoot.
His overall shape, size, and eyes strongly resemble that of
Sanjuan Wolf
's. Due to his appearance, Wadatsumi was incorrectly called an
Umibozu
by
Usopp
.
Members of the
New Fish-Man Pirates
also refer to him as such.
Personality
[
]
He is loyal and obedient, following Decken's every command without question. Despite his huge size, his personality appears to be childlike, mirrored by his extremely childlike voice in the anime.
Believing Decken has abandoned him, Wadatsumi cried and complained, but recovered when he was deceived into thinking he misheard, showing that Wadatsumi is naïve and gullible.
Contrary to the nasty reputation and behavior of his crew and captain, Wadatsumi seems to be more of a gentle and kind nature, as he destroyed two towns only due to sheer carelessness, which he apologized for in a genuinely remorseful manner,
and cheerfully celebrated with the citizens upon resolving the situation.
Another example was at
Whole Cake Island
, where after he reunited with some of the Straw Hat crew, Wadatsumi apologized for the trouble he gave them before at
Fish-Man Island
.
Relationships
[
]
Vander Decken IX
[
]
Wadatsumi was once loyal to Decken until the latter abandoned him when he was trying to kill Shirahoshi. While Wadatsumi was initially tearful at this, he was deceived by
Zeo
into thinking he heard wrong. After Decken's arrest and Wadatsumi's exile from Fish-Man Island, Wadatsumi spoke no more of his former captain.
Sun Pirates
[
]
Wadatsumi became a member of the Sun Pirates after following Jinbe. Wadatsumi stated he had fun hanging around with the Sun Pirates.
Jinbe
[
]
Though initially enemies, Wadatsumi has become close friends with Jinbe, helping the latter to transport a Poneglyph to Totto Land. Later, Wadatsumi destroyed several of the Big Mom Pirates' ships to assist Jinbe.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Wadatsumi puffing himself up.
Due to his great size, and the fact that he is a fish-man, he is extremely powerful. He hurt
Ankoro
, a fish several times the size of the
Thousand Sunny
, with a single punch despite not meaning to. He is also capable of picking up, carrying, and throwing entire buildings. He helped Jinbe transport an enormous and heavy poneglyph. Because of his size, he can easily create disturbances in the water; simply bursting out of the sea in the middle of the
Big Mom Pirates
' fleet was enough to send several ships flying into the distance. As a fish-man, he is capable of breathing underwater as well as surviving the crushing pressure of 10,000 meters below sea level. Being a tiger blowfish fish-man, he is also capable of inflating himself, thus increasing his already enormous size.
After taking an
Energy Steroid
, his great strength increases further by being able to defeat Surume with one blow. He also has high stamina, taking powerful strikes from Jinbe and Sanji respectively and only slightly complaining about the pain.
Attacks
[
]
Mega Nyudo
(
メガ入道
,
Mega Nyūdō
?
, literally meaning "Mega Monk")
: Wadatsumi inhales a large amount of air, and expands his stomach to enormous proportions, crushing anything in his vicinity. If needed, he can expand even more, furthering his size. However, he must hold his mouth to prevent the air from leaking out, and if he wishes to talk, he must speak in a fast pace to prevent air leakage. As he says, in this form he attacks by rolling into the battlefield, crushing all enemies in his way. This was first seen used against Sanji, though he indiscriminately crushed his New Fish-Man Pirates allies. This is called
Mega Monk
in the Viz manga and FUNimation sub and
Intimidation Mega Monk
in the FUNimation dub.
History

Fish-Man Island Saga

Fish-Man Island Arc

The Kraken knocks out Wadatsumi.
While the
Straw Hat Pirates
were sailing through the
Underworld of the Sea
, Wadatsumi suddenly appeared from the rocks beneath the sea. He beat an angler fish with one blow to prevent it from eating the
Thousand Sunny
because the captain of the
Flying Dutchman
,
Vander Decken IX
, wanted their treasure. On Vander Decken's orders, Wadatsumi attempted to punch the Thousand Sunny, but the
kraken
(which had been tamed by
Luffy
,
Zoro
, and
Sanji
) intervened and knocked out Wadatsumi.
When the volcano erupted, Vander Decken ordered Wadatsumi and
Ankoro
to pull the ship away from the magma. As the water temperature rose, he and the Flying Dutchman were thrown forward.
Later while Wadatsumi walked on the sea floor and pulled the Flying Dutchman, Vander Decken IX asked how many years it had been that the
Mermaid Princess
had not replied to his letters. Wadatsumi answered that it had been ten years and the princess still had not replied, enraging Decken. In
Noah
in the
Fish-Man District
, Wadatsumi watched as Vander Decken IX and
Hody Jones
formed an alliance.
After Luffy took down Decken at
Coral Hill
, Decken called out to Wadatsumi to prevent Princess Shirahoshi from escaping. Before Wadatsumi attacked, Luffy beat him back with a
Jet Pistol
, breaking off one of his teeth. Wadatsumi cried out in pain as Shirahoshi, Luffy, and their friends escaped.
Back in the Fish-Man District, Wadatsumi ran away, deeply shocked that his captain
"threw"
Noah toward Shirahoshi.
When Noah and the
Flying Pirates
arrived in
Gyoncorde Plaza
, Wadatsumi fell into the plaza and begged for his life. Decken replied that he cannot stop the boat anymore and that he would become a necessary sacrifice for the end of
Fish-Man Island
. Fortunately, the boat went after Shirahoshi, who had left the island to sacrifice herself.
Wadatsumi knocks out Surume.
Wadatsumi was then beaten up by Surume. Saddened by Decken's betrayal, the giant had no will to fight back.
Zeo
talked Wadatsumi into fighting and gave him an
Energy Steroid
. Now stronger than before, Wadatsumi defeated Surume. He then tried to attack
Jinbe
, who managed to deflect the attack, causing Wadatsumi to fall to the ground. Sanji then kicked him in the head, forcing the giant to stand up. Wadatsumi fought against Jinbe and Sanji. Regardless of his size, Wadatsumi felt pain from their attacks.
Having a difficult time, Wadatsumi started inflating himself, growing to a size that doubled his normal one. Sanji, standing on Wadatsumi's cheek, was not at all afraid of Wadatsumi's new form and started mocking him, telling him that Surume is still bigger than him. Wadatsumi fell for it and sucked in even more air, growing and crushing many
New Fish-Man Pirates
in the process, with Sanji still standing firm with his previous statement.
Wadatsumi is burned up by Sanji.
As Luffy pummeled Hody and Noah, Sanji stood on an almost-spherical Wadatsumi, who kept asking if the chef was surprised yet. While obviously neither him nor Jinbe were, they decided to execute their unseen plan.
Jinbe surrounded his right hand in water and hit Wadatsumi with
Buraikan
, which entered the giant on one side and exploded out of the other side. Wadatsumi began rolling away, but as he could not hold his breath any longer, he released the air he took in and blasted himself away. Sanji followed Wadatsumi into the sky and unleashed his rage by thinking back to the torture he had to go through during the last two years. His whole body engulfed by flames, Sanji kicked Wadatsumi with
Hell Memories
, a fire-attack so powerful it completely scorched Wadatsumi. With that, Wadatsumi was finally defeated. The unconscious Wadatsumi then fell on his unfortunate comrades who did not flee the plaza in time.
Wadatsumi being carried away by Surume.
After the battle, a still unconscious Wadatsumi was banished from Fish-Man Island (because he was too big to fit in any prison they have), and was carried away by Surume to the far reaches of the ocean.
Dressrosa Saga

Solo Journey of Jinbe, Knight of the Sea
[
]
Some time later, Wadatsumi traveled to a port town and posed as a sea god. In return for the offerings given to him, Wadatsumi raised up the homes at the bottom of the sea. He encountered Jinbe again while the former
Warlord
was investigating the disappearance of a
Sea Kitten
's home.
Having destroyed two towns due to his carelessness, Wadatsumi earned himself a scolding from Jinbe.
Wadatsumi and the Sea Beasts later apologized to the townspeople for the trouble they caused.
After they made peace with each other, Wadatsumi, Jinbe, the locals, and the Sea Beasts decided to have a feast together.
On the next day, Wadatsumi asked Jinbe if he could come along with him.
After bidding the townspeople and the Sea Beasts farewell, Wadatsumi left with Jinbe.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[

Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Wadatsumi was with the
Sun Pirates
while Jinbe was discussing with them about his intention to leave the
Big Mom Pirates
and join Luffy's crew.
Jinbe apologized to him for coming such a long way but Wadatsumi stated that it was alright. Later on, Wadatsumi and the Sun Pirates were instructed by Jinbe to leave
Totto Land
during the wedding ceremony due to security being busier with the events than focusing on them.
Wadatsumi saves the Sunny.
Hours later, Wadatsumi and the Sun Pirates arrived at Cacao Island to aid Jinbe and the Straw Hats in their escape.
The Sun Pirates cleared a path for the Thousand Sunny, but
Charlotte Oven
attacked them by boiling the sea.
Before the Queen Mama Chanter destroyed the Sunny, Wadatsumi switched it with the Sun Pirates' ship and hid the Sunny in his mouth. Wadatsumi then tried swimming far away from the Big Mom Pirates, but Oven attacked him with heat waves, forcing him to spit out the Sunny. Wadatsumi apologized to the Straw Hats for the trouble at Fish-Man Island before he was incapacitated. He then joined the rest of the Sun Pirates in holding off the Big Mom Pirates.
