30 years ago on an island in the
New World
, the
Takotopus Pirates
attempted to kidnap
Toki
by promising to give her a ride to
Wano Country
, but she figured out their trap and tried to flee. Sarai and some of his crewmates were able to corner her at the coast, forcing Toki to trigger her
ability
in order to escape. Before that could happen, however, a horribly swollen and disfigured
Oden
emerged from the sea, scaring away Sarai and the other pirates who had mistaken Oden for an
umibōzu
.
Later, the
Takotopus Pirates
' captain
Karma
personally arrived in order to capture both Oden and Toki, but
Whitebeard
swiftly dealt with him, prompting his subordinates to flee in terror.
His status thirty years later is unknown.
