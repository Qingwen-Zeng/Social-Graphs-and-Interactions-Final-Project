Chapter 929
.
Kurozumi Orochi
was the former
shogun
of
Wano Country
and one of the last members of the
Kurozumi Family
.
Persecuted in his youth due to his grandfather's failed attempt to seize the shogunate from the
Kouzuki Family
, Orochi encountered some relatives who helped him formulate another attempt to become shogun. This plan succeeded, with Orochi deposing the Kouzuki Family around three decades before the present day after allying with
Kaidou
of the
Four Emperors
.
Orochi ruled Wano tyrannically until he was deposed by none other than Kaidou, who betrayed him to seize Wano for himself;
Orochi survived Kaidou's attack and tried to kill everyone on
Onigashima
out of spite but was then killed after two encounters with the Kouzuki Family's
Nine Red Scabbards
who he knew had been prophesied to overthrow him.
Due to his actions and role, he is the secondary antagonist of the first half and a supporting antagonist in the second half of the
Wano Country Arc
, and one of the major antagonists of the
Wano Country Saga
overall.
Appearance
Orochi was a rather large man with a big head and stocky build. He appeared to be balding, with his dark purple hair being mostly seen on the sides and back of his head, and he had a long topknot in the back, as well as a thin mustache that sticked upward. His two upper canine teeth were longer than his other teeth and were blunt, remaining so in his Zoan hybrid form. He wore a gold kimono with a fan-shaped pattern on it, a blue robe with flowers on it, and a crown on his head.
In his transformed state, the main head was a darker olive green with red scales while the other heads were a lighter shade with yellow scales. Every head had black horns, orange eyebrows, and light purple scales. Each head also had red eyes with blue irises and purple tongues.
Personality
As one of the last members of the Kurozumi Family, who were disgraced and stripped of their power and authority, Orochi developed an immense greed and thirst for power from an early age due to being forced to live in poverty since birth. When he worked as a servant for Yasuie, Orochi outwardly exhibited a timid and servile attitude, but this was all an act to steal money by preying on the sympathies of others.
Orochi was in truth extremely deceptive and dishonorable, bending laws and rules to suit his own needs and never acknowledging promises or deals to those that he viewed as a threat.
Having been twisted by the Kurozumi Family's unfair persecution since his childhood, Orochi was an extremely cruel and oppressive tyrant who took joy in making his subjects suffer as revenge for his family's persecution.
Under his rule, the people of Wano suffered great famines. The officials under him also harshly enforced his regime, and he collaborated with
Kaidou
to not only kill
Kouzuki Oden
,
but also allowed the
Beasts Pirates
to turn Wano into a nearly complete wasteland in exchange for borrowing Kaidou's power and protection, disregarding his country and people in favor of his own self-interest. Due to his power and connections, he was completely fearless and arrogant, proclaiming that he did not fear the
Celestial Dragons
nor the
Marines
. He even shot a
CP0
agent, confident that they could do nothing against him.
This arrogance blinded him to the fact that he was in truth just a pawn for Kaidou and that Kaidou only protected him as long as it suited his own interests. Even as Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates turned Wano into a wasteland, Orochi expected that the Flower Capital would remain prosperous and was shocked when Kaidou revealed his intentions of using it to make more factories. He defiantly opposed Kaidou's
New Onigashima Project
by reprimanding him for his ingratitude, all while clearly forgetting the fact that he had completely relied on Kaidou's power for protection.
Orochi's twisted pride in his tyranny, dancing in delight amidst the false laughter of his citizens.
Although he hated his country, Orochi desired to create an image of him being a heroic and strong ruler with a happy populace. During his reign, he had schools teach propaganda about him being the one to defeat Oden and maintain the country's isolation when, in reality, Kaidou was the one who did those things.
When meeting with
CP0
, he claimed that the citizens around them were happy, although this reality only existed in the wealthy Flower Capital.
To give the impoverished citizens the facade of happiness, Orochi put defective
SMILE
fruits in their food supply to render them unable to express negative emotions.
Orochi was an extremely domineering and unreasonable man with absolutely no tolerance to anyone who defied or spoke ill of him, even if it was out of his earshot and in casual discussion. He made those actions a capital crime, which the
Gifters
enforced.
Orochi was petty enough to kill any man, woman or child who offended him, going to any lengths to see them dead (only showing temporary hesitation towards a woman he held feelings for) and refused to take responsibility for the consequences of his own actions, preferring to blame others instead by branding them as criminals.
Orochi had an extremely murderous mindset, becoming angry if a target escaped from his wrath and would send countless subordinates or even
assassins
to deal with individuals he wanted gone, no matter how threatening they may be, as well as those that protect or assist said individuals.
The subordinates that fail to uphold his rule are callously discarded from his ranks and then punished accordingly.
Orochi enjoys splurging on banquets.
Orochi was also immensely extravagant and hedonistic, as he loved to hold banquets with luxurious
food
and
drinks
accompanied by refined music and dancing. He was picky with his choice of food and extremely wasteful.
Moreover, he employed only the finest geisha of Wano, such as
Komurasaki
, to perform at his banquets.
Komurasaki in particular was the main target of Orochi's affections, with the latter wishing to make the former his bride. Orochi's feelings for Komurasaki, however, were very shallow since he only loved her due to beauty. He thought of himself as the only one with the right to have her as a result of his pride and possessiveness.
Orochi suffering from paranoia.
Though arrogant, Orochi avoided being totally overconfident out of fear, as he was a coward by nature. As a highly cautious and attentive man, he took any and all threats to his rule seriously. To this extent, he prohibited the use of weapons and banned all martial arts dojos to deprive any dissidents of the means to incite a rebellion.
Orochi also acknowledged the fact that the
Nine Red Scabbards
and
Momonosuke
survived, believing his
information sources
and the fact that their bodies were never found. His warnings about the return of the Kouzuki retainers caused many of his complacent servants to view him as a coward, merely overreacting out of fear for Toki's prophecy.
Though his servants were often afraid to voice this skepticism out loud, Orochi was aware of the fact that he was thought of as paranoid, but overlooked this due to having the authority to have his commands carried out regardless.
Orochi remained resolute in his refusal to release the prisoners in Rasetsu Town despite Yasuie convincing people that everything was a result of Orochi's mistake,
going as far as imprisoning their families alongside them if they attempted to protest.
Ironically, while he was careful with the Kouzuki Family and the rebels, Orochi could be too trustful as he never suspected his subordinate Kyoshiro of being affiliated with either the Kouzuki Family or the rebels and never expected Kaidou's betrayal.
Despite his usual cautious attitude, Orochi could make rash decisions in the heat of the moment as he was willing to execute
Yasuie
in a public demonstration, without taking into account the latter's popularity with his citizens and the potential to arouse their dissatisfaction by killing him.
According to
Hyougoro
, despite all the precautions Orochi took to minimize the chances of his own downfall, he had failed to notice the great flaw in his policy of condemning all his dissidents to life imprisonment in
Udon
, which allowed hatred to breed among tens of thousands of people for over two decades.
Having lived in safety and protection for twenty years with the help of the Beast Pirates and his countless subordinates such as the
Kyoshiro Family
,
Mimawarigumi
, and the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
, Orochi sometimes lost all sense of danger. When Zoro attacked him, Orochi was deeply shocked that someone had actually tried to kill him despite his authority and power as the
shogun
.
Orochi's unexpected complacency also led him to miscalculate the distances of the regions of Wano due to having spent all his time in the Flower Capital as he acted too late in stopping the rebels from gathering.
After being betrayed by Kaidou and having his delusional pride and glory as the shogun completely insulted and humiliated by the latter taking all of his forces through an ultimatum, with the Mimawarigumi and Orochi Oniwabanshu (with the exception of Fukurokuju) pledging loyalty towards Kaidou instead of punishing the latter for decapitating him, Orochi went insane due to his excessive arrogance and anger, hell bent on taking revenge on his former benefactor for his treachery. He still retained enough reason to know that it was impossible to attack Kaidou himself due to the latter's power thus he resorted to arson, setting fire to Onigashima's residence knowing that it would be impossible for the Beast Pirates to escape due to Kaidou levitating the island, though he seemed to forget the fact he was also trapped on the floating island himself. While he believed he could have safely fled the flying island with Fukurokuju's help, he recklessly started his plan to destroy Onigashima and everyone on before getting off himself.
He had a habit of using the phrase "Don't be reserved!"
(
くるしゅうない
,
Kurushūnai
?
)
, an expression used in historical context by people of high social status in response to their servants.
Like other characters, Orochi possessed a
unique laugh
: "Gufufufufu".
He also used the variations "Gufuhahaha"
(
ぐふはははは
?
)
and "Guhoho"
(
ぐほほ
?
)
.
Relationships
Family
Orochi was angry that the entire
Kurozumi Family
, himself included, was persecuted and hunted down just because of the heinous actions of his grandfather.
With help from distant relatives
Kurozumi Higurashi
and
Kurozumi Semimaru
, he obtained power and took control of Wano. Despite wanting to avenge his family, Orochi cares very little for his remaining relatives, being unconcerned with Higurashi's death despite her support, as he did not express any concern over Kaidou killing her.
He also didn't care (or at least didn't know) that other members of his family were suffering under his reign, resulting in
Tama
becoming a orphan at age 4.
Kurozumi Kanjuro
He implored an orphan
Kanjuro
, whose parents were similarly slaughtered, into his services to spy on Oden. With nothing else to live for, Kanjuro loyally followed Orochi's instructions to the point that he was willing to die to play the role. Although he found Kanjuro's loyalty to be excessive to the point of disturbing, Orochi saw him as extremely trustworthy as was willing to vouch for him to Kaidou.
When they met for the first time since his return, Orochi was pleased to see him bring Momonosuke to him. He wanted to offer Kanjuro a drink for his assumed success but became extremely worried and displeased to hear from Kanjuro that their plan had failed to prevent the rebellion. He also did not hesitate to sacrifice Kanjuro when necessary, but not before giving him one final mission to destroy Onigashima and kill everyone on it.
Allies
Subordinates
Orochi had many subordinates in
Wano
, including the
Kyoshiro Family
, a yakuza gang. While all his men appeared to be fiercely loyal to him, they did not have a lot of respect for him as a person. Whenever Orochi brought up the prophecy about the
Kouzuki Family
, his underlings generally did not take him seriously though they tried not to laugh about his paranoia, knowing that they would be executed for laughing at his cowardice. They also talked about him behind his back, such as when
Kyoshiro
called him a coward.
Despite mocking him, they all watched in shock and horror as Kaidou disposed of him. However, when given the choice to join Kaidou or die, they quickly pledged their loyalty to Kaidou for self preservation instead of opposing him on Orochi's behalf, showing that they had no conviction for Orochi.
However, although
Fukurokuju
, the head of the Oniwabanshu, did pledge allegiance to Kaidou after Orochi's apparent death, the ninja then went on to reunite with Orochi and aid him in his quest for revenge against the Beasts Pirates.
Enemies
Kouzuki Family
Orochi developed an extreme hatred of the Kouzuki Family due to them having an unintentional role in his family's suffering, and desires to wipe out the entire bloodline completely more than anything. After coming to power, Orochi criminilized the Kouzuki bloodline by branding them as traitors for attempting to open Wano's borders.
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
The birth of Sukiyaki completely derailed the Kurozumi Daimyo's plan to take control of Wano, which later led to the Kurozumi falling out of power. Because of this, Orochi hated Sukiyaki for ever being born in the first place, believing that if he hadn't, then he would've eventually become the next
shogun
by succession. With Higurashi's help, Orochi was able to get close enough to secretly remove Sukiyaki and then usurp his position as shogun and later imprison him.
Kouzuki Oden
Oden first met Orochi when he was 13 and still working for Yasuie. He did not think highly of Orochi, calling him a creep when he first saw him and frequently noting his pathetic disposition.
When Oden became a daimyo, Orochi frequently asked to borrow money from him, and Oden always obliged despite never being paid back due to feeling sorry for Orochi and respecting his relationship with Yasuie.
Orochi approached Oden humbly, but in reality considered him to be an enemy, as he was actively working to overthrow the Kouzuki Family from the shogunate and rule in Oden's place, and was spending the money Oden gave him to manufacture weapons.
When Oden returned from his voyage and found out that Orochi had not only seized the throne but had his allies attack Toki and Momonosuke, he instantly became enraged and attempted to slay Orochi.
With Orochi's allies preventing Oden from killing him, Orochi put aside pretenses and treated Oden antagonistically, revealing in the trickery he had used to remove the Kouzuki Family from power. He took full advantage of his power over Oden by forcing him to humiliate himself in public and to grovel in his presence. Oden felt shocked and aghast at how the Kurozumi Family was unjustly persecuted for the actions of Orochi's grandfather and he did what Orochi said in the hopes of preventing him from offering innocent people as tribute for the Beasts Pirates.
After executing Oden, Orochi portrayed him to the public as a threat to Wano.
Kouzuki Hiyori/Komurasaki
Orochi originally used to be in love with
Komurasaki
and desired to make the woman his.
However, as Orochi attacked
Toko
, Komurasaki slapped him, which infuriated Orochi.
Because of her beauty, Orochi gave her a chance to beg for mercy, but she refused, causing him to attack in a fit of rage. However, Orochi was furious when Kyoshiro struck her down on his behalf.
After Komurasaki was presumably murdered, Orochi fell into immense sorrow and depression, crying nonstop in mourning to the extent of lashing out at
Fukurokuju
for interrupting him and harboring a grudge against Kyoshiro for killing her.
When he later met her again during the raid on Onigashima in a room, he could not hold back, bursting into tears, telling her he could not stop dreaming about her, to which she replied to never leave his side again, letting his emotions overtake him.
Unknown to Orochi, Komurasaki is actually Kouzuki Hiyori, the daughter of his most hated enemy, Oden. She is shown to be disgusted by Orochi's cruelty, tearfully saying that his most heinous crime is putting the poor into so much misery and taking away their ability to express sorrow.
Also, she expressed her desire to kill Orochi with her own hands.
However even Orochi starts growing impatient while waiting for Fukurokuju, with not even Komurasaki's music being able to calm him down. He starts demanding she take off her mask so he can see if she is real or a ghost, but some of the ceiling crashes down on him. While trapped under the debris, Orochi realizes he cannot transform, with Komurasaki revealing it was because she stuck a
Seastone
nail in him while she was playing. Orochi is outraged by her action as he asks her if she loved him, but she coldly replies that she never bore any love toward him. She then tells him that it is poetic that his favorite song is "Moon Princess" which was her father's favorite too. It is then that Hiyori reveals her true identity to a horrified Orochi, and that she wore the mask so she could avoid smiling for him while playing it.
Orochi pleaded for his life, attempting to claim he was just a pawn of Kaidou's and that he always respected Oden, claiming he will honor Oden's legacy if Hiyori spared him. However, Hiyori wasn't fooled, reminding him of how he and Kaidou deceived her father into dancing like a fool and revealing her utter contempt for Orochi, who she sees as an honorless coward and cruel tyrant who hurt the people of Wano. Orochi then reveals his true colors when
Kazenbo
appears, ordering it to kill Hiyori with its fire. However his plan literally backfires when Kazenbo accidentally lights Orochi himself on fire, as Hiyori disdainfully watches.
When the Seastone nail was later dislodged from his body, aware of how badly injured he is, Orochi decided to murder Hiyori so she could go down with him, in his final act to spite Oden,
but was stopped by Denjiro.
Nine Red Scabbards
Out of all the Kouzuki rebels, excluding Kanjuro, Orochi is deathly fearful of the Nine Red Scabbards the most, when they successfully escaped with Oden's sacrifice, Orochi shivered in fear nonstop demanding his subordinates to present their corpses for relief and is absolutely cautious and vigilant of them for twenty years even with Kaidou's protection. When Kouzuki Toki gave a prophecy to Wano, Orochi correctly interpret her prophecy that the Nine Red Scabbards will exact vengeance on him in Oden's name. When Kanjuro gave Orochi intel on their movements and plans, Orochi proudly proclaimed they will never succeed in their revenge as he sent a large fleet of the Beast Pirates to kill Kin'emon, Raizo, Ashura, Inuarashi and Kikunojo after seemingly foiled the rebel alliance's gathering. Orochi completely enjoyed the Fire Festival banquet in Onigashima to his heart's content after the Beast Pirates seemingly exterminated the Nine Red Scabbards. Unfortunately, due to Kin'emon's luck in misinforming Kanjuro as well as Denjiro's deception, Orochi failed to foil the Nine Red Scabbards' revolution plan which caused him immense fear and panic when Kanjuro informed him. After Kaidou betrayed and decapitate him, Orochi met Kin'emon and the Nine Red Scabbards face to face for the first time in twenty years, now deprived of Kaidou's protection, Orochi began to panic, but he put on a brave facade mocking them for being deceived by Kanjuro, ironically despite being cautious of them for twenty years, Orochi underestimated them from their injuries by Kaidou and tried to kill them himself only to be ruthlessly decapitated.
Denjiro
After Oden's death,
Denjiro
pretended to be Orochi's ally under the guise of "Kyoshiro", the head of the
Kyoshiro Family
. Orochi thought highly of him and his connections, as he praised him during his banquet about the use of force against enemies. After Kyoshiro "killed"
Komurasaki
, Orochi was furious, though Kyoshiro stated that someone who disrespects the shogun must be punished.
Even long after her "death", Orochi was still enraged at his actions but did appreciate him holding the execution of
Shimotsuki Yasuie
on the same day.
Denjiro, on the other hand, held nothing but an immense hatred for Orochi for his role in Oden's death. When he bowed to Orochi as Kyoshiro, it made him feel really disgusted for it. Kyoshiro had no qualms in speaking badly about Orochi behind his back, calling him a coward. Because of his blind trust for Kyoshiro, Orochi left him in charge of the capital, which proved to be a huge error as it put Kyoshiro in a position to free the rebels who were imprisoned in the Flower Capital. When Orochi learnt about Kyoshiro's true identity, he admitted he was shocked.
Denjiro later stopped Orochi from murdering Hiyori in the Treasure Depository Room of Onigashima by cutting off the final head of Orochi's beast form.
Shimotsuki Yasuie
41 years ago, Orochi was a servant for
Yasuie
and would act subservient to his master. However, while Yasuie gave Orochi a career and residence, Orochi ungratefully stole money from his master while attempting to blame it on Oden, in order to fund his own attempt to take over Wano Country. Orochi never told Yasuie of his lineage of the
Kurozumi Family
until working with
Kurozumi Higurashi
,
disguised
as
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
, to take over the position of Shogun. Yasuie reprimanded his former servant for denying him such information.
Back when Orochi obtained the status of shogun, he gave Yasuie the chance to serve under him. He and the remaining daimyos refused and tried to fight back only to be defeated by Kaidou.
Upon learning that Yasuie was still alive, Orochi was furious and wanted to make an example out of him by executing him in front of the entire country.
Yasuie on his part harbors scathing hatred for Orochi's cruel reign and ruining the country through his greed. As a final act of defiance, Yasuie took the blame for the crescent mark on the allies as a joke and to humiliate Orochi as a coward in front of his men and the citizens. Enraged, Orochi proceeded to shoot Yasuie dead.
With the people of Ebisu Town unable to express anything other than laughter, Orochi made a mockery of Yasuie's death.
Toko
Orochi absolutely despised
Toko
for hysterically laughing at him non-stop during his banquet when Orochi cautioned his associates about the return of the Kouzuki Family, humiliating him in front of others for his perceived cowardice (ironically partly due to him feeding her a failed
SMILE
, which led her unable to express any emotions aside from laughter as well as her happy-go-lucky nature). He mercilessly tried to kill her despite Komurasaki's pleas over her being a child, and when Komurasaki was seemingly killed by Kyoshiro for defiance in Toko's defense, Orochi developed tremendous hatred for Toko, blaming her as the main cause for the death of the woman whom he is hopelessly infatuated. After Toko was able to escape, Orochi refused to let her live and hired
Kamazo
to hunt and kill her.
When he saw Toko again at
Rasetsu Town
, he still cursed her for Komurasaki's supposed death and wasted no time trying to kill her. He was further angered to learn that she was
Yasuie
's daughter.
Dissidents
Orochi had countless dissidents, most prominently Hyougoro and his fellow yakuza bosses.
Orochi had countless dissidents who were against his despotic rule, mainly samurai who were former retainers and allies of the Kouzuki Family.
Orochi sadistically mocked the Kouzuki rebel army's devastation while being safeguarded by Kaidou.
After Oden's death, countless samurai led by the Kouzuki damiyos rose to rebel by attacking Orochi which Kaidou intervened by protecting Orochi as the latter gleefully laughed and mocked the Kouzuki rebels for their weakness as Kaidou brutally burned them with his fire breath. Those who openly defied Orochi were either sentenced to death or condemned to life imprisonment in the
Prisoner Mine
of
Udon
. Among them are
Hyougoro
and his fellow Yakuza bosses. According to Hyougoro, over ten thousand dissidents imprisoned in Udon were extremely enraged at Orochi and are fully prepared to revolt if given the right time.
Dissidents who were in hiding chose to bid their time among the Wano residents and were also prepared to rebel, but they are currently being hunted down and imprisoned in Rasetsu Town.
Luffy later persuaded all the Udon prisoners to join the rebellion, and unbeknownst to Orochi, Denjiro (under his alias Kyoshiro) would use the authority Orochi gave him to liberate the one thousand prisoners of Rasetsu Town to join him in the Kouzuki Revolution. Thus, all of Orochi's dissidents finally have the chance to gather together to overthrow Orochi.
Despite thinking of Orochi as thoroughly reprehensible, Hyougoro was nevertheless infuriated and disgusted when the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
and
Mimawarigumi
renounced their loyalty to Orochi to join Kaidou out of self-preservation after he beheaded their master.
Straw Hat Pirates
Because of his allegiance with Kaidou, Orochi was an obstacle in the Straw Hat Pirates' plot to bring the emperor down. They especially hated him after learning of his role in Oden's tragic death.
Roronoa Zoro
As a member of the Straw Hat Pirates and an ally of the Kouzuki Family, Zoro was an enemy of Orochi. After Orochi executed Yasuie, Zoro also learned from Hiyori about how Orochi fed the citizens of Ebisu Town faulty SMILE fruits to prevent them from expressing sadness over their suffering from his tyranny. Zoro developed an intense hatred towards the shogun and stood up against him when he tried to kill Toko. In a rash fit of rage, Zoro tried to attack Orochi and then went after the shogun until Kyoshiro interfered.
Kaidou
Over twenty years ago, Orochi allied with Kaidou using the money previously borrowed from Oden,
allowing his crew to take over Wano Country in order to monopolize its immense resources for their own gains in exchange for helping him overthrow the Kouzuki Family. In exchange for Kaidou's support to maintain his political authority and power, Orochi purposely sacrificed most of the territory of Wano to be used by
Kaidou
for his war preparations,
while also letting the Beasts Pirates enslave his own citizens and subjugate them to harsh labor in weapon factories, forcing them to provide the manpower required to mass-produced weapons for Kaidou's own goals. Kaidou seemed (with amusement) to regard Orochi as a sickened individual
because of his action of robbing the people of
Ebisu Town
of their ability to express sadness or anger.
Despite previously ridiculing him for his paranoia, they followed some of his orders, though some were annoyed after Yasuie made Orochi look like a fool. However, they realize he was correct when seeing some Nine Red Scabbards preparing to raid
Onigashima
.
However, Kaidou was merely using Orochi as a pawn, and once Kaidou revealed his
New Onigashima Project
, Orochi angrily objected to it, reprimanding Kaidou for his ingratitude as it was with his authority and permission that his crew can monopolize the resources and manpower of Wano for mass-producing high-quality weapons for increasing his military power. Kaidou merely responded by decapitating Orochi, claiming he never cared about him and his family's honor and prestige, effectively ending their alliance. While Kaidou and the All-Stars had no problem with betraying Orochi, the rest of the Beasts Pirates were shocked when they saw their Governor-General decapitate the shogun. Kaidou then attempted to take over the remnants of Orochi's forces, all of whom are shocked as well, by giving them the choice of submission or death.
Adding insult to his seeming demise, all of Orochi's subordinates, the Orochi Oniwabanshu and Mimawarigumi readily pledge loyalty to Kaidou as the remaining Beasts Pirates who also once revered Orochi as their leader also accepted Kaidou's betrayal against the shogun, proving that Orochi's self-proclaimed greatness and glory for twenty five years have been nothing more than a delusional farce.
Unbeknownst to Kaidou, however, Orochi had managed to survive the decapitation. He then became murderously furious towards Kaidou's treachery and humiliation to his immense pride and glory as the Shogun by stealing his authority over the Wano Country and the obedience of most of his subordinates except Fukurokuju, but is still fully aware that Kaidou is too powerful to confront personally. Thus, Orochi resorted to setting fire to Kaidou's residence in an attempt to massacre all his subordinates as revenge.
Other
World Government
Orochi had an arrogant and fearless attitude towards the
World Government
and its
military forces
. After the fall of
Doflamingo
, Orochi negotiated a weapons trade with
CP0
and took advantage of their weak position to make exorbitant requests, threatening to end their main source of high-quality weapons for the Marines. He flaunted his allegiance with Kaidou in their faces, mockingly stating that even the
World Nobles
are unable to do anything to him.
Orochi seemed to have a great interest in
Vegapunk
's scientific capabilities, as he demanded the
scientist
be brought to Wano in exchange for the next shipment of weapons.
Wano Country Citizens
Orochi was cruel toward the poor citizens of Wano and apathetic to the misery he caused.
A tyrannical and greedy ruler, Orochi held absolutely no concern for the welfare of his citizens, favoring only the rich while oppressing the poor. According to the laws he had set, only wealthy citizens could be considered
humans
, as all poor citizens were forced to live in wastelands and were allowed to eat only leftovers, which resulted in many of them dying from hunger. As for the rich citizens, he forbade them from consuming alcohol except during the Fire Festival. He had absolutely no tolerance towards citizens who dared to criticize or insult him, willing to kill Toko simply for laughing at his perceived cowardice. He also allowed most of his poor citizens to be
enslaved
by the Beasts Pirates for hard labor in their weapon factories for the sake of his own prosperity in the
Flower Capital
.
Orochi's anger as he recalled his family's persecution.
Orochi's cruelty towards the citizens stemmed from his tremendous hatred towards a majority of them for unjustly persecuting his family due to his grandfather's crimes, even though not all of them were involved in his family's execution and hunt. Having witnessed most of his family, such as his mother and Kanjuro's parents, being ruthlessly hunted down and terrorized with unreasonable violence and unfairly killed as sinners simply for being blood-related to his grandfather, had caused him to live in constant fear since childhood. Orochi even claimed that his citizens could all die without a single shred of care. He had no qualms with kidnapping hundreds of innocent citizens and threatened to deliver them to Kaidou as tribute to force Oden to surrender and endure humiliation just to spare their fate. This shows that Orochi's cruelty is absolutely indiscriminate, as he justified his tyranny to get revenge on the people of Wano for what happened to his family and him, despite the fact that not all Wano citizens were responsible for his horrible childhood.
In addition to tyrannically oppressing his citizens, Orochi was cruel to the point that he would not even allow his citizens to mourn and cry no matter how much misery he caused them due to finding their sadness and depression disgusting. Thus, he fed them faulty
SMILE
fruits to rob them of the ability to express sadness.
When the Ebisu Town residents express their devastation towards Yasuie's death in laughter, Orochi joyfully cheered and danced, claiming that Wano Country is a paradise and that his citizens are "always happy" under his rule.
Due to Orochi's horrendous tyranny, all the Wano Country citizens, including those in the Flower Capital, absolutely despised Orochi in secret, but were too afraid to oppose him due to Kaidou's protection, and they would heartily celebrate during the Fire Festival when he left for Onigashima, as it was the only moment their country was spared from his tyranny. They also secretly longed for the Kouzuki Family to return, wishing above all else for Orochi and Kaidou to be overthrown, to the point of writing their wish for this on their paper lanterns on the night of the
Fire Festival
that would take place during the raid on
Onigashima
.
Abilities and Powers
As
shogun
, Orochi had full control over
Wano Country
and its inhabitants. He had government officials working under him who enforced his rule, and had a group of elite ninja known as the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
,
as well as a squad of samurai known as the
Mimawarigumi
who served and protected him without question.
He also had the backing of
Kaidou
, formerly one of the
Four Emperors
, so if he and his subordinates were threatened, Kaidou would hear about it and deal with the threat,
which was proven in the past when Kaidou brutally ended a massive rebellion staged by countless samurai led by the daimyos serving the Kouzuki Family against Orochi's new rule. He believed that with Kaidou's support, not even the
Marines
and
Celestial Dragons
could overthrow him or topple Wano.
However, with Kaidou having betrayed and attempted to kill him, Orochi lost much of the power that came from their alliance as well as many of his subordinates.
In terms of personal combat, Orochi had very little skills to speak of, having always relied on others to protect him and fight his battles.
Tactical Skills
Orochi commands an operation to prevent the rebels from mobilizing.
Orochi had an extremely sharp intuition and a strategic cunning, as he orchestrated
Kanjuro
to infiltrate the Nine Red Scabbards as a mole. Unlike most of his complacent subordinates, Orochi took Toki's prophecy seriously, which allowed him to correctly deduce that
Oden
's
son
and
retainers
were still alive and that certain incidents around Wano Country were connected to
Kin'emon
. He wholeheartedly believed that they were planning to overthrow him and his ally Kaidou, even though there was no concrete evidence to support his suspicions.
Through his spy, Orochi received information regarding
Kouzuki Hiyori
, the
time travel
of the
Nine Red Scabbards
, and the assembly location and numbers of the enemy alliance. This allowed him to correctly figure out their plans and take effective actions to prevent them from mobilizing, by destroying the cave containing the
Thousand Sunny
and blowing up all the bridges connecting the country's regions ahead of time.
However, Orochi's efforts failed due to Kin'emon misreading Yasuie's message as well as Orochi miscalculating the distances of the regions, acting too late in stopping them.
Swordsmanship
In the Flower Capital school, Orochi was lauded as being a powerful swordsman said to utilize a sword-style known as
Orochi Two Sword Style
(
オロチ二刀流
,
Orochi Nitōryū
?
, literally meaning "Orochi Two Sword/Blade Style")
, and according to propaganda, he used this style to defeat
Kouzuki Oden
and his
retainers
.
However, this is all false information to paint him as being a powerful shogun, as it was Kaidou who defeated Oden, with Orochi not even being present during the battle.
After hearing
Toko
laughing after his raving about the
Kouzuki Family
, he used a katana to slice wildly through a thin wall while completely missing Toko, displaying little to no skill in swordsmanship.
Marksmanship
Orochi had great marksmanship skills, having been seen wielding a
flintlock pistol
and rifle. He was able to quickly draw his pistol and shoot a
CP0
agent in the head with it, although the agent was unharmed by the bullet.
With his rifle, he was able to shoot
Shimotsuki Yasuie
to death from a great distance away,
and was shown aiming directly at Toko's head when trying to shoot her.
Devil Fruit
Further information:
Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Yamata no Orochi
Orochi's Yamata no Orochi form.
Orochi ate the Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Yamata no Orochi, a
Mythical Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allowed him to transform into a full eight-headed snake and a human-eight-headed snake hybrid at will.
He primarily used this power to intimidate people.
As a Zoan user, Orochi received a boost to his physical abilities, though he was never seen using his enhanced physical capabilities in battle. In his eight-headed snake form, he was able to deal considerable damage to the room he was in and attack the people who were there with him, though it is unknown exactly how much damage the people took. He was also strong enough to easily lift up a person with just his mouth.
With his multiple heads with long necks, he had the ability to attack in multiple directions at once and reach targets that are farther away than he can normally reach. Furthermore, he was able to attack and trap his targets with his considerably strong jaws.
Perhaps the greatest benefit of this power is that it allowed Orochi to survive beheading, even in his human form,
although he had one fewer head than before.
Since his Devil Fruit gave him eight heads, decapitating Orochi did not kill him until he was subjected to it eight times.
History
Past
The Kurozumi Family attacked by lynch mobs.
Orochi lived in squalor in his youth after
his family
lost their power due to his grandfather's crimes. He and his family were also persecuted and hunted down by ruthless extrajudicial citizens out of self-righteousness, causing Orochi to live in fear.
Over time, he gained immense hatred for all the people of Wano, which extended to all those who had nothing to do with his suffering. Over 41 years ago, he was approached by
Kurozumi Higurashi
, who revealed to him how his grandfather unsuccessfully tried to become
shogun
by poisoning his fellow daimyo but was ultimately caught and forced to commit seppuku. Orochi was stunned at the possibility that he could have been the shogun and agreed to follow Higurashi's instructions to obtain the title. She told him to hoard gold and produce weapons in order to gain powerful allies, and gave him the
Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Yamata no Orochi
to eat to accomplish this goal.
Sometime later, Orochi found his relative
Kurozumi Kanjuro
, who had lost his parents due to persecution. Orochi claimed to have killed Kanjuro's parents' killers and instructed him to pose as a member of the
Kouzuki Family
until his death. Kanjuro, a skilled actor who sought death, readily agreed, and Orochi gave him a Devil Fruit to eat.
41 years ago, Orochi worked as a servant for
Shimotsuki Yasuie
.
When the shogun's son
Kouzuki Oden
departed Yasuie's residence after staying there, Orochi stole money and blamed it on Oden.
He later left Yasuie's residence himself and took the daimyo's remaining gold. Orochi then went to Kuri, where Oden ruled as daimyo. He got Oden to lend him money many times, promising to pay him back.
Around 30 years ago, Orochi went to the shogun's castle with Higurashi, who disguised herself as Oden with her
Devil Fruit powers
. She asked the shogun
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
to give Orochi a job at the castle, and Sukiyaki obliged. Sukiyaki began to fall ill,
and around 28 years before the present, the old woman posed as him and decreed that Orochi would temporarily succeed him as shogun until Oden returned from his absence.
Orochi gloats over Oden's humiliation.
By the time Oden left his wife and children in the care of his retainers 26 years ago, Orochi had joined forces with
Kaidou
and constructed weapons factories. With support from the
Beasts Pirates
, Orochi forced citizens to work in the factories and those who refused would be executed.
He also took over the shogunate's ninja squad known as the
Kouzuki Oniwabanshu
, with their leader
Fukurokuju
submitting to him.
When Oden returned to Wano a year later, he went to the Flower Capital and attacked Orochi after hearing about his oppression.
Oden's attack was stopped by
Kurozumi Semimaru
, who used a
barrier
to protect Orochi. With Oden unable to harm him, Orochi then explained how he rose to power. Orochi and Kaidou then made a deal with Oden. If Oden danced naked in the Flower Capital once a week, citizens would be spared.
They also promised to leave Wano in five years.
In the aftermath, Oden started dancing naked in the Flower Capital, causing Orochi to laugh profusely.
Five years later, Orochi had Kaidou capture the yakuza boss
Hyougoro
and kill his family due to being unable to control Hyougoro. He then traveled to Kuri to inform Oden that he would be building weapons factories in the region and told him about what had happened to Hyougoro.
On the day of Oden's execution, Orochi was present at the execution site to witness the execution. Orochi did not object to Kaidou's deal with Oden to allow those who survive the boiling pot for
one hour
go free. During the execution, Orochi was displeased that Oden was holding his retainers above him with a piece of wood, but Kaidou did not mind.
After the citizens found out about the deal between Oden and Orochi from five years ago, Orochi ignored their pleas. Even though Oden successfully survived one hour, Orochi decided to execute him and his retainers with a firing squad. As the Scabbards fled, Orochi watched as Kaidou shot Oden in the head.
Before her death,
Kouzuki Toki
cursed Orochi, which he interpreted as a prophecy that the Kouzuki Family would get revenge on him in 20 years.
As his subordinates were unable to find any corpses of the Nine Red Scabbards, Orochi became restless.
He approached the four other daimyo of Wano and gave them the choice to join him or die. All of them refused and staged a rebellion with a massive samurai army to attacked Orochi but were defeated by Kaidou.
A few years before
Momonosuke
's return, Orochi mixed faulty
SMILE
fruits with the leftovers from the
Flower Capital
and fed them to the residents of leftover towns, robbing the poor of their ability to express anger or sadness.
After the
Kid Pirates
were captured by Kaidou, Orochi offered
Killer
a chance to save his captain by giving him a SMILE fruit.

Second Act
Orochi dominates a trade deal with the World Government.
Orochi planned to throw a banquet, and an aide reported that the courtesan
Komurasaki
was on her way, which made him excited as he planned to make her his wife.
Orochi then held an audience for
CP0
, who wished to use him as a new medium for their trade with Kaidou. Delighted by the amount of power he held in this situation, Orochi demanded that they bring him Dr.
Vegapunk
next time. When one of the agents protested, Orochi shot him and reminded him that he had no fear of the
World Government
thanks to Kaidou's protection. Orochi then went to his banquet, where he celebrated with Komurasaki and his guests.
Orochi attacks Komurasaki for standing up to him.
Orochi listened to Komurasaki playing her shamisen before seeing the new geisha
O-Robi
and telling her to come talk to him. When he overheard his money changer
Kyoshiro
talking about avenging
his comrades
, Orochi expressed his agreement and took the opportunity to warn his guests about Toki's prophecy and the impending Kouzuki Family rebellion. However, he then heard Komurasaki's kamuro
Toko
laughing at him and immediately rushed to attack her despite Komurasaki's pleas. Orochi swung his sword at Toko, but was then slapped by Komurasaki, who refused to apologize.
Orochi transformed into the Yamata no Orochi and tried everything he could to avoid killing Komurasaki, but eventually went and wrested her into his main mouth. However, the ceiling suddenly fell on his head and dislodged Komurasaki from his mouth, and to Orochi's shock, Kyoshiro struck her down. This made Orochi very angry, and he resumed rampaging after Toko, but was then suddenly struck by a thunderbolt from the intruder
Nami
.
The next day, Orochi discovered that a secret message was being passed around loyalists to the Kouzuki Family and ordered the mass arrests of anyone with the crescent moon symbol on their ankle.
He also sent his assassin
Kamazo
after Toko.
The next day, Orochi found out that Kamazo had failed, and he had him sent to the Prisoner Mines for the Beasts Pirates to do what they liked with him.
Fukurokuju
then reported to Orochi that they had captured Ushimitsu Kozo, but Orochi was in no mood to hear about it as he continued mourning the loss of Komurasaki. Fukurokuju revealed that Ushimitsu Kozo was
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, and Orochi ordered for his execution to be broadcast, to which Kyoshiro revealed that the equipment was already set up for Komurasaki's funeral. Orochi gleefully planned for both of them to be disposed of together.
Orochi prepares to execute Yasuie.
As Orochi was brought to Yasuie's execution platform in Rasetsu Town, he heard the former daimyo insult him and became enraged. Orochi and his guards then shot Yasuie and killed him,
and as Orochi reached the execution platform, he relished in the false laughing of the crowd mourning Yasuie. Orochi then saw Toko at Yasuie's body and made his way to shoot her, but his shots were blocked by
Roronoa Zoro
and
Sanji
.
Orochi ordered his samurai to kill the duo but froze as Zoro sent a deadly air slash toward him, though it was intercepted by Kyoshiro. Orochi was taken back to his castle on Kyoshiro's orders, and he told his subordinates to kill everyone who stood against him.
Later, Orochi was furious to hear that the Straw Hats escaped. However, Fukurokuju informed the shogun that the Flower Capital was on lockdown with the Orochi Oniwabanshu and the
Mimawarigumi
on guard. He reassured that he would not let anything harm Orochi until they captured their enemies.
On the day before the Fire Festival, Orochi received some reports from Kanjuro. He learned about the
alliance
's plans and that Kouzuki Hiyori is still alive and hiding in Ringo.
Third Act
During the night, Orochi ordered the Beasts Pirates to destroy the bridges connecting Wano's regions to prevent the rebels from gathering at their meeting place.
On the next day, he traveled to Habu Port with his entourage and boarded a ship for Onigashima.
At the island, he enjoyed the celebration in the company of women from the Beasts Pirates.
Orochi is beheaded by Kaidou.
While enjoying the celebration with Kaidou, Orochi was pleased when Kanjuro delivered Momonosuke to him. However, he was met with disappointing news that the plot to stop the Kouzuki rebellion had failed. Despite Fukurokuju's assurances, Orochi would not be satisfied unless he received reports of the complete destruction of his enemies.
He then tied Momonosuke to a crucifix and proudly put him on display at the Performance Floor in the Skull Dome.
Orochi proceeded to explain to the Beasts Pirates how Momonosuke escaped to the future on the day of Oden's death, before Kaidou arrived at the stage to announce the "New Onigashima" project.
Kaidou went on to explain his plan, which involves him taking full control and transforming Wano Country into a paradise for pirates and making all of its citizens its slaves, including those in the Flower Capital. As Orochi objected, stating that the Flower Capital was his territory, Kaidou promptly and unceremoniously decapitated him.
The Nine Red Scabbards synchronously cut off six of Orochi's heads.
Despite being presumed dead by nearly everyone who witnessed his decapitation, Orochi survived due to his Devil Fruit ability and was rejoined by Fukurokuju. Deciding to slaughter everyone in the Skull Dome to get revenge, Orochi lit a fire to engulf the castle as Fukurokuju took care of any pirates they encountered.
However, they then ran into the Nine Red Scabbards who had at that point sustained significant injures after fighting Kaidou. Fukurokuju offered to deal with them, but Orochi believed he could take them on in their weakened state as he taunted them about Kanjuro, noting also the defection of Kyoshiro who was in reality the Scabbard Denjiro. Orochi transformed into his Yamata no Orochi form and prepared to devour the Scabbards, but they swiftly proceeded to cut off six of his heads with synchronized slashes, causing his body to collapse and lie motionless on the ground.
Despite losing seven of his eight heads, Orochi survived once again and snuck through the castle. He peeked out a window and witnessed
Inuarashi
defeat
Jack
.
Orochi later took shelter inside the castle and contacted Kanjuro, whom he congratulated and praised for his performance as a spy. He ordered Kanjuro to send one final painting to the basement in order to incinerate their family's burial crypt; however, Orochi knew that the basement actually contained an armory full of weapons that would destroy the island if detonated. After Kanjuro's Kazenbo began moving through the castle and burning everybody and everything it touched along the way, Orochi wanted Fukurokuju to join him so they could leave.
When he heard a shamisen playing, wondering who would do such thing during a raid, he was in complete shock to discover that next to his room Komurasaki was alive and playing the shamisen, bursting into tears by seeing her again,
laying down next to her, wondering if he was dreaming or if it was reality. Deeply in his thoughts and growing impatient about Fukurokuju's delay of their withdrawal, he requested Komurasaki play the song he loved after she asked if something was on his mind.
As the floating island was rocked by damage caused by several battles, Orochi lost his patience and cursed Fukurokuju for failing to arrive, before directing his frustration towards Komurasaki for continuing to play her shamisen and keep her face concealed beneath a mask. Suddenly, the ceiling collapsed and left Orochi trapped beneath the rubble, struggling to free himself and confused by his inability to transform into his Yamata no Orochi form. Komurasaki then revealed to Orochi that she had planted a
Seastone
nail on him while he was distracted in order to neutralize his
Devil Fruit
powers. A bewildered Orochi asked her why she would do such a thing if she loved him, to which she responded coldly that she despised him, and that the song Orochi loved hearing her play was actually the favorite of her father, Kouzuki Oden, and that now she could never play it while smiling, causing Orochi to react with shock and fear.
Orochi immediately began insisting his innocence to the daughter of Oden, claiming he was being used by Kaidou all along and pleading for her to remove the nail she had planted on him. Komurasaki told him that his word meant nothing to her, given his long history of betraying others, including her father, who had kept his end of the deal with Orochi and Kaidou for five years despite the humiliation and suffering inflicted upon him, including ultimately being executed, believing it would ultimately lead to the freedom of Wano's people. Orochi began trying to bargain with Komurasaki before she let her mask fall to the ground, telling him to silence himself and revealing her true name to be Kouzuki Hiyori. As she told Orochi how shameful and horrible he was as a shogun, Orochi once again tried to beg for her to spare his life.
Denjiro beheads Orochi for the eighth and final time.
Kanjuro's Kazenbo, having been reduced to a wisp of its former self, arrived to announce it had failed in its task. Orochi ordered Kazenbo to burn Hiyori, but the fire ghost instead chose to embrace Orochi, setting him alight.
Luffy and Kaidou's battle shook all of Onigashima and dislodged the Seastone nail from Orochi, which restored his ability to transform. Still on fire, Orochi tried to kill Hiyori in his final act to spite Oden,
but Denjiro arrived and beheaded Orochi's remaining head one last time.
However, even when reduced to a burning head, Orochi's hatred kept him alive. With his final breath, he announced to Hiyori that his family's grudge would haunt Wano forever. In response, Hiyori pointed her fan at him and declared, "Kurozumi was born to burn." Finally, Orochi succumbed to the fire and disappeared causing his definitive death.
Post-Mortem
Even after Orochi's demise, the fire that he had started grew completely out of control, threatening everyone on the island. Luckily, Raizo
released
a massive amount of water that he had acquired from his time on
Zou
, which
Jinbe
used to put out the flames. At the same time,
Luffy
defeated Kaidou while Momonosuke safely landed
Onigashima
next to the
Flower Capital
.
After the great battle was over, Momonosuke then revealed himself to the citizens of Wano, taking his rightful place as the true shogun of Wano Country and undoing all of Orochi's despotism.
