Big Pan
is the largest former member of the
Foxy Pirates
and a
combatant
of the Groggy Monsters. He is a
wotan
, a half
fish-man
(
loach
fishman
) half
giant
breed.
Due to his actions, he is a major antagonist during the
Long Ring Long Land Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Big Pan is a gigantic Wotan that towers over the other Foxy Pirates. From his fish-man half, he has slippery mudfish skin, sharp teeth, and an orange dorsal fin. From his giant half, he has orange hair and beard, and incredible size. He is however much smaller than a regular giant.
He generally wears yellow swim briefs, boots, and gloves together with a Foxy Pirate mask. During Groggy Ring matches, he wears the strap-on ball.
Personality
[
]
Despite his great size, Big Pan is somewhat deaf and a bit slow witted. Like his fellow Groggy Monsters, he laughs at many minor things. During Groggy Ring matches however, Big Pan is a brutal monster that gives his opponents no quarter. Like the rest of the Foxy Pirates, Big Pan is not above cheating and exploiting loopholes.
Relationships
[
]
As a member of the Groggy Monsters, Big Pan has a strong camaraderie with his two teammates. Being just as slow-witted as them, he gets along with them very well. Because of this, Big Pan works very well with them in any endeavour, whether it be working together to perform a team attack on an enemy or cheating together while the referee "unfortunately" looks away.
Abilities and Powers

The Groggy Monsters with the weapons to make a Monster Burger.
Being born of two races, Big Pan has the abilities of both to a certain degree. From his giant heritage, he has great size and strength. From his fish-man heritage, he has the abilities of an underwater creature, the creature in question being a pond loach, which makes Big Pan's skin extremely slippery and thus resistant to blunt physical attacks. While his skin gives him great defense against most blunt attacks, he is however vulnerable to bladed attacks.
While Big Pan is a formidable foe by himself, his greatest strength comes from the great teamwork he has with fellow Groggy Monsters. Together, they are capable of performing seemingly flowing combo attacks that can easily overwhelm any opponent.
Weapons
[
]
As a member of the Foxy Pirates, Big Pan as well is not above using underhanded tactics. In the Groggy Ring, whenever the referee "unfortunately" looks the other way, he and his fellow Groggy Monsters don illegally concealed weapons. In Big Pan's boots, he has concealed spikes which he can use to crush opponents. Along with these, Big Pan uses an axe and a pair of gigantic pans when the referee is not looking. The latter of these are his most devastating weapons.

Monster Burger
(

History
[
]
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Long Ring Long Land Arc
[
]
During the
Davy Back Fight
with the
Straw Hats
, Big Pan and the rest of the Groggy Monsters were asked specifically by
Foxy
to participate in the Groggy Ring portion of the games. They were to go against
Zoro
and
Sanji
with Sanji being the Straw Hats' ball. Following their tried and true strategy, Big Pan became the ball for his team. As the match began, Big Pan was slightly taken off guard by Sanji. Thanks to his mudfish skin however, Big Pan was able to evade the chef's attack. Having gotten Sanji stuck trying to balance on his slippery skin, Big Pan passed the Straw Hats' ball flying into their goal. With his teammates, Big Pan worked together with them in passing Sanji while giving Zoro a hard time. While their teamwork was superb, their fabled maneuvers were for the first time countered as the two Straw Hats narrowly escaped from losing the match.
Though his teammates were momentarily knocked out by the two Straw Hats, Big Pan continued fighting against his opponents. With the referee "conveniently" looking the other way, Big Pan took out some weapons to use against the Straw Hats. After dealing with the two long enough, his teammates came back into the game armed with some weapons. With the referee "conveniently" not looking once again, Big Pan and his teammates used these weapons in conjunction with their teamwork to inflict some serious damage on their opponents. Having made a triumphant comeback with this, the crowd cheered on for the Groggy Monsters.

Despite their severe thrashing of their opponents however, the two Straw Hats got back up to everyone's surprise. With this development, Foxy ordered a Monster Burger from Big Pan and his teammates. Pulling out concealed weapons while the referee "conveniently" looked in another direction, they decided to do their most vicious combo attack. Unfortunately, the two Straw Hats had decided to work together properly against the Groggy Monsters. With the two Straw Hats working together not only did Big Pan accidentally flatten Hamburg, but he himself was accidentally sliced up by Pickles.
As Big Pan started to fall from this accident, he was then completely immobilized by a kick to the back from Sanji. Propped up by this attack, Big Pan was then dunked straight into the goal by Zoro through a combo technique with Sanji. With this, Big Pan and his two teammates lost for the first time in the Groggy Ring.
After the Straw Hat Pirates won the Davy Back Fight, Big Pan and the rest of the
Foxy Pirates
gathered while their opponents decided whom to take. He and his crew were shocked when Luffy picked to take their
Jolly Roger
. The Foxy Pirates were appalled by the replacement Jolly Roger that Luffy painted for them, but Big Pan celebrated the end of the games with the rest of his crew nonetheless. They sailed off as Foxy vowed to get revenge of Luffy and his crew.
Sometime during the timeskip Big Pan along with the vast majority of his crewmates left the Foxy Pirates for unknown reasons.
