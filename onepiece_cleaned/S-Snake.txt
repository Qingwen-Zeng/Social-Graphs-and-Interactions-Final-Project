S-Snake
is one of the
Seraphim
and a
clone
of
Boa Hancock
.
Due to her actions and role, she is a supporting antagonist in the
Egghead Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
S-Snake resembles Hancock as a child, but with the same hairstyle and earrings as the adult Hancock, and is also significantly larger in size. While she shares an appearance with the adult
Kuja
, as a seraphim she also possesses
lunarian
traits, such as brown skin, black wings, and white hair. She has  yellow eyes with star-shaped pupils.
Several characters consider her appearance "cute", a trait that helps her in combat. She wears a simple white dress and black DOM shoes.
A section of her right upper arm is replaced by a tube that is filled with
Green Blood
.
Personality
[
]
Despite being a
Pacifista
, S-Snake expresses a considerable amount of personality. She has been shown to become easily flustered when praised.
She gets angry when her opponents manage to attack her and feigns vulnerability in order to make them drop their guard. She also utilizes her cuteness to charm her opponents in order to make effective use of her ability.
According to
Jinbe
, he considers S-Snake nicer than the original Hancock, though this may have been his sense of humor over meeting her clone.
Like the original Hancock, S-Snake has the same feelings of love and affection for
Monkey D. Luffy
as her genetic source. She acts very much like the real Hancock whenever she interacts with Luffy and can't turn down a request from him. This surprised Dr.
Vegapunk
since he did not program her to act like this.
In the anime, S-Snake does the same action as Hancock of "looking down" on others by leaning back and facing upward while pointing her finger.
Like all the Seraphim, S-Snake is obedient to the Pacifista authority hierarchy. However, because of her feelings towards Luffy, any request from him she will prioritize over anyone else's. That is, not even the Five Elders who should be the highest authority are able to control it as long as Luffy is present.
Abilities and Powers

S-Snake is one of the Seraphim, which Vegapunk describes as the pinnacle of his scientific achievements and the "Strongest Form of Humanity."

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
CP0 takes command of the Seraphim.
Weeks later, upon
CP0
infiltrating Egghead in order to kill Vegapunk and his satellites,
Shaka
had S-Snake, S-Hawk, and
S-Shark
deployed under the command of
Sentomaru
to combat the threat.
While
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Rob Lucci
began fighting, the three Seraphim met up with Sentomaru. The group encountered the invading government agents, leading to Sentomaru commanding both S-Hawk and
S-Shark
to hold back CP0 while S-Snake assisted the
Straw Hat Pirates
with fleeing with Vegapunk.
Obeying Sentomaru's commands, the three Seraphim were joined by
S-Bear
with assaulting the government agents, during which S-Snake directed the Straw Hats in fleeing to the Vacuum rocket with
Atlas
and
Jewelry Bonney
. Afterwards, Sentomaru succumbed to his injuries from the invasion, leading to the four Seraphim being commanded by CP0's Pacifista authority chip to cease their attack on them and begin taking orders from
Cipher Pol
.
S-Snake and the Seraphim receiving new instructions from York.
Upon CP0 infiltrating Egghead's Labophase while the Frontier Dome was deactivated, the four Seraphim took the initiative to follow the assassins. Once they arrived, Lucci ordered them to destroy Vegapunk's laboratory before the SSG could regain control over the Seraphim, leading to them damaging the building's structure using a range of attacks.
After
Stussy
subdued
Kaku
and Lucci, the attack command remained until
Edison
left the laboratory and ordered the Seraphim to cease their attack.
A while later,
York
sneaked outside the Labophase and gave new directives to the Seraphim, including killing the Straw Hats, CP0 agents and remaining satellites inside the laboratory. York also instructed S-Snake in particular to provide the former with a way to avoid suspicion through an enacted petrification later on.
S-Snake kicks aside the petrified York.
After the original Vegapunk went missing in Egghead's Labophase, S-Snake started putting York's orders in motion and assaulted
Pythagoras
during his search of the third floor at Building C, but the satellite survived and was found by
Usopp
,
Franky
,
Lilith
and
York
when they arrived to investigate. With York now present, S-Snake followed her special instructions and let York get deliberately petrified, prompting Lilith to command S-Snake to stop. Unaffected by the order due to York's own prior ones, S-Snake shot a laser at the rest of the search party.
While Usopp's group fell through the catwalk they were in, S-Snake used the opportunity to release York from stone.
S-Snake turns Usopp and Lilith to stone.
Lilith unsuccessfully tried to shoot S-Snake with her bubble gun to immobilize her, but S-Snake proved faster and easily dodged them. However, Franky managed to distract and hold one of the bubbles against her, immobilizing the Seraphim. S-Snake cunningly tricked Franky into removing the bubble by feinting pain, allowing her to counterattack and partially petrify Franky's body. She then proceeded to charm Lilith and Usopp to fully petrify them.
S-Snake then finished off Pythagoras' head, blowing it up.
After finishing her part, she flies off to her next location as per York's orders. At some point, S-Snake crossed paths with Luffy, who mistook her for the real Hancock. He asks her to undo the petrification of Franky, Usopp, and Lilith, and she does so, somehow inheriting the same love and affection the original has for him. After she and her fellow Seraphim are detained, she is thanked by both Franky and Luffy, the latter of which she mistakes as having confessed his love for her much like the original.
After
Nusjuro
bisected the clound underneath the Labophase, the Seraphim and the imprisoned Cipher Pol agents fell to the Fabiriophase.
The Seraphim remained trapped in their bubbles and were later sucked in, along with the Cipher Pol agents and pieces of rubble, by
Peter
in his giant sandworm form.
Peter later spat them all out, indiscriminately dropping them on the ships of the Marines and the
Giant Warrior Pirates
. S-Snake, still in her bubble, landed on one of the Marine ships.
S-Snake was left as one of the only people still conscious after a massive burst of
Joy Boy
's
Haki
was released by the
Iron Giant
. She attempted to wake
Pomsky
, but to no avail.
