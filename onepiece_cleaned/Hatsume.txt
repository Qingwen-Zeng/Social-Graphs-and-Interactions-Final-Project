Hatsume's concept art from the Anime.

Personality
[
]
Little is known about Hatsume's personality. She was presumably loyal to
Kurozumi Orochi
until the latter's seeming death, but had no issue with defecting to the
Beasts Pirates
afterward in spite of what the
samurai
code of honor held. She was shown with a sullen expression following this event.
She is known for never removing her mask, and apparently nobody has ever seen what's under it.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a member of the
Mimawarigumi
, Hatsume is presumably a capable
samurai
and fighter, though little of her ability has been seen.
Weapons
[
]
Hatsume wields a
katana
which has a circular guard. She was shown wielding it with just her right hand.
History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
caused violence to break out on the streets of the
Flower Capital
during the execution of
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, the
Mimawarigumi
were sent out to patrol the city.
A week later, the Mimawarigumi accompanied
Orochi
to
Onigashima
to party during the
Fire Festival
. However, Orochi would then be seemingly killed by
Kaidou
as part of Kaidou's
planned takeover of Wano
. The
Emperor
gave Orochi's subordinates the choice between pledging allegiance to him or fighting;
Hotei
immediately pledged the Mimawarigumi's support with no dissenters.
Hatsume and her allies are defeated by Hyougoro.
The festivities were then interrupted by the
invasion
of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
. However, Hatsume was later forced to fend off both friend and foe after
Queen
infected them with his
Ice Oni
virus
.
The Mimawarigumi and
Oniwabanshu
later came into conflict with the old
yakuza
boss
Hyougoro
, who had regained his former strength; Hyougoro
defeated
all of them with ease.
