Karasu (Non-Canon)
.
Karasu
is a member of the
Revolutionary Army
, serving as one of its executive
officers
and the commander of the North Army.
Appearance
[
]
Karasu is a tall, muscular, and bald man who wears half of a
plague doctor
mask on his face that acts as a loudspeaker. He wears an open dark feather coat similar to those worn by the Beast Pirates that leaves his chest exposed, dark pants, and a sash around his neck. His overall attire gives him a crow-like theme and appearance.
Personality
[
]
Karasu is an honorable man who despises those who attack the weak. He is also very quiet, and he usually communicates via inaudible mumbling, thus he needs his loudspeaker mask to be heard by others. He does not appear to take kindly to people who react negatively to his mumbling, as veins bulged on his forehead in anger when
Peachbeard
pointed it out. However, he also tends to be forgetful at times as he forgot to turn on his speaker, resulting in his mumbling.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As an executive of the Revolutionary Army, Karasu holds a powerful position within the organization. As the commander of the North Army, he has full control over all the soldiers in it.
He has been given a
bounty
of
400,000,000 showing the
World Government
sees him as a considerable threat.
He is a very capable fighter, as he fought evenly against Admiral
Fujitora
while having a territorial advantage.

Karasu ate the Susu Susu no Mi, a
Logia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into soot at will.
He commonly uses this power to mold his soot into the shape of a flock of crows, as well as breaking up his elemental body into crows.
His soot crows are able to fly at high speed and can relay information to his allies either by him speaking through them or delivering
newspapers
.
The crows can also be used in combat, able to disarm enemies en masse by snatching away their weapons or by attacking his opponents directly.
Additionally, each crow is capable of carrying an average-sized person on its back.
He can use his soot in other ways as well, such as building it into constructs. He can fly by transforming his body into soot, even without his crow wings.

Karasu fights Fujitora.
On the fourth day of the Levely, the four Revolutionary Army captains declared war by destroying the Celestial Dragons' symbol, and attacked Mary Geoise. While Saint
Pluming
fled the attack and attempted to kill his slave, Karasu saved the pirate, whom he told to flee to the east of the city. After defeating some World Government agents with his powers, Karasu told Lindbergh that they must hurry to free the slaves. There the admirals
Fujitora
and
Ryokugyu
arrived, where Karasu confronts the former. In the midst of that, he contacted Sabo, who has infiltrated
Pangaea Castle
, asking if he already got the keys to the explosive necklaces. Sabo told him that he found where they were and that he will get them soon, before talking to Lindbergh and Morley.
Soon after, inside the Pangaea Castle, Sabo gives one of Karasu's crows the keys to the explosive necklaces to give to Morley. He also told Karasu that when Kuma and all the other slaves are free, that they all go to headquarters as quickly as possible. After Sabo told him that he would go with them once he did what he had to do, Karasu wished him luck.
The raven then arrives at the plaza, where Karasu informed Morley, who was holding Kuma, that Sabo has given him the keys of the explosive collars. Therefore, Morley told him it was time to go.
The revolutionaries successfully escaped to Momoiro Island with Kuma
but were separated from Sabo.
