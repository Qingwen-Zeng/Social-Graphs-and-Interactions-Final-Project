swim briefs
, and belt, which has written the word "Alowana" on it.

Personality
[
]
His talk is very open-minded, to the ire of
Macro
, and even to
Duval
himself. Unlike most other fish-men seen in the series, Tansui and the other Macro Pirates have no qualms selling other fish-men and
merfolk
to slavery.

Past
[
]
Tansui was among the
fish-men
who joined the
Sun Pirates
and repeatedly attacked the
Marines
.
One day a former
human
slave
named
Koala
boarded their ship to return to her home in
Foolshout Island
. During her time with the Sun Pirates, Tansui,
Gyaro
, and
Macro
got attached to the girl. When she finally returned to her home, the three fish-men emotionally cried during her farewell. After Koala returned to her family, the Sun Pirates were ambushed by the Marines. The fish-men lost their ship and Tiger was badly wounded during the battle. They managed to commandeer a Marine ship, but Tiger soon died from his injuries.
After
Arlong
was later captured, the Sun Pirates was captained by
Jinbe
. When Jinbe accepted the
World Government
's offer to become a
Warlord of the Sea
, Arlong was released from prison and chose to form
his own crew
, and Macro, Gyaro, and Tansui did the same, forming the
Macro Pirates
.
The Macro Pirates turned to kidnapping
and participating in the slave market.

Several years later, the Macro Pirates reunited with
Hatchan

However, due to Hatchan thinking the map was a fake, he returned to trash the crew's ship and rescue Camie, resulting in the crew holding a grudge against the octopus fish-man.

Pappag
dove into the water, the Macro Pirates were waiting and caught them, but
