Appearance
[
]
Brûlée looks in many respects like the stereotypical witch. She is an extremely tall, slightly hunched, and gray-skinned woman with a well-endowed yet thin figure, which makes her limbs appear to be exceptionally long. She stands at roughly twice
Nami
's height (170 cm), with her legs alone being noticeably longer than said woman is overall. She also has very long, gnarled fingers with overlong, sharp nails painted blue. The woman's face has very striking, hag-like features. Her droopy eyes have yellow irises and long lashes, and are topped by viridian eye shadow and black, high-arched eyebrows, which she keeps perpetually furrowed. She has a huge and over-projected, reddish hook nose (similar to
her mother
's), a large mouth with purple lipstick that is usually seen devilishly smiling, a square jaw, and a brown, sharp-cornered scar stretching diagonally down her face from right to left. Brûlée's hair is lavender and divided into two side locks that cascade over her breasts, as well as four other, similarly long, and sharp, lock-like segments that stick to the sides, slightly curved upward.
She takes to wearing a whitish, creased gown. Its main upper section has a frilly scoop neckline, loose, flaring sleeves that are tattered at the edges, and stops quite below the waist in a frilled hemline, adorned by a horizontal row of red roses above. The lower, seemingly separate part of the dress, which begins under the upper one, falls to the ground and, too, has roses stitched onto itself in the aforementioned manner. Brûlée's clothing is completed by a feathered, sleeveless overcoat in moss green color (the latter, in addition to her grayish skin, earning her comparison to a tree by
Carrot
and to a branch by
Monkey D. Luffy
).
When she was taken to
Capone Bege
's hideout, her attire is forcefully changed into a more clean and elegant dress by the
Fire Tank Pirates
, which is also light in color, with two frilled hemlines and closer-fitting sleeves, as well as a light-colored coat above with actual sleeves and a light fur trim. Her hair was brushed into two sideward wicks.
But after being saved by Katakuri, she changed her hair back to having four locks.
As a young child, Brûlée's hair was shorter and partitioned into eight locks, and her nose was small, cone-shaped, and a paler shade of red. Her skin was also a pale beige-gray color. She wore a white short sleeve dress with flowers around the neckline.
Personality
[
]
Brûlée is prideful, as she was rather offended when
Carrot
referred to her as a talking tree
and Luffy called her a branch,
as well as when her mother sent
Charlotte Cracker
to fight the Straw Hats in her stead due to not considering her powerful enough. Brûlée is confident in her powers and claims that she could kill the
Straw Hats
in an instant, not liking to be underestimated.
Due to the terrible scar on her face, she is envious of those with alluring faces to the point that she wants to slice them up.
Her jealousy is also tempered with a very sadistic nature as shown when she intended to boil Carrot alive, Brûlée was excited in disfiguring Carrot's face with horrible burns. She scoffs at the notion of anyone succeeding against an Emperor like Big Mom, believing it to be ridiculous and impossible. She also thinks very little of the
Worst Generation
, believing their actions in the first half of the
Grand Line
were not that big of an achievement.
Like most of her siblings, Brûlée is arrogant and has the upmost pride in her crew and family. This is shown when she boasted to Luffy about Katakuri's strength and how he had never lost before. This leads her to underestimate her opponents, as she was shocked to learn that Brook managed to get copies of the Poneglyphs and hid them from Big Mom, and became devastated when Katakuri was defeated by Luffy.
Brûlée seems to share her mother's dream of creating a paradise with every race united, and finds great joy in discovering new kinds of creatures, especially animals.
However, she seems to be extremely close-minded about non-humans, as she considers
minks
to be mere animals and has no qualms about threatening to consume them, even disregarding their begging for mercy.
She also thinks very little of her mother's husbands, as she jeeringly declared her ex-stepfather,
Pound
, an enemy with no chance of returning from his actions.
She also cackled with glee when revealing that none of Big Mom's affiliates could leave her alive.
Brûlée is very loyal to her mother, as she followed her orders to keep Luffy and his group away from Sanji. She is also loyal to her family, as she went with Katakuri's plans to ambush the Straw Hats on their ship. She detests traitors, yelling angrily at
Jinbe
when she discovered him with the Sanji Retrieval Team,
as well as questioning Chiffon in her participation in her husband's plot to assassinate their mother.
She also became enraged at Pekoms for using her to assist Luffy in escaping.
Brûlée is noted by her own family to be very careless and clumsy as proven when she easily ended up getting herself captured by her enemies for them to exploit her Devil Fruit powers as shown with Chopper and Luffy.
Due to her arrogance and carelessness, Brûlée is very cowardly if she is caught in a helpless situation that would endanger her life. When Brûlée was being used by the Straw Hats and Fire Tank Pirates, she became terrified if her mother considered her a traitor and that she would be killed. When Luffy found her while he was retreating from Katakuri, Brûlée became terrified as she was taken hostage to escape the Mirro-World while pleading to Katakuri to save her. On Nuts Island, after being spotted, Brûlée pleaded for Perospero and Amande, and a deranged Big Mom to save her.
Brûlée is tricky and deceptive, using her Devil Fruit to separate Luffy from his group by disguising as him and deceiving the retrieval team, and managed to capture Carrot in the Mirro-World. Though she is not always perceptive, as she failed to notice the frog transformed into Carrot was not actually speaking and also did not piece together that the duplicate mink came from her own Devil Fruit ability.
Brûlée also seems very susceptible to tickle torture, as she easily gave Chopper and Carrot all the answers they needed when they tickled her.
Despite being usually cruel to enemies, Brûlée has a kind and caring side as she genuinely loved her family, as she was crying when the Whole Cake Chateau was falling over with her family on it.
Even as a child, she tried to comfort Katakuri, telling him not to blame himself for her brutal disfigurement by his bullies.
She also tearfully reported Katakuri's defeat at Luffy's hands to her family and crew in order to ensure that neither he nor Sanji manage to escape.
However, she was more concerned about Katakuri being hurt by Luffy rather than his loss against the latter. Brûlée cares for her brother in high regards, that she knew that Katakuri lays on his back and kept quiet about it out of respect towards him.
Like other people, Brûlée has a unique
laughing style
: "Wiwwiwwiwwi"

)
.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
As her eighth daughter, Brûlée is very loyal to
her mother
. Because of her loyalty, Brûlée followed her mother's orders in keeping Luffy from meeting Sanji.
Big Mom sent Brûlée's half-brother,
Cracker
, to assist her against both
Luffy
and
Nami
because Luffy was able to defeat
Doflamingo
.
When the Sanji Retrieval arrived at Big Mom's chamber, Brûlée attempted to shout for her mother's aid only to be gagged immediately.
Brûlée is also aware of her mother's complete ruthlessness towards her own children should they defy her
as Brûlée was terrified that she would be murdered by Big Mom if she were considered an associate of the Fire Tank Pirates in their plot to assassinate her.
Despite her fear of her mother, Brûlée cried out for her when she was falling with the collapsing chateau.
Siblings
[
]
Due to her caring nature towards her family, Brûlée appears to be on good terms with a majority of her siblings. As maternal half-siblings, Brûlée and
Charlotte Cracker
both get along very well. Even though Brûlée was annoyed that her older half-brother was sent to help her, they did cooperate in fighting Luffy and Nami.
During the many times that she was captured by the
Straw Hat Pirates
, her half-siblings,
Perospero
and
Amande
rushed to her aid when she called for help.
Oven
became enraged upon seeing
Pekoms
holding his "beloved" little half-sister, Brûlée at gunpoint and immediately saved her.
During the Vinsmoke Family's escape, Brûlée cried when her little half-sister,
Pudding
was captured by the
Blackbeard Pirates
.
However, Brûlée bears open hostility towards any traitors to the family, such as her younger half-sister,
Chiffon
, due to her joining Bege to kill their own mother, Big Mom. However, despite this hostility Brûlée has at least acknowledged Chiffon’s reasons for betraying their family as valid, as shown where she was silenced when the latter brought up the abuse she suffered under their mother. Chiffon would then tell Brûlée that her only family were Lola, Bege, and
Pez
due to the abuse she suffered at their mother's hand.
Charlotte Katakuri
[
]
After Bege's attempt to assassinate Big Mom failed,
Katakuri
saved her from being used any further by their enemies and grabbed her by her collar as he noted that the enemy had been using her a lot in their plans. Brûlée showed fear in his presence as she frantically explained that she was a hostage who had no choice, before she implored her brother to finish off their enemies.
She holds Katakuri's strength in the highest regard, as shown when she proudly bragged about it to Luffy while the Straw Hat captain was struggling in his fight against the Sweet Commander. She refers Katakuri as the Charlotte Family's greatest creation.
She also cares greatly about Katakuri as she fanatically cried when Luffy defeated him
and when she tearfully reported his defeat to her family and crew.
They were extremely close since childhood since Brûlée does not discriminate against Katakuri for his pelican eel-like mouth. Even after Katakuri's bullies took revenge by scarring her face, Brûlée did not blame Katakuri and told him he is fine just the way he is. Later, Katakuri got his revenge by attacking the bullies for scarring his sister. Brûlée also has a habit of spying on Katakuri from the Mirro-World, thus learning all of his secrets including the fact he had laid on his back, which she kept to herself out of respect for the latter. It could be said that she is the only member of her family to respect the true Katakuri rather than an idealized version of him.
Brûlée calls Katakuri affectionately as "onii-chan"
(
お兄ちゃん
?
)
,
compared to the more neutral "nii-san"
(
兄さん
?
)
she uses with Cracker.
She also called Katakuri the absolute best brother in the world, which proves the immense affection and respect Brûlée holds for him.
Allies
[
]
Kingbaum
[
]
Kingbaum
was loyal to Brûlée and respects her authority. However, when Nami pulled out Big Mom's
Vivre Card
, Kingbaum and the
Homies
stopped attacking Nami because they sensed Big Mom's soul.
Enemies
[
]
Worst Generation
[
]
Brûlée mocked the
Worst Generation
when they came to
Totto Land
. Only four known members before Luffy came:
Eustass Kid
,
Scratchmen Apoo
,
Capone Bege
, and
Urouge
.
Though Brûlée mocked the Worst Generation, she did acknowledge Urouge's achievement in defeating
one of the then Four Sweet Commanders
. However, Brûlée was proud to mention Urouge's defeat at the hands of Cracker.
Brûlée's dislike of the Worst Generation increased when she found out that Bege was really feigning loyalty and recruited Luffy in his plot to kill her mother.
Sanji Retrieval Team
[
]
On her mother's orders, Brûlée served as an adversary to the Sanji Retrieval Team and an obstacle in their efforts to rescue
Sanji
.
Due to Luffy being a part of the Worst Generation, Brûlée mocked him and the others from the same generation.
Brûlée is very antagonistic towards Nami and
Carrot
, saying that she wants to slice them because of how pretty they are.
After seeing
Chopper
's
abilities
, Brûlée took an interest in him and promised to collect him for her mother.
After she trapped Carrot and Chopper in the
Mirro-World
, she battled Nami, who managed to outwit and defeat her.
After catching Chopper and Carrot in the Mirro-World, she prepared to put Carrot in boiling soup, although this failed.
Chopper and Carrot soon forced Brûlée into guiding them through the Mirro-World and helping them find their friends.
She was angered when Luffy later used her powers to make copies of himself and destroyed the wedding cake that her mother was looking forward to.
After being freed by her brother Katakuri, Brûlée did not hesitate to stand in the Straw Hats' way of escape, determined to settle the score with them for using her.
After the Whole Cake Chateau collapsed and the Straw Hats escaped, she told her brother Katakuri to kill them for all the time they held her hostage and she made sure to hinder their escape.
She took great joy in helping her family attack the Straw Hats' ship while Big Mom was chasing them.
Unfortunately for Brûlée, she was yet again taken prisoner by Luffy, who used her to travel from island to island through the Mirro-World. After seeing Luffy defeat Katakuri, Brûlée was extremely furious.
On Cacao Island, she reported Katakuri's defeat at Luffy's hands to her family and crew in order to ensure that he and Sanji cannot escape.
While complaining to her brother, she was upset that the Straw Hats managed to escape
Totto Land
.
Pound
[
]
Brûlée made enemies with her former
step-father
and labeled him as an enemy to the
Charlotte Family
.
Jinbe
[
]
Brûlée was very enraged to see Jinbe with the Sanji Retrieval Team, saying that his actions meant betrayal to Big Mom. After Brûlée told Jinbe the true purpose of the punishment roulette wheel, she bragged that his actions would result in punishment by death, but her warning was ignored.
She was later angered when he twice listed her as a member of the group to overthrow Big Mom.
Pekoms
[
]
Pekoms captured Brûlée to use her to assist Luffy in escaping the Big Mom Pirates. Brûlée was infuriated at Pekoms' betrayal and bragged that he will be executed as a traitor.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As an officer of the
Big Mom Pirates
, Brûlée holds a high position in the crew and has authority over lower-ranking members.
Brûlée is a fairly powerful fighter, as Big Mom had enough confidence in her to prevent the Sanji Retrieval Team from escaping the Seducing Woods. She is also capable of coordinating with several homies in the forest to fight against them.
However, her family notes that Brûlée is actually very clumsy and not as strong as she perceives herself. True enough, Chopper and Carrot were able to defeat her by using her powers against her and was even captured by an exhausted Luffy when he needed to escape from his fight with Katakuri. She was also easily captured by Pekoms and held hostage.
Brûlée possesses a strong will, being able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki and remain conscious from her loud scream.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Brûlée is rather strong, as she was easily able to lift and hold
Nami
by the neck with one hand. She also uses her long and sharp fingernails to slice people.
Brûlée also has fast reflexes. She was able to dodge
Pound
's punch easily
and defend against Carrot, an extremely fast mink in her own right.
She has considerable endurance, as she was able to withstand being scalded by a giant pot of soup as well as being electrocuted by Carrot's Electro and Nami's Thundercloud Rod, then regain consciousness shortly afterwards.
Tactical Skills
[
]
She is skilled in tactics such as ambush, traps, and trickery as seen when she easily separated Luffy from the Sanji Retrieval Team, sneaked up on Nami by disguising herself as Luffy, and easily trapped Carrot, a capable mink fighter, with only minimal effort.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Mira Mira no Mi
Brûlée creates a mirror.
Brûlée ate the Mira Mira no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to create and manipulate mirrors.
She can use her mirrors to reflect attacks back at her opponents, turn any mirror into a portal to the "
Mirro-World
",
and transform herself and other living things into mirror images of different people.
By creating a mirror shield, she can provide herself with an absolute defense that not only shields her, but also reflects an opponent's attacks back at them, turning their own strength against them.
She can transform herself into a mirror image of a chosen target; while transformed into someone's reflection, she will do and say exactly whatever her target does and says, like a perfect reflection. The reverse is also true, allowing her to force the target to reflect her own words and actions.
She can even reflect other people's Devil Fruit powers.
She can also transform herself into a partial reflection, such as reflecting a person's body, but with her own face. This gives her access to that person's abilities and powers, but does not link the two to mimic each other's actions.
She has the ability to transform other living things, such as animals, into reflections as well, though these reflections are not linked to mimic the original or vice versa. This allows her to create chaos and confusion among her enemies.
The Mirro-World.
She can turn any mirror she touches into a doorway that connects the real world and her personal pocket dimension, the Mirro-World, a long tunnel filled with countless mirrors, each one connected to a counterpart mirror in the real world. Brûlée is referred to as "The Only Key to the Mirro-World"
(
鏡世界
の唯一の鍵
,
Miro Wārudo no Yuiitsu no Kagi
?
)
;
without her, the mirrors in the Mirro-World are just mirrors, though they can be used as windows to view what is on the other side of their respective real world counterparts. She can use the Mirro-World to support her allies by allowing them to travel through the Mirro-World so that they can emerge from a mirror at an advantageous location.
She can also use the Mirro-World to trap her enemies, as no one can enter or leave the Mirro-World without her.
Weapons
[
]
When she chased Chopper and Carrot inside the
Mirro-World
, Brûlée wielded a scythe.
Medical Expertise
[
]
Brûlée seems to have some medical knowledge as she tended to
Katakuri
's wounds after his defeat at the hands of Luffy.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Brûlée and
Charlotte Broyé
were born as the eighth and ninth daughters of
Charlotte Linlin
. When she was 5 years old,
some bullies whom her older brother,
Katakuri
, beat up cut her face as revenge, giving her a massive scar that she would have the rest of her life. This caused Katakuri to get his revenge on them in return and he covered his mouth to protect
his family
ever since.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[

Whole Cake Island Arc
[

Brûlée poses as Luffy's reflection.
When
Luffy
,
Nami
,
Chopper
, and
Carrot
ventured into the
Seducing Woods
in search of
Sanji
, Brûlée disguised herself as a mirrored version of Luffy and engaged in battle with the real Luffy.
When Nami, Chopper, and Carrot turned around and tried to escape, Brûlée went with them while Luffy was forced to run in the opposite direction. The
Sanji Retrieval Team
kept circling back to where they were before, before Brûlée revealed herself and grabbed Nami.
Brûlée captures Carrot inside a mirror.
Nami quickly retrieved her
Clima-Tact
and escaped Brûlée's grasp. Carrot then attempted to attack Brûlée, only for the latter to use the power of the
Mira Mira no Mi
to reflect Carrot's attack back at her. When Carrot tried to attack again, Brûlée trapped her in the
Mirro-World
, explained to Nami and Chopper that
Big Mom
was well aware of their movements and had given orders to prevent them from meeting up with Sanji, and ordered the
living trees
in the Seducing Woods to subdue the two Straw Hats. When Chopper ate a
Rumble Ball
and transformed, Brûlée was fascinated with his ability, and promised to collect him for her mother. While Chopper fended off the living trees, Nami ran away to find reinforcements.
In the meantime, Brûlée had also used her ability to transform multiple animals into fake versions of Nami, Chopper, Carrot, Sanji, and
Charlotte Pudding
, keeping Luffy distracted with a chase through the woods.
Alongside the homies, Brûlée successfully managed to capture Chopper inside her Mirro-World. While riding
Kingbaum
, she arrived at the scene where her brother,
Charlotte Cracker
, was confronting Luffy and Nami. She then reverted the animals that she had transformed into people back to normal and threw her mirror (that Chopper and Carrot were trapped behind) to the ground and shattered it into pieces. When Nami and
Pound
were fleeing the scene, Brûlée and the homies pursued them. However, when Nami took out a
Vivre Card
, the homies refused to attack her because they could feel Big Mom's soul from the Vivre Card.
Brûlée is struck by Nami's Thunderbolt Tempo.
While Cracker was fighting Luffy, Brûlée was riding Kingbaum and chasing after Nami. Brûlée revealed that the Straw Hats were not the first pirates from the
Worst Generation
that attempted to take down Big Mom, as
Kid
,
Apoo
,
Bege
, and
Urouge
had tried as well. They all failed but only Urouge was able to defeat
one of the Sweet Commanders
but he was later defeated by Cracker. Brûlée then created and tossed a mirror to the ground and emerged from it, trying to capture Nami inside it.
Pound
saved Nami by trying to throw a punch at Brûlée, who declared Pound as an enemy of the
Charlotte Family
. Nami's Thunderbolt Tempo then struck Brûlée, causing her to fall defeated into the mirror.
Brûlée being defeated by Carrot.
Brûlée later pursued Chopper and Carrot with a scythe inside the Mirro-World.
Brûlée eventually caught them and, after reporting the capture to her brother
Mont-d'Or
,
took them to
her house
, where she made preparations to put Carrot into boiling soup, much to the mink's immense terror.
However, Brûlée had actually captured a frog that she had accidentally made into Carrot's body double, and as she ordered
Randolph
to cut the rope holding Carrot's double over the soup, the real Carrot knocked Randolph over by throwing a rock at him. Not knowing he was attacked, Brûlée shouted at Randolph, but
Diesel
alerted her to the real Carrot hanging on the rope with the fake Carrot. Carrot then kicked the pot of soup at Brûlée, dousing her in boiling soup and defeating her.
Afterwards, Chopper and Carrot took her prisoner as they raced through the Mirro-World to find their friends. They tried to revive Brûlée to get her to guide them to the
Whole Cake Chateau
, but she remained unconscious.
Eventually, Brûlée was revived by Carrot tickling her, and Carrot and Chopper wanted to know where they could reach the castle. Brûlée revealed that she had forgotten and that they could ask the mirrors, and swore revenge on the duo.
Chopper and Carrot went and brought
Pedro
, Nami, and
Jinbe
into the Mirro-World, and Brûlée was shocked to see Jinbe, saying that his presence with the Sanji Retrieval Team meant betrayal. She heard that he avoided the punishment roulette wheel by taking back his request to leave Big Mom's crew, and when Pedro stated that the roulette meant certain death, she laughed and stated that he was right, affirming that no one left Big Mom's crew alive. However, she was interrupted as the Sanji Retrieval Team resumed their journey through the Mirro-World.
Chopper's group later located
Brook
and found him inside Big Mom's bedroom, being held in her hands as she slept. Brûlée tried to alert her mother, but Chopper and his group quickly gagged her. After the group successfully rescued Brook, Brûlée was shocked to see that Brook managed to acquire copies of the three
poneglyphs
.
Later, Jinbe talked to Luffy through a mirror shard, and twice included Brûlée and Diesel in his headcount of their team, and the horrified duo quickly corrected him.
Brûlée and Diesel tied up in the Fire Tank Pirates' base.
Brûlée and Diesel were then taken to the
Fire Tank Pirates
' base, where they were left tied up. Due to Bege's sense of immaculacy, the two were cleaned up and given a set of clean clothes. Brûlée expressed outrage when she found out her sister
Chiffon
was taking part in a plan to assassinate Big Mom, but Chiffon reminded her of how poorly Big Mom had treated her and how she did not consider her mother family anymore.
As Bege went over his plan to kill Big Mom with Jinbe and the Sanji Retrieval Team, Brûlée objected when they planned to use her power to escape. Before the meeting adjourned, Brûlée wondered to herself with a nervous expression on how she could report to Big Mom.
After the meeting, Luffy asked Bege to place a mirror inside the wedding cake. Brûlée expressed utter shock that Luffy planned to destroy the wedding cake, knowing how much Big Mom was looking forward to that. Planning to take advantage of Brûlée's power, Luffy later gathered a large number of animals so she could turn them into fake Luffys.
Brûlée and Diesel later slept alongside the Straw Hats inside
Bege's body
as he set his assassination plan into motion.
The team later went inside the Mirro-World, preparing to charge into the wedding venue. Once they heard the signal, they unleashed the Luffy duplicates into the venue and Brûlée cried in regret at not being able to defy Luffy's team.
After the team and all of the clones entered the venue, Brûlée was left alone with
Caesar Clown
.
The planned mirror escape route is broken.
During the ensuing conflict at the wedding venue, Caesar raced through the Mirro-World while carrying Brûlée, who continued pleading to stop being used to betray her mother.
After they exited the Mirro-World and Caesar set up the escape mirror, Brûlée begged him not to allow her family to know that she was being used. Caesar then reminded her that her Devil Fruit powers were being utilized to cause the chaos at the venue.
When Big Mom began screaming, Caesar flew in with Brûlée and the escape mirror, but Big Mom's scream shattered the mirror, causing them to be trapped in the wedding venue.
Bege then transformed into a fortress to save the alliance members. As Luffy's group and the
Vinsmoke Family
ran into the fortress, Katakuri used
his ability
and grabbed Brûlée from Caesar's back. Katakuri remarked to Brûlée on how her captors used her in their plan, but she replied that she was the victim and told him to make their enemies pay.
When Caesar and Bege nearly escaped over the wall of the venue, Brûlée blocked their way by transforming into a double of Caesar, eager to pay the alliance back for using her. The Big Mom Pirates overwhelmed Luffy, Sanji, and the Vinsmoke Family. However, the
Tamatebako
dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and the bomb inside the chest exploded, causing the castle to topple over.
Brûlée then watched in terror as Big Mom's castle collapsed and her family fell with it.
After
Streusen
saved the Big Mom Pirates by using
his ability
to turn the castle to cake, Brûlée stood with some of her siblings as they organized groups to pursue the Straw Hats, the Fire Tank Pirates, and the Vinsmoke Family. Wanting revenge on the Straw Hats, she gladly joined Katakuri when he told her to follow him in his pursuit of Luffy. However, their plan was halted when Big Mom appeared in a craze. After
Perospero
diverted Big Mom's attention to the Straw Hats, Brûlée listened to Pudding as she explained her plan to satiate Big Mom's craving.
Brûlée later joined with Perospero,
Daifuku
,
Broyé
, and 10,000
Chess Soldiers
inside the Mirro-World. She reported to Mont-d'Or that her soldiers were ready to be deployed anywhere at a moment's notice.
During a confrontation between Luffy and Katakuri on the
Thousand Sunny
, Luffy grabbed Brûlée by the neck while she was standing inside the mirror leading to the Straw Hats' ship. She was then rendered unconscious as Luffy dragged Katakuri into the Mirro-World.
Brûlée helping Mascarpone and Joscarpone attack the Thousand Sunny.
Brûlée later regained consciousness and Katakuri told her to set fire to the Thousand Sunny.
Mascarpone
and
Joscarpone
arrived and showed Brûlée another mirror leading to the Sunny. Brûlée laughed with glee as Mascarpone and Joscarpone shot flame arrows through the mirror. She then prepared to lead an invasion on the Sunny.
Brûlée and her siblings then received word from Perospero that Big Mom sunk the ship. Brûlée was pleased that she did not have to lead an invasion after all. However, Mascarpone and Joscarpone noticed by looking through a mirror to the Sunny that the ship did not appear to be underwater. They were then puzzled when all the mirrors to the Sunny began breaking one by one.
As Luffy continued to struggle against Katakuri, Brûlée started bragging about Katakuri's legendary strength. Luffy tried to punch her, but Katakuri grabbed his fist. When Katakuri pondered on how he should maim Luffy with his trident, Brûlée told him to start with Luffy's neck. Having heard Luffy's conversation with his group and learning about their meeting place, Brûlée informed Perospero.
Brûlée then contacted Pudding and informed her about the Straw Hats' rendezvous point and that
Oven
would be at
Cacao Island
to ambush them. She also encouraged Pudding to complete the wedding cake, saying that she was their last hope.
Brûlée was then found by Luffy, who was retreating from his fight with Katakuri. Luffy grabbed her and used her to escape the Mirro-World. They arrived at
Nuts Island
and found Big Mom rampaging there. As she was held captive by Luffy, Brûlée cried out to
Amande
, who was nearby. While carrying Brûlée, Luffy ran from Big Mom.
With Brûlée still captive, Luffy used her to escape from Big Mom and travel from island to island through the Mirro-World. While hiding inside a building, Brûlée was tied up as Luffy wondered how to defeat Katakuri.
Brûlée being held hostage by Pekoms.
She was later found and captured by
Pekoms
, who intended to honor Pedro's sacrifice by helping Luffy escape. As they approached Luffy, Brûlée was shocked and furious over Katakuri's defeat.
While traveling to the mirror leading to Cacao Island, Pekoms explained his plan to help Luffy escape. Brûlée then explained to him that they have an army waiting for them on the other side. When exiting the Mirro-World, Pekoms used Brûlée as a shield as she cried for her family to save her. After Pekoms transformed into his
Sulong form
, Oven attacked him, causing him to release Brûlée.
Brûlée tends to Katakuri's wounds.
As Luffy and Sanji were making their escape with
Germa 66
's assistance, Brûlée revealed to her family and crew that Luffy defeated Katakuri, shocking them all.
Brûlée later brought her allies anti-Germa bullets, which they used to harm the Vinsmokes.
She then went to attend Katakuri's wounds. When Katakuri regained consciousness, Brûlée told him that the Straw Hats had escaped from Totto Land.

Brûlée helped Oven transport the

containing
Vinsmoke Niji
and
Yonji

Shortly after, she reported to Cracker that
Ichiji
and
Reiju
were in Chocolat Town.
Brûlée and Cracker went to the island to investigate and discovered that the invaders were not Germa 66 but instead were
Kuzan
and
Van Augur
of the
Blackbeard Pirates
. They failed to stop Pudding being abducted by the Titanic Captains, and the town and its people were
frozen
by Kuzan. Brûlée was the only one to remain unfrozen, and she wept over being unable to save Pudding.
