Luffy
was still a kid and living at
Foosha Village
, he went to Chicken and Gyoru's fish shop to buy some fish. While her husband was chatting with Luffy, Chicken was in the back working and smiling at the child.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Like her husband, Chicken is excluded from the anime's
original adaptation of Chapter 1
, which compressed Luffy's backstory into a shorter flashback. As a result, her anime debut comes with her brief cameo in the
Post-War Arc
.
(Some later adaptations of Chapter 1, such as the
Episode of East Blue
special, retain her presence.)
