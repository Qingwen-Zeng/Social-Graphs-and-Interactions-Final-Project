Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Wanting to ride Onepoco, Milo's son chased him, but Milo told him that he was too heavy.
Kyros
—another human-turned-toy—and
Franky
talked with Milo about his past, and then questioned his wife and son, who denied having a husband and father, respectively.
He then continued to walk around town with them.
When Sugar's curse broke, Milo transformed back into a human and had a tearful reunion with his family.
This reunion was soon cut short as Doflamingo trapped everyone on Dressrosa in his
"Bird Cage"
.
Manga and Anime Differences
[
]
Instead of having dark-colored rims and collar in the manga, Milo's shirt was colored white in the anime. Also, there was an extra bit when an elephant and a lion were chasing him and his family, along with members of the
Donquixote Pirates
, one of which he recognized as the one who beat him mercilessly when he was still a toy and then proceeded to punch him in the face as retaliation.
