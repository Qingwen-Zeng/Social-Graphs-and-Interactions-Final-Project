Drip
was a member of the
Fake Straw Hat Crew
who was posing as the real
Sanji
.
Appearance
[
]
Drip disguised as Killer.
Drip is a pale, very slender man with bags under his eyes and a long pointed chin. His hair is parted similarly to Sanji, only much more messy. He wears a suit like the real Sanji, only loose fitting and not double breasted with black dress shoes. His overall hairstyle is loosely based on the poster of Sanji. Ironically, even though Sanji's wanted poster looks nothing like the original, Drip is the one who most resembles (physically) his character, along with
Duval
(pre-face rearrangement).
Later on, Drip would don a poor recreation of
Killer
's outfit, with his hair and face being painted to match Killer's mask.
Personality
[
]
Unlike the real Sanji and
Zoro
, he has a good relationship with the
Fake Zoro
. Out of all the Fake Straw Hats, Drip (along with Fake Zoro) has shown to be among the most perceptive of the Impostors, quickly identifying the real
Chopper
, deducing that
Luffy
(in disguise) might have connections with the
real Straw Hats
(although Luffy's attitude made it clear he knew them, and they did not know he was the real Luffy), and luring him to the
Fake Luffy
without arousing Luffy's suspicion.
Upon the truth coming out, he was discovered to be very cowardly, begging
Caribou
for mercy.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Typical of a fraud, he is very weak as he could not do a thing when he was caught in Caribou's grip and passed out quickly.
However, compared to Manjaro who loses stamina quickly, Drip could still run.
History
[
]
Fish-Man Island Saga
[
]
Return to Sabaody Arc
[
]
Drip was with the fake counterparts of
Zoro
,
Robin
and
Chopper
. When the four of them saw the
real Chopper
, they assumed that he was left behind when the real
Straw Hats
disappeared two years ago. They then planned to capture him and discard the
fake counterpart
to make themselves look more realistic. Shortly after that, the
fake Robin
and fake Chopper were captured by some unknown men, and the fake Zoro and Drip led the real Chopper (who believed they were real at the time) back to
their boss
.
Black told them to forget about Cocoa (fake Robin), which drove Chopper away. Upon reporting that he was the real Chopper, the fake Luffy ordered the fake Zoro and Drip to capture him. The two fakes, unable to find the real Chopper, encountered the
real Luffy
, who was disguised with a cloak and fake mustache at the time. Though suspicious of his connections with the real Straw Hats, they failed to recognize him as the real one, but brought him back to their boss, as Luffy believed them to be the real Sanji and Zoro.
Shortly after returning to the gathering, the Marines, along with
Sentomaru
and two Pacifistas attacked the pirates. Sentomaru easily defeats the fake Luffy and PX-5 reveals to the recruits that their "boss" is Demaro Black, a low-level pirate with a bounty of merely
26,000,000.
Seeing the fury of the new recruits, Drip, along with the remaining fake counterparts, ran out of fear of being killed. When Luffy was forced to reveal himself due to the
Pacifista
's scanning scope, Fake Zoro, Drip, and
fake Sogeking
all foamed at their mouths in terror and shock.
Caribou smothers Drip.
Drip and the other fake Straw Hats (save Demaro Black, Cocoa, and fake Chopper) somehow escaped the battle but were held captive by Caribou and Coribou. As Coribou prepared to bury them alive, the fakes begged unsuccessfully for their lives, making claims that Black forced them to do the impersonations. Caribou, who refused to listen, grabbed Drip and used his Logia Devil Fruit power to envelop Drip in his element to choke him. Fake Sogeking then attacked Caribou with a bazooka but Caribou absorbed the shot, revealing him to be a Logia Devil Fruit user. Drip struggled pointlessly for a while, and then started twitching and shivering. He soon lost consciousness and stopped moving.
Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
Drip survived the encounter with Caribou and was later captured by the Marines. He was then imprisoned in the
G-4
Marine Base
with the other Fake Straw Hats. When the crew rebranded as the "
Kid Pirates
", Drip disguised himself as
Killer
. Inside the prison cell, he listened to
Vegapunk
's broadcast alongside
Demaro Black
,
Manjaro
and
Turco
.
