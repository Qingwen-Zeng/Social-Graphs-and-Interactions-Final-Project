Anime and Manga Differents
[
]
The scar under Pankuta's right eye is only visible in the anime in the first scene of his appearance. Later, when a cellmate beats Pankuta, and when the Minotaur takes them to another cell, the scar disappears. Also, in manga, when a cellmate hits Pankuta, his panama hat comes off and his head bleeds. In the anime this is censored and he just gets hit a couple of times on top of his panama hat.
