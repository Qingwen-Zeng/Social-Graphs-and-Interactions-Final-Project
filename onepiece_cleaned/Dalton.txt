The subject of this article is sometimes called
Doltan
.
Dalton
is the elected
king
of the
Sakura Kingdom
(formerly called the Drum Kingdom).
He is a former
Royal Guard
who once served under
Wapol
.
He is an Ally to
the Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Drum Island Arc.
Appearance
[
]
Dalton is an imposing tall man, with slicked black hair and a goatee. He wears a long, white fur-lined green tunic and has armor plates on his arms; these plates are retained on his fore legs when assuming his full-bison form. Sometimes he covers his head with a green and white fur lined hat, equipped with ear-flaps against
Drum Island
's intense cold, and he always wears long boots. He carries his weapon of choice, an extra-large spade, in a sheath that hangs on his back. In
Chapter 0
, he was seen wearing a more regal armor, and his hair was also parted in three points, instead of one.
After the timeskip, as the king of the country, he started wearing a fur-lined cape with the kingdom's symbol on it over his standard attire.
Personality
[
]
Dalton is a brave warrior and compassionate man who deeply cares for the people of Drum Island and, in return, the people of Drum have learned to trust him. He is willing to sacrifice his life for the kingdom's well-being, as he has proven multiple times by defying Wapol even with fatal injuries on his body.
He is considerably honorable, despising his service to Wapol when he was king and visibly weeping for Dr. Hiriluk upon his death before urging Chopper to live to fulfill Hiriluk's dream to save the kingdom. As the new king of Sakura Kingdom, he lives a simple and humble life, refusing to live in the castle and preferring to live amongst the common people of Drum Island.
Dalton claims that he likes the rice with chestnuts of
Bighorn
. He has the habit of giving people completely trivial information that they never asked for when describing a topic of discussion.
Relationships

Friends
[

Former King of Drum
[
]
Dalton claimed to Wapol that he was indebted towards the latter's father, citing it as the only reason he even tolerated Wapol's reign to begin with.
Dalton already worked for Wapol's predecessor 22 years ago and was close enough to him to act as a confidant, listening to his grievances about Wapol's apparently troublesome behavior as a prince.
Kureha
[
]
Dalton is on good terms with Dr. Kureha; she approves of him as the king of Drum, though she treats him with disrespect. He displays no grudge nor protest against her for her actions; in fact, he seems to respect her for her role in the events of Wapol's ultimate defeat. The two remain on friendly terms; while Wapol disliked her for being a rogue doctor, Dalton is quite content with allowing her to do as she pleases.
Tony Tony Chopper
[
]
Dalton has a sound view of Chopper, whom he views with the highest respect having saved the kingdom of Drum. Dalton saved his life six years ago by stopping an enraged Chopper from fighting a hopeless battle against Wapol and his army to avenge
Hiriluk
's death, having recognized what he was trying to do.
He keeps an eye out for Dr. Kureha's "son" and was the first to tell her when Chopper gained a
bounty
.
Nefertari Vivi
[
]
Dalton respects Princess Vivi, who amazed him when she was a child. It was because of her actions that first made Dalton criticize his own king, Wapol. He compared her against Wapol and noted how even at her young age she was fully aware of her political status and how one minor incident could have escalated into a full blown war between the two kingdoms. Though the present Vivi did not reveal her identity to him on Drum Island during the
Drum Island Arc
, Dalton was even more amazed by her actions with the
Straw Hat Pirates
after realizing who she was following their departure, and how one such as her would ally herself with pirates such as them.
The two would later get reacquainted two years later when they both attended the
Levely
. When Wapol approached Vivi and began insulting her, Dalton stood up for her by intimidating Wapol to back off.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Initially, Dalton was hostile to them because they were pirates but after being moved by Vivi and Luffy's pleas to help Nami he allowed them to pass through the Village. As they traveled, Dalton began to see they were not as bad as he thought when he witnessed their honest concern for their ill friend, Nami. His feelings were shown to have changed to gratitude for the young crew, after Luffy defeated Wapol and liberated the Kingdom from Wapol's tyranny. Ever since then, Dalton has kept an eye out for the Straw Hats, as seen in Post-Enies Lobby Arc, where Dalton was quite happy to see they were still okay.
Enemies
[
]
Wapol
[
]
Dalton was once the humble servant of Wapol, originally obeying the orders of his king through loyalty and indebtedness towards Wapol's father. Dalton however, unlike the other ministers of the kingdom, had a conscience, and after witnessing Hiriluk's bravery and compassion, refused to be Wapol's obedient guard any longer, outright insulting him to his face. After Wapol fled Drum Island, Dalton harbored a deep hatred for his former king and refused to allow him to revert Drum Island back to what it was before his departure.
Two years later, they met again at
Mary Geoise
and Dalton stopped Wapol from insulting
Vivi
. Dalton was dismayed to see Wapol had become king of another country and referred to it as despicable. Wapol yelled at him by calling him a servant, but Dalton firmly stated that they are now equals in a slightly threatening tone while transforming in his bison hybrid form.
Chess and Kuromarimo
[
]
In the past, Dalton, Chess and Kuromarimo were once fellow servants under Wapol and considered equals, known collectively as "The Three Officers" of Drum Kingdom. Unlike Dalton, however, Chess and Kuromarimo never showed any sort of opposition towards Wapol's cruel reign, under the justification that it was necessary to showcase power in order to have Drum Kingdom's population under control.
In the present, both Chess and Kuromarimo consider Dalton a traitor for standing up against Wapol. They also know enough about Dalton's care for Drum's people, exploiting this to their advantage.
Other
[
]
Hiriluk
[
]
Dalton only briefly knew Hiriluk, but the quack doctor still managed to leave a strong impression on him. Hiriluk's selflessness and sacrifice deeply moved Dalton, pushing him to stand against his king's tyranny. Dalton honored Hiriluk's words to protect
Tony Tony Chopper
from the kingdom's soldiers, convincing the reindeer to flee for the sake of Hiriluk's will.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Dalton is a capable and powerful fighter. He was strong enough that Wapol had to consume all of the weapons in his armory just to defeat him. He possesses great strength, which is enhanced by his Devil Fruit power, and he is fast enough to surprise Wapol and decapitate him with a single blow. He is also extremely resilient, as he took many arrows from
Chess
and was covered by an avalanche, and yet survived.
Dalton also has considerable leadership skills, keeping the Drum Kingdom from falling into chaos for years after it was abandoned by Wapol and his men before eventually becoming king himself through election by the kingdom's people.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Bison
Dalton's bison hybrid form.
Dalton ate the Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Bison, a
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that enables him to transform into a bison and into a half-human/half-bison form that resembles a minotaur. His Hybrid form is primarily utilized for combat, and is powerful enough to stop Chopper's Heavy Point.
The main advantage of this fruit, however, does not seem to be the enhanced strength but, strangely enough, the speed: his quadrupedal bovine state allows him to run at a much higher speed than his default human state, making it ideal for transportation. He proved to be incredibly fast, evading the bullets shot at him by Wapol's soldiers with tremendous agility. In his hybrid form Dalton uses
Fiddle Banff
, which allows him to twirl his sword and charge the opponent at an incredible speed, slicing up anything in its path. This attack works especially well against large groups of enemies.
Weapons
[
]
Dalton's spade.
Dalton's main weapon is a spade, a large pole-arm with an over-sized blade. It is not shaped like most spades though (which have fan-like shapes such as the famous Shaolin Spade), and is rather unusual in its shape, being a long double-edged sword-like polearm with a round tip instead of a sharp point. Its overall appearance looks like an oar, but with a metal head instead of wood.
Dalton proved to be quite proficient with his blade, combined with his Devil Fruit powers, which allows him to attack at tremendous speed and slice up anything in his path, defeating a large group of soldiers swiftly.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Twenty-two years ago, Dalton served the
former kind king
of
Drum Island
at a young of 13 and both he and the king worried about prince
Wapol
's behavior.
However, as time went on, the king passed away, leaving the spoiled Wapol to inherit the throne.
Dalton then became a guard to the new King Wapol, but he was opposed to Wapol's cruel treatment of his subjects. Dalton,
Chess
, and
Kuromarimo
accompanied Wapol to
Mary Geoise
during a
Levely
, where they met King
Nefertari Cobra
and his daughter Princess
Nefertari Vivi
.
Dalton is defeated by Wapol.
In order to capture
Hiriluk
, Wapol devised a plan to lure the quack doctor to the castle. Dalton initially objected to the plan, but the King dismissed his opinion.
After the news spread that the
Isshi-20
were sick, Hiriluk rushed to the castle, where Wapol, Dalton, and the rest of the guards were waiting for him.
Dalton was moved by Hiriluk's relief for the Isshi-20's safety and his monologue about men only truly dying once they are forgotten. Seeing Dalton's tears, Hiriluk asked Dalton not to hurt his son the monster, before blowing himself up. When
Tony Tony Chopper
arrived and attacked Wapol, Dalton prevented him from needlessly sacrificing himself and told him to leave the castle. Dalton then turned against Wapol, but was subdued and thrown in prison, constantly mocked by Wapol and others.
After Wapol abandoned his kingdom when
Blackbeard
invaded, Dalton took charge and kept the island from falling into disarray, soon gaining the trust of the people.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Drum Island Arc
[
]
When
Monkey D. Luffy
and his crew came to Drum Island in search of a doctor to cure
Nami
of her illness, they encountered Dalton and some men who thought they were there to attack the island. Dalton and his men were initially hostile to the pirates, but after seeing that they had no ill-intent, Dalton led them to
Bighorn
.
Dalton then took them to his house to warm up. When asked about a doctor, Dalton said that the only one who could heal Nami was a witch named
Kureha
. Luffy and
Sanji
volunteered to take Nami to the doctor. Before they left, Dalton warned them of the
Lapahns
.
Dalton then told
Nefertari Vivi
and
Usopp
about the attack by the
Blackbeard Pirates
and how Wapol had fled like a coward.
Dalton was then told by
Negikuma Maria
about Kureha's visit to
Cocoa Weed
.
Dalton quickly took Usopp and Vivi there only to miss Kureha. After receiving word of Wapol's return, Dalton immediately went back to Bighorn in
his bison form
.
Dalton confronted Wapol and cut him down. However, the
Isshi-20
saved Wapol's life. Dalton was later seriously wounded by
Chess
because he defended the townsfolk from arrows launched by him.
Wapol and his two henchmen then fled when an avalanche was approaching. Dalton was buried beneath the snow.
The villagers wanted to dig him out, but Wapol's soldiers were preventing them from doing that
until
Zoro
came along and defeated the soldiers. The villagers were able to dig Dalton out
and the Isshi-20 treated Dalton's wounds. After Dalton slightly recovered, he planned on going to
Drum Castle
and put an end to Wapol. Usopp attempted to carry Dalton to the Castle
but was too weak. Instead, Zoro stepped in
and the crew were shown a hidden ropeway that would bring them to the top of the mountain.
As they were making their way to the castle, Dalton was preparing to blow the castle up with dynamite. Before they reached the top, Luffy defeated Wapol and knocked him off the island.
Upon arriving to the castle, Dalton saw
Chopper
and recognized him. Kureha treated Dalton's injuries, and he rested in the castle.
After the Straw Hats left, Dalton then watched Hiriluk's cherry blossoms bloom.
Dalton and Kureha were watching the snow fall when some citizens informed them about Luffy's bounty and
Portgas D. Ace
's message for Luffy. Dalton, having recognized Vivi, expected the Straw Hats to be sailing for the
Arabasta Kingdom
anyways, while Kureha mused about the
Will of D.

Dalton and Wapol meet again when they attend the Levely.
As the news of Luffy's exploits at
Totto Land
spread across the world, Dalton read about it on a newspaper.
Dalton and Kureha later arrived at
Mary Geoise
. When Wapol was insulting Vivi, Dalton interrupted and drove him away through intimidation. He got reacquainted with Vivi and engaged in a friendly conversation with
Rebecca
concerning Luffy.
After
Donquixote Mjosgard
stopped
Charlos
from enslaving
Shirahoshi
, Dalton stood beside the
Neptune Family
as Mjosgard promised
Neptune
that he would protect Shirahoshi. Dalton later went to the conference room with the other kings and queens to begin the Levely. As he took his seat, Dalton glared at Wapol.
