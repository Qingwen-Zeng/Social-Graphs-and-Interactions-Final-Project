At some point in the past, Muti somehow lost her daughter
Koala
to the
World Nobles
.
Years later, the
Sun Pirates
, led by
Fisher Tiger
, returned Koala to her home on
Foolshout Island
. Muti wept tears of joy when she saw her daughter again, rushing out of her village to hug her as soon as possible. After Tiger left the village, Muti and the other villagers were approached by the
Marines
, who offered to ignore Koala's escape from
Mary Geoise
on the condition that they sell out Tiger, which Muti agreed to.
When Koala was fourteen years old, she left Muti to join the
Revolutionary Army
.
