Makino
is a bartender from
Monkey D. Luffy
's home town,
Foosha Village
. She is the owner of
Partys Bar
and the mother of an unknown
child
.
Appearance
Makino is a young woman of average height with brown eyes and black hair (dark green in the anime) that goes up to just above her shoulders. When she was first introduced, ten years before the current storyline, she wore a yellow kerchief, an orange blouse with black sleeves and a long light blue skirt and orange sneakers with white soles. Although her clothing changes with her appearances, they are usually similar to the ones she was introduced with. By the time she met Ace, she wore a white blouse with no sleeves, and underneath it a pink-striped shirt.
Twenty two years ago, her appearance was the same as it is now except her bandana around her head was yellow and covered her forehead more.
Personality
Makino is a very kind woman and she was a close friend of
Shanks
, his crew, and Luffy. Makino appears to be a very prominent figure in Foosha Village.
Her fondness for Luffy makes her appear as an adoptive mother or adoptive sister, showing interest in and supporting whatever Luffy's dream is. She seems content with whatever lifestyle Luffy chooses so long as he is happy and amongst friends. She also gave him food under the joke about him running up a "treasure tab".
She seems to have a listener's ear and often appears alongside
Woop Slap
whenever he discusses Luffy's dream while the rest of the village seems too busy celebrating his success as a pirate.
Relationships
Friends
Monkey D. Luffy
Makino is well acquainted with
Luffy
, having known him since he was a child. When Luffy left on his journey, Makino stated how much she would miss him. She has been keeping up to date with his exploits. After Ace's death, Makino was deeply upset when Dadan told her that he was suffering the most. After the timeskip, Makino was pleased to hear that Luffy returned and a short time laterÂ when his bounty had risen.
Shanks
Makino is on good terms with
Shanks
and his crew, having them once as guests at her bar.
Curly Dadan
Makino treats
Dadan
as one of the regular customer at the Partys bar and often paid a visit to her house during Luffy and Ace's childhood times, often delivery imported ale and even food for Dadan's group. She also stopped Dadan from harming Garp further after the Marineford War, saying that Garp also grieved over Ace's death.
Portgas D. Ace
Wanting to thank Shanks properly,
Ace
turned to Makino to learn proper manners. Makino felt amused although he was quite aggravated by her response. She was also saddened over Ace's death.
Monkey D. Garp
Makino is on good terms with
Garp
as well as she often saw Garp disciplined Luffy and Ace at Dadan's house during his vacation. Makino defended Garp from Dadan after the Marineford War, stating that Garp also grieved over Ace's death.
Sabo
Makino apparently had a good relationship with
Sabo
during their younger days, as she became very distressed 12 years after his presumed death, where she read of him allegedly assassinating
King Cobra
.
History
Past
24 years ago, Makino was playing when
Woop Slap
asked her where Garp had gone, and she informed him that he had gone to the mountains.
Makino first appeared in the story 12 years ago, serving Luffy, Shanks, and his crew at
Partys Bar
. She was one of the only two villagers who dared approach the bandit
Higuma
when he took Luffy after she ran to look for the mayor, the other being the mayor himself.
Ace irritated at Makino's amusement.
During Ace and Luffy's childhood under
Curly Dadan
's care, she appeared to have brought some new clothes for them and
Sabo
. In the background, there seemed to be several males looking at her (in a manner similar to
Sanji
when he meets a pretty lady) implying she was very popular in the town and seemed to spoil Luffy as she told Luffy to keep things a secret from Garp.
Later, while bringing some imported ale to the bandit's hideout, Ace asked her the proper way to make an introduction since he wanted to meet Shanks after hearing so much about him from Luffy. After Ace explained his reason to her, she just rested her head in her hand and looked at him endearingly, causing Ace to blush and asked what she was doing. She then laughed and started to answer Ace's question. Makino saw Ace leave on a small boat off the coast of Mt. Colubo.
The villagers watch as Luffy departs.
Makino was also present at Luffy's departure from their village via a small dinghy. She stated how much she would miss him.

quelled the cheering, saying it was shameful.

When

Ace
.
She commented on how Garp was suffering from Ace's death worse than anyone. Dadan responded by saying that Luffy was the one who was suffering the most. This triggered a memory of a time with Ace and Luffy when she was commenting on Ace's rudeness. This caused her to break into tears and run off.

her child
while

read the
newspaper
. When Woop Slap let slip that he was looking for news on
Shanks
, to see if he was doing alright, Makino reassured him that the pirate was probably fine, and reminisced about his time in
Foosha Village
.
She was pulled out of her imagination when Woop Slap commented on an article announcing
