History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
caused violence to break out on the streets of the
Flower Capital
during the execution of
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, the
Mimawarigumi
were sent out to patrol the city.
A week later, the Mimawarigumi accompanied
Orochi
to
Onigashima
to party during the
Fire Festival
. However, Orochi would then be seemingly killed by
Kaidou
as part of Kaidou's
planned takeover of Wano
. The
Emperor
gave Orochi's subordinates the choice between pledging allegiance to him or fighting;
Hotei
immediately pledged the Mimawarigumi's support with no dissenters. A member of the
Beasts Pirates
put his arm around Gangaru's shoulder and expressed his relief that they would not have to fight each other.
Gangaru and his allies are defeated by Hyougoro.
The festivities were then interrupted by the
invasion
of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
; Gangaru joined his comrades and members of the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
in battling them on the side of the Beasts Pirates.
However, he was later forced to fend off both friend and foe after
Queen
infected them with his
Ice Oni
virus
.
The Mimawarigumi and Oniwabanshu later came into conflict with the old
yakuza
boss
Hyougoro
, who had regained his former strength; Hyougoro
defeated
all of them with ease.
