Personality

Kouzaburou appeared to be adventurous in his past, as he departed from
Wano
to adventure despite that being illegal. He was a heroic man, seeing that he helped with protecting a village in the
East Blue
from
bandits
.
In his old age, Kouzaburou was a grumpy, lonely man who spent his time fishing in the coasts near
Shimotsuki Village
. Despite not liking
Zoro
's company at first, he took interest in the boy and gave him real
swords
to help with his training, showing that he was still capable of sympathy. He was also very aware about the nature of named swords, showing particular pride for
Enma
, his masterpiece.
He considers swords that are commonly labeled as cursed to be worthy of praise, stating that these swords fulfill their purpose when wielded by a
swordsman
able to tame the wild nature of the sword. He looks down upon those unable to tame swords and labeling them cursed, calling them weak.

Roronoa Zoro

Kouzaburou met
Zoro
when the latter was just a boy. Zoro pestered him by asking him about his past and he responded by telling him to scram. However, when he saw Zoro's determination to best Kuina, he was kind enough to lend the boy two normal
katana
that he crafted himself, and offered him wisdom about the nature of a
sword
while mentioning his greatest creation. Despite all this, Zoro never bothered to learn Kouzaburou's name and only learned that he was Kuina's grandfather when he died. However, he was able to realize the old man's true identity during his
time
on
Onigashima
when he had trouble wielding the greatest creation that Kouzaburou mentioned,
Enma

Biography
[
]
Back in his youth, Kouzaburou forged the
swords
Wado Ichimonji
and
Enma
, which were classified as
Great Grade Blades
.
55 years ago, at age 26, he illegally set out to sea with
Shimotsuki Furiko
,
Minatomo
, and 22 other people from
Wano Country
.
Somehow, he became a wanted criminal, but was able to evade capture from the
Marines
. He eventually ended up in a
village
in the
East Blue
and helped save it from
bandits
. He fell in love with a woman while training the villagers in
swordsmanship
, and decided to stay in the village. Four years later, he married a village girl and fathered a son named
Koushirou
who would go on to father a daughter named
Kuina
.
He was still living in the village around eleven years before the present day, as
Roronoa Zoro
once overheard him use the cry "
Sunacchi
" while training.
Showing curiosity about the old man due to rumors he had heard from the village, Zoro was at first dismissed by Kouzaburou and resumed his training. That is when Kouzaburou took notice of Zoro's dedication and presented him with a pair of
katana
to help with his training. He also imparted some of his own swordsmanship wisdom to the kid by explaining the wills and dangers a sword may possess, as well as his creation of Enma in the past.
13 years before the present day, Kouzaburou passed away and was buried somewhere in the village.
Legacy
[
]
Even after his death, Kouzaburou's two finest
swords
,
Wado Ichimonji
and
Enma
, the latter he considers his masterpiece, made huge impacts upon the
world
.
The Wado Ichimonji was brought with him all the way from
Wano
and became the prized heirloom of the
Shimotsuki Family
. After his death, it was used by
Kuina
in her final duel with Zoro, who used the two ordinary
katana
that Kouzaburou gave him. Then after Kuina's death, Zoro requested the blade from her father so that he could carry on their dream of becoming the world's greatest
swordsman
. He held the blade and the other two swords during his tenure as a
bounty hunter
and after he became a member of the now infamous
Straw Hat Pirates
, and it was the only sword to survive his first duel with
Dracule Mihawk
whereas the other two were destroyed.
Kouzaburou's other sword, Enma was once owned by the famed
Kouzuki Oden
alongside
Ame no Habakiri
since the age of eighteen. He wielded it while traveling across Wano and throughout his journey as a member of the
Whitebeard Pirates
and then the legendary
Roger Pirates
. With it, he was able to deal a permanent scar on the powerful
emperor
,
Kaidou
. After his demise, it was somehow acquired by Oden's father, the
swordsmith
and former
shogun
of Wano,
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
, until he passed it on to his daughter,
Kouzuki Hiyori
. However, she then gave it to Zoro as a replacement for
Shusui
, and he then used it in the
final battle
against the
Beasts Pirates
, where he inflicted yet another scar on Kaidou and later defeated the All-Star
King
, thus contributing to the liberation of Kouzaburou's homeland from 20 years of tyranny.
