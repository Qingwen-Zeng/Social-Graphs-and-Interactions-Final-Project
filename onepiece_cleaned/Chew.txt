The subject of this article is sometimes called
"Chuu", "Chū" or "Choo"
.
Chew
is a
smelt-whiting
fish-man
and an officer of the
Arlong Pirates
.
He is also a former member of the
Sun Pirates
.
He is one of the major antagonists of the
Arlong Park Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Chew is muscular, blue skinned, and has thick lips.
His Arlong Pirates tattoo is seen on his right shoulder. He wears a necklace, a striped blue vest, dark-brown leather pants, and sandals.
While he was with the Sun Pirates, he wore a dark colored t-shirt with a circle on it.
Personality
[
]
Chew is rather cool-headed relative to his crew members, maintaining a stern, albeit sinister, composure. Despite having less aggressive speech patterns than his counterparts, Chew is still very cruel with his actions, serving primarily the interests of Arlong and killing innocent humans. He does not, however, lose his temper frequently when he does so, only following orders without hesitation or emotion.
Like Arlong and the rest of his crew, he strongly looks down on humans, seeing them as an inferior species to the Fish-Men. His arrogance caused him to underestimate Usopp when he chased him down, leading to his eventual defeat.
He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with
chu
(
チュウ
?
)
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a fish-man, Chew is at least ten times stronger than an average human. He can spit water out of his mouth as if it were a bullet.
He can also suck in a large amount of water and cause a great amount of damage with his
Mizu Taiho
.
He later fights with the apparently-outmatched
Usopp
, but he is ultimately beaten after Usopp wears him down by running away and setting him on fire, before repeatedly hitting him over his head with his
Usopp Hammer
and
Usopp Wagomu
to knock him out. He was also seen wielding a pair of katana when the Sun Pirates stole a Marine battleship after their own ship was sunk.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Chew as a Sun Pirate.
As a youth, Chew was with
Hatchan
,
Arlong
,and
Kuroobi
, when they saw the
Sabaody Ferris Wheel
admiring it.
Years later, after
Fisher Tiger
attacked
Mary Geoise
and formed the
Sun Pirates
, Chew along with the other
Arlong Pirates
memebers integrated with Tiger's crew. During their time roaming the
Grand Line
, the Sun Pirates battled numerous
Marines
.
One day, a former human slave named
Koala
boarded their ship to return to her home in
Foolshout Island
.
After returning her to her home, the Sun Pirates were ambushed by the Marines. They lost their ship and Tiger was badly wounded during the battle. Tiger soon died from his wounds and Arlong was later captured.
Chew was then under the command of
Jinbe
. One day, Jinbe received an invitation to join the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
. Chew suggested taking an opportunity to make an name for themselves, but Jinbe told the crew that he was thinking about accepting the government's offer. After Jinbe accepted the position, Arlong was released.
When the Sun Pirates split up, Chew went with Arlong's crew.
The
Arlong Pirates
then headed for
East Blue
and took over
Cocoyasi Village
,
killing
Bell-mère
in the process.
East Blue Saga
[
]
Arlong Park Arc
[
]
Usopp
,
Zoro
, and
Johnny
arrived at
Conomi Islands
to find
Nami
. The Arlong Pirates briefly had Zoro imprisoned until Nami freed him when they were not looking.
After Usopp angered Arlong, Chew found Usopp and dragged him back to
Arlong Park
.
Nami proved her loyalty by supposedly stabbing Usopp and drowning him in the pool.
As one of Arlong's officers, Chew aided Hatchan and Kuroobi in defeating the contingent of Marines from the
77th Branch
.
When
Luffy
and his crew appeared at Arlong Park to defeat the Arlong Pirates, Chew challenged Usopp, who ran away in terror. When Chew threatened the villagers, however, Usopp declared that he was Chew's opponent, and attacked him with his Kaen Boshi. When Chew turned to fight him, Usopp ran again.
When Sanji and Zoro had finished their own fights, Usopp was lying in what appeared to be a pool of blood, later revealed to be ketchup. Chew began to leave, believing he had won.
Chew defeated by Usopp.
Usopp planned to lie to the crew about his battle, but became ashamed of his own cowardice, and once again challenged Chew. Chew easily deflected Usopp's next Kaen Boshi attack and punched Usopp, pinning him down. Usopp then struck Chew's leg with his hammer and used Usopp Wagomu to distract Chew while he hid in the woods. Chew attacked by blasting the trees with water projectiles. Eventually, Usopp defeated Chew by throwing a bottle of highly-alcoholic sake before using his Namari Boshi to break the bottle and splatter Chew's body with alcohol, then igniting the liquid with his Kaen Boshi.
Chew attempted to flee to the water to put the flames out, but Usopp completely defeated him by whacking him in the head with his hammer and rubber band until he passed out.
He was eventually arrested by the Marines.

Adaptation Differences

Anime Differences
[
]
Chew and his companions encounters Luffy time before the battle at Arlong Park.
In an event that was not directly shown in the manga, Chew was seen capturing Usopp in the anime. While running from the fishmen, Usopp was hiding behind a small tree near a cliff, while below at a beach Chew was questioning a villager from
Cocoyasi Village
regarding Usopp. When Usopp unluckily fell off the cliff and Chew heads there underwater, the villager tries to warn Usopp through signalling, which Usopp mistakenly thought the villager was cheering him on. However, Usopp realizes the truth too later when Chew emerges in front of Usopp from the water.
In the anime,
Luffy
encounters Chew,
Hatchan
, and
Kuroobi
while on a walk, who are examining the remains of
a boat
that recently crashed around Cocoyasi Village.
Live-Action Differences
[
]
In the
live-action series
, Chew used alcohol during his mouth spray attacks instead of water. Due to this, the fuel for
Usopp
's
Kaen Boshi
came from Chew's own supply of alcohol, rather than a bottle thrown at him. He was also shown to be less resistant to the fire, succumbing to it without Usopp needing to hit him with
Usopp Hammer
.
