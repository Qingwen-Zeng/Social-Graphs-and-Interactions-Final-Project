"Calico" Yorki
was the captain of the
Rumbar Pirates
who brought
Laboon
to
Reverse Mountain
fifty years ago from
West Blue
.
Appearance
[
]
Yorki was a blond haired pirate with two tattoos on his face, one under his right eye and one under his lower lip. His tattoos resembled the katakana character,
ヨ
(yo).
He typically wore a white cowboy hat and a green captain's coat with gold epaulettes. He also wore a gold and red pendant.
Personality
[
]
Yorki was shown to be very carefree and light-hearted. He was seen teasing his crew when they fought over a trivial matter.
He was shown to be a selfless captain when he told the crew to leave him, worrying that more of them would catch his disease.
Unlike a typical pirate captain, the only prerequisite Yorki had for being a member of his crew was that you must love music. He stated it was the objective of his crew to make children smile,
and with the exception of his illness, was rarely seen not smiling himself.
Like most characters in One Piece, Yorki has a
distinct laugh

Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Yorki was shown to be very friendly with his crew. He was shown to sometimes tease them, as well as playing along with them.
Brook
[
]
Yorki seemed to be understanding towards Brook's feelings, and they both have a mutual friendship. He understood when Brook felt down about leaving Laboon, and frequently requested for Brook to play
Binks' Sake
, Yorki's—and the crew's—favorite song.
Laboon
[
]
Just like the rest of the crew, Yorki enjoyed the company of Laboon as well. He also got emotional when they were leaving Laboon behind, and would request to sing songs for Laboon to cheer him up.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Yorki was a fairly strong pirate, since he and his crew defeated many other pirates and he gained a bounty for himself after a short time of piracy.
Weapons
[
]
Yorki was seen fighting with a sword, so it can be assumed that he was likely quite skilled in using it.
History
[
]
Fifty-two years ago before the current timeline, as Yorki and
his crew
were sailing the
West Blue
, they came across a baby
Island Whale
that was lost. Seeing that the whale was crying,
Brook
, a member of Yorki's crew, suggested that they cheer the whale up with some music.
Having cheered it up and naming it
Laboon
, the whale began following Yorki and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates through their adventures.
As Yorki and his crew drew nearer to the
Grand Line
however, Yorki and some of the other Rumbar Pirates asked Brook to convince Laboon to stay in the West Blue since he was the closest to the whale. This was because they feared that Laboon was too young to face the dangers of the Grand Line. When Brook's attempt to convince Laboon failed, Yorki ordered his crew to ignore Laboon and not play any music in hopes that Laboon would stop following them.
Grand Line
[
]
Yorki and his crew meet Crocus.
Seemingly having convinced Laboon to stop following them, Yorki and his crew sailed into the Grand Line through
Reverse Mountain
. Upon arriving at the Grand Line, Yorki and his crew met up with
Crocus
and asked if they could stay to repair their ship. To their surprise, they found out that Laboon had followed them into the Grand Line. For the next three months, Yorki and his crew stayed to fix their ship whilst singing with Laboon all the while.
Seeing that the Grand Line was just too dangerous for a young whale, Yorki asked Crocus to take care of Laboon while they ventured through the Grand Line. As Yorki and his crew left Laboon in Crocus's care, they promised to return someday in two to three years and take Laboon back with them.
While in the Grand Line, Yorki and his crew experienced all the hardships that the sea had to offer. Along the way, Yorki and his crew fought against a Marine base. For this attack, Yorki's bounty went up. Despite the challenges they encountered, Yorki and his crew sailed onward.
Disease
[
]
Yorki is surrounded by his crewmates, while on his deathbed.
However, after disembarking at a forest, Yorki and some of the other Rumbar Pirates contracted a disease that the crew's doctor could not treat. In order to save the rest of the crew, Yorki decided to take himself and the other infected members and escape the Grand Line through the
Calm Belt
. With much regret, Yorki told the crew who were still well to give his regards to Laboon. He then asked everyone to leave except for Brook, whom he wanted to play his
favorite song
to send him off.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, prior to Yorki being properly shown in the manga, he was depicted as a typical tattooless pirate wearing a typical tricorne instead of the cowboy hat. His coat was also colored red instead of green. This depiction of him was due to the unclear image of him during Crocus' flashback then in the manga. The image depicted Yorki shaking hands with Crocus, however the captain's appearance was obscured along with the rest of the crew.
The anime, however, changed this after he was fully revealed.
