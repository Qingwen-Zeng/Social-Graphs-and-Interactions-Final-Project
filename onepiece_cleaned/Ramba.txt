History

Past
[
]
Some time prior to the current storyline, Ramba became a known pirate in the New World, and he and his crew became Whitebeard's subordinates.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Marineford Arc
[
]
When
Portgas D. Ace
was to be executed at
Marineford
, Ramba and his crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
to save him. Some time after
Luffy
and allies arrived, Ramba followed Whitebeard's orders in attacking Marineford from the side instead from the front.
He and his crew were later attacked by the
Pacifista
army. After the siege wall was raised and
Admiral
Akainu
melted the
ice
with his
magma powers
, Ramba boarded Whitebeard's hidden ship and entered the plaza with the help of
Little Oars Jr.
After Luffy saved Ace from the second execution attempt with
Haoshoku Haki
, Ramba and the other New World Pirates support Luffy on Whitebeard's orders. Ramba urged Luffy to take the opportunity to reach Ace while Whitebeard keep the marines busy.
After Luffy freed Ace on the scaffold, the Whitebeard Pirates and their New World allies rejoiced. Just when the pirates were about to leave with Ace, Akainu provoked Ace and dealt a fatal blow to him. Ramba was seen by his side together with other pirates, protecting him from incoming Marines. Unfortunately, Ace soon died from his wounds. When the admiral aimed for Luffy's life, Ramba and the other pirates made protecting Luffy their top priority. When
Shanks
arrived and called for a ceasefire, Ramba and the other pirates left the battlefield.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga version of Whitebeard and Ace's funeral in
Chapter 590
, Ramba cannot be seen among those in attendance. However, the anime version of the exact same scene in
Episode 505
explicitly shows Ramba alongside the other attendees.
Although it can be assumed that Ramba was at the funeral, there is no visual evidence of his attendance in the manga to support this assumption and, as such, his attendance can only be considered non-canon.
In the anime, he can be identified through his clothing as being among the news reports of those defeated, alongside the reports of
Elmy
,
Whitey Bay
,
Bizarre
,
A O
, the
Decalvan Brothers
, and
Palms
.
