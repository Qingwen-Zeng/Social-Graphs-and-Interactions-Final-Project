Very Good fights Franky.
When a
Buster Call
attack was accidentally ordered on
Enies Lobby
by
Spandam
, Very Good joined the Marine forces sent to bombard the judiciary island. During the operation, Very Good, along with all of those of the rank Marine captains and above, were sent to attack the
Straw Hat Pirates
on the
Bridge of Hesitation
. Very Good faced off against
Franky
and was shattered by Franky's
Strong Hammer
.
Despite their best efforts, however, Very Good and his fellow Marines were not able to stop the Straw Hats from escaping. Having an important
World Government
island completely destroyed without stopping even one of the invaders, Very Good and his fellow Marines suffered a humiliating defeat.

CP9's Independent Report
[

After some time passed since the incident in Enies Lobby, Very Good led a group of Marines and Government agents onto the homeland of
CP9
in order to capture the failed government unit, CP9. His forces soon found the group
and were quickly defeated by the escaped agents. Very Good himself was beaten up and broken into pieces.
After defeating him, CP9 abandoned him (still split apart) on the island and sailed off on his ship.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, Very Good antagonized Franky much longer, pinning him down with his rapid-bouncing until Zoro batted the segments of Very Good's body into the distance, leaving Franky free to grab his head and blast him into the side of a battleship.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
His name is a pun on the Japanese pronunciation of "very" being the same as "berry" (for his Devil Fruit power).
