Kokoro
is an icefish
mermaid
and the stationmaster for
Shift Station
, a
Sea Train
station near
Water 7
.
She was also
Tom
's secretary during the days of
Tom's Workers
.
Kokoro poses as a human, hiding her mermaid physique because her tail fin forked in two around the age of 30 and allowed her to walk on land.
She has a granddaughter named
Chimney
, who accompanies her everywhere.
She is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Water 7 Arc
and, later on, the
Enies Lobby Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Her facial features make it look as if she is perpetually smiling regardless of her actual emotions. Her overweight body shape, along with her strange smile, makes her look like a frog. She is actually an
icefish
mermaid, meaning that her legs are a fish tail that has been split in two (as it happens to mermaids when they reach age 30). According to the
Straw Hats
at least, she resembles more a
dugong
in terms of appearance and shape due to her obese physique.
When she was younger, she was much more beautiful, like a typical mermaid.
Following the incarceration of Tom and the apparent death of
Cutty Flam
, she fell into depression and developed a binge drinking addiction, letting herself go.
Personality
[
]
Kokoro is a heavy drinker, and she speaks with a mild speech impediment whenever she is intoxicated that gives her dialogue a distinctive ring. In contrast, when Kokoro is sober, her voice is warm and gentle. While she does have a temper she tends to keep it under control and seems to remain happy no matter what events unfold remaining strangely relaxed and calm.
She took a liking to Luffy and eventually refers to him as the
Pirate King
. She is very curious about him because the events at Enies Lobby became very interesting. She came to the conclusion that if Tom were still alive, he would have built him a ship just as he had done for
Gol D. Roger
.
Like many other characters, she has a
unique laugh
which begins with
"Na"
and continues with
"ga"
(Nagagagaga).
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Kokoro is an experienced Sea Train Conductor who is adept at operating such vehicles. In fact, it was through her assistance that the alliance between the Straw Hats, Galley-La Foremen, and the Franky Family were able to reach Enies Lobby after chasing the Puffing Tom using the Rocketman. Her skills were also noted to where she could spot the track even during the worst possible storm and land the Rocketman on it.
As a mermaid, Kokoro could speak with amphibious creatures
and swim at extremely high speeds while dragging the Straw Hats, her granddaughter, and Gonbe with a long cloth.
It is revealed that she is a capable cook or at least knows how to make ramen and curry as those are Tom and Iceburg's favorite dishes respectively.
In spite of her elderly age and obese physique, Kokoro is physically strong.
She has only shown one attack named
Mermaid Kick
(
マーメイドキック
,
Māmeido Kikku
?
)
, with which she kicks an opponent with her fishtail-like leg with enough strength to send a Marine flying far away.

Early life
[

She left Fish-Man Island to support Tom and met her human husband in Water 7. Together, they had a son who was half human and half merfolk.
Tom's Secretary
[
]
Kokoro became the "lovely" secretary of
Tom
and a matronly figure to his two apprentices,
Iceburg
and
Franky
. Before Roger became the Pirate King, Tom's Workers were visited by the Roger Pirates.
When Tom was taken to a trial for building
Gol D. Roger
's ship, Kokoro was watching the whole thing. After Tom was given a ten-year sentence to build the
Sea Train
(lengthened to fourteen years later on), Tom laughed about being given a chance, but Kokoro had been scared by Tom's brush with death and did not appreciate him laughing about it.
At some point during the next fourteen years, Kokoro visited
Enies Lobby
with Tom and memorized some of its layout for future reference.
When the sentence was nearly done, the judge was impressed with Tom's work and intended to pardon him. However, Spandam's CP5 interrupted his verdict by attacking the judiciary ship with the Battle Franky ships, thereby incriminating Tom's Workers.
When Tom was captured by
Spandam
and his agents, Iceburg, Franky, Kokoro, and
Yokozuna
were brought to trial. To save Iceburg and Franky, Tom sacrificed himself by saying he was proud to help Gol D. Roger and wounded Spandam. After Tom was tranquilized, the Judge decided to take only Tom and free his workers. Kokoro hugged Franky and Iceburg as she explained that convicts never come back from Enies Lobby. Furious, Franky stole a rifle from a Marine and used the rifle butt to strike Spandam's face, permanently disfiguring it. After Franky was run over by the Sea Train, Kokoro announced that Franky died and she then became Iceburg's drinking buddy.
After this, she took up a new job as a stationmaster of the Sea Train's
Blue Station
. During Franky's eight year hiatus, Kokoro grew with age, becoming a heavy drinker, bitter about losing Tom and angry towards the
World Government
. Later, her son left Chimney and Gonbe under her care.
Water 7 Saga
[

Water 7 Arc
[
]
Eight years later, when the
Straw Hat Pirates
arrived at the Sea Train station, they met Chimney, Gonbe, and a drunken Kokoro. Kokoro told them about the Sea Trains and how they work, and then offered them the Sea Train route to
Pucci
,
San Faldo
, or
St. Poplar
. Nami told her that they must only follow the
Log Pose
. Kokoro told them that Iceburg should be able to help them repair their ship and wrote a note to this effect, accompanied by a poorly-scrawled map intended as a guide to Water 7.
She later appeared at a bar where Blueno worked when Franky was also there. During a conversation with Franky, Kokoro talked about an organization that was supposed to be secret, CP9. Later that night, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe walked through the town as the Aqua Laguna approached to the island.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
After CP9 took Nico Robin into custody and the Straw Hats resolved to rescue her, Kokoro volunteered to help the pirates. They were joined by Paulie, Peeply Lulu, Tilestone, and the Franky Family. She piloted the sea train, Rocketman, onto the train tracks. As the train headed toward a giant tidal wave, Kokoro witnessed Luffy and Zoro create a giant hole in the wave for the sea train to pass through. When they finally reached Enies Lobby, Luffy went ahead on his own and Kokoro commented on how impatient Luffy was. As the Franky Family and the Galley-La foremen were battling Oimo after defeating Kashii, Kokoro assisted them by crashing the Rocketman into the giant, knocking him out. When the train stopped in the Enies Lobby mainland, Kokoro became an onlooker of the battle.
Kokoro saving the Straw Hats, revealing her mermaid tail.
She later assisted the Straw Hats in entering the Tower of Justice with the Rocketman. After Chimney discovered the secret underground passage, she led Kokoro and the pirates to it after Luffy ran after Lucci and Robin. When Lucci flooded the passageway during his battle with Luffy, Kokoro revealed her mermaid form and carried the group through the tunnel, out into the sea, and on to the government ship that Franky and Robin had taken control of.
Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe watched over an immobile Chopper as the other Straw Hats battled the Marines. When the Marines learned that the pirates were planning to use the ship to escape, they had their warships destroy it. Luckily, Sanji saved Kokoro, Chimney, Gonbe, and Chopper by carrying them off the ship in the nick of time. When the Marines had the group cornered, they heard the Going Merry. They jumped into the sea, boarded the Going Merry, and ultimately escaped Enies Lobby.
After sailing far away from Enies Lobby, the group met up with Iceburg and the Galley-La workers. The Going Merry broke down and Kokoro attended its Viking funeral along with the rest of the group.
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Kokoro and the group then returned to Water 7 and stayed with the Straw Hats in the Galley-La headquarters. When Vice-Admiral
Monkey D. Garp
arrived to see Luffy, Kokoro was shocked to learn that Garp is Luffy's grandfather and that revolutionary
Monkey D. Dragon
is Luffy's father.
Kokoro later swam in the Galley-La pool, as Nami eavesdropped on Luffy and Koby's conversation. She then attended the Straw Hats' big party.
As the Straw Hats' Log Pose pointed to Fish-Man Island, Kokoro explained to the pirates that they would have to cross the Florian Triangle before they could reach Fish-Man Island. When Sanji started to lose his excitement of seeing mermaids after seeing Kokoro as a mermaid, she pointed out to the chef that there are younger mermaids. After Franky, Iceburg, and the Galley-La workers finished constructing the Thousand Sunny, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe then saw the Straw Hats set sail on their new adventure.
