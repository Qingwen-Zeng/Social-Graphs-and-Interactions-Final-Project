Vice Admiral Momonga
is a Marine officer and the Base Commander of the
G-1
Marine Base.
He was one of the five
vice admirals
who had led the
Buster Call
on
Enies Lobby
.
Appearance
[
]
Momonga is a man with a black mohawk and a mustache (dark red in the anime). He wears the standard marine uniform, consisting of a purple and white pinstripe suit with a coat draped over his shoulders, like
Kizaru
. Underneath his coat lies a dark blue shirt and a light blue tie. He is of relatively tall height and very well-built. He carries around his weapon of choice, a katana, either attached to his right hip or on his shoulder.
In his youth, he wore a marine cap and had not yet grown a mustache.
Twenty-seven years ago Momonga looked the same, except his mustache was much longer and thinner, and his mohawk was arranged in a different style, pointing forward.
Personality
[
]
Momonga is very serious. He is stern and dead set on completing all of his missions. As of yet, it is uncertain what type of "Justice" he follows, although he appears to be sincerely concerned on the welfare of his subordinates. However, he is sometimes easily annoyed by their incompetence, as seen when they quickly fell for
Hancock
's charms.
He is apparently instinctive, being that he figured out a way to block the effects of Boa Hancock's
Mero Mero Mellow
beam in mere seconds. Although he is not completely immune to her beauty, he is at least resilient enough to not be completely captivated by her charms.
Momonga also appears to value etiquette and civility, as he was quickly disgusted by the atrocious behavior of many despicable Level 6 inmates in
Impel Down
when a large number of them began hooting and hollering at the sight of Boa Hancock and said disgusting things to
Magellan
, which he found highly undignified and vulgar.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a vice admiral within the marines, Momonga can execute a
Buster Call
if he has the support of four other vice admirals and has authority over a large number of subordinates and those of lower rank.
Momonga has respectable abilities in both mind and body. When he waits to "collect" Hancock, he kills a
Sea King
from the inside. Similarly, he is able to block Hancock's Devil Fruit abilities by stabbing his hand with a knife, using pain to block the lust that consumed the rest of his crew and turned them into stone. Hancock stated that it was his experience that prevented him from being affected by her power.
Momonga also leaves Hancock with a warning that even without his men he is still dangerous.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Momonga has incredible strength as he was able to easily kill a Sea King which is tough enough to resist gunfire and cannonballs without taking any damage. Momonga is also extremely agile, as shortly after he dived inside the Sea King's stomach through the mouth, he swiftly killed it. He has a strong tolerance to pain as he readily stabbed his own hand to resist the effects of Hancock's petrification powers.
Rokushiki
[

Main article:
Rokushiki
Momonga can use at least two of the Rokushiki techniques. During the
Summit War of Marineford
, he is seen using
Soru
and
Geppo
against
Monkey D. Luffy
.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Momonga is a highly proficient and powerful
swordsman
, as seen when he could kill a Sea King with his sword from the inside of its belly. He is seen employing swordsmanship with his Rokushiki techniques. In the anime, he could cleanly slice
Panz Fry
's gigantic soup ladle made of metal and also take down the giant in a single slash.
Weapons
[
]
Momonga carries around a katana with a flower-shaped octofoil
tsuba
and a brown hilt-wrapping, attached to his right hip, which may suggest that he's either left-handed or ambidextrous. He also has a tanto, which he used to inflict pain on himself to prevent himself from getting petrified by Hancock's Mero Mero no Mi.
Haki

History
[
]
Past
[
]
When the
Roger Pirates
and the
Golden Lion Pirates
met up at
Edd War
, Momonga was one of the many vice admirals that were called upon to apprehend them. When fellow admiral
Monkey D. Garp
insisted on going as well despite not given permission to, Momonga commented that it made sense since
Gol D. Roger
was involved.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
After a Buster Call attack has been ordered on
Enies Lobby
, Momonga and fellow vice admirals
Onigumo
,
Doberman
,
Strawberry
, and
Yamakaji
are suddenly summoned by
John Giant
to lead the attack as they were the closest to the location during that time, not knowing that the order was an accident caused by
CP9
Director
Spandam
, who accidentally pressed the golden
Den Den Mushi
, "given" to him by
Aokiji
, while retreating from the
Straw Hat Pirates
and their allies. Thus, Momonga and his fellow Marines set the entire judiciary island on fire with their cannons. Though the Buster Call attack is able to practically destroy almost everything on the island, Momonga and his fellow Marines aren't able to annihilate a single one of the Straw Hats and their allies. Having destroyed an important World Government base and not dealt any significant damage to the invaders that were causing the disturbance there, Momonga and his fellow Marines are faced with a devastating defeat.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Amazon Lily Arc
[
]
Momonga was ordered to retrieve the
Warlord of the Sea
Boa Hancock
and take her to the compulsory Warlord summoning in order to prepare for an attack from
Whitebeard
should he attempt to rescue the captured
Portgas D. Ace
from being executed. Momonga and his men took a battleship to
Amazon Lily
in the
Calm Belt
. Knowing the treaty the
World Government
has with the
Kuja
of the island stating that they were not allowed within three kilometers near the island, Momonga and his men anchored in the middle of the Calm Belt and waited for Hancock. Although their presence was masked by the
Seastone
that lined the bottom of their battleship, they were still attacked by a
Sea King
that their guns and cannons could defeat. Fortunately, Momonga was able to slice the monster up from within and saved his men.
Momonga as the only "survivor" of the Mero Mero Mellow.
Eventually, they were able to meet with the
Kuja Pirates
. Tired of waiting for Hancock, Momonga demanded the Pirate Empress to come out, to which she complied alongside her sisters. Telling her that Ace would be executed at
Marineford
in a week, Momonga gave her an order from the Marines to come with him since she had complied with the summons. Learning that she had simply lied about supporting the World Government during this critical moment, Momonga threatened to have her Warlord status revoked unless she complied. Instead of a compliance, Momonga and his men received her continued refusal and a taste of her powers. Momonga was able to guard himself from her powers by stabbing himself, but his men were not as fortunate and were turned into stone. With only himself left, Momonga told Hancock that he would wait for her to come with him as long as he could. With a determination to not return empty-handed, he told her that after two days, if she did not comply by then, the treaty with the Kuja would be broken.
Impel Down Arc
[
]
Momonga and Hancock arrive at Impel Down.
After waiting diligently and fighting off another Sea King, Momonga's vigilance paid off; Hancock decided to travel with him to Marineford, with the condition that they visit
Impel Down
on the way (her given reason being that she wants to see the one responsible for the war). Momonga complied after Hancock returned his crew back to normal, and having completed his mission, Momonga and his crew headed to Impel Down, not knowing that
Monkey D. Luffy
was tagging along.
Arriving at Impel Down, some members of his crew told him that they saw
pirates
that they remembered seeing before. But because they could not remember the crew's name, he said that it was not important. So, they kept moving forward. Arriving at Impel Down, the Marines stationed there saw him and his crew and let them in as he, Hancock, and a hidden Luffy got off the boat, and walked towards the gate. Momonga told Hancock that because she was still a pirate, she must wear seastone handcuffs and undergo a full body-check before they could go in. She agreed and they entered Impel Down.
Inside, they met Vice Warden
Hannyabal
, who took him and Hancock to a lift to meet the prison warden on the fourth floor. After meeting Ace, Momonga left with Hancock, and was told by
Zott
that
Kaidou
had attempted to attack Whitebeard, only to be intercepted by
Shanks
. They then headed for Marineford.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Momonga slices Luffy with his sword.
Three hours before Ace's execution, Momonga listened to
Sengoku
's speech about Ace's past. Momonga slashed cannon balls fired by the
Whitebeard Pirates
and prepared to fight them. Momonga was still standing alongside
Doberman
and other vice admirals when Whitebeard attacked the Marines after reaching the plaza. When Luffy managed to pass the wall and almost reach Ace, Momonga was among the Marines that stopped and nearly killed him. He hit Luffy with his sword, demonstrating a great ability in semi-aerial sword fights. In the anime,
Doma
fought him when he tried attacking Luffy again. He was visibly-shocked when
Garp
was defeated by Luffy.
When Luffy managed to free his brother, Momonga opposed
Donquixote Doflamingo
, who wanted to let the two of them escape in order to have more fun, while Momonga clearly wanted to stop them.
After Shanks arrived and called for a ceasefire, Momonga stood down along with the other Marines.

Momonga at G-1.
At the

base in Marineford, a Marine officer reported to Momonga that the
"Straw Hat Pirates"
were recruiting new crew members at the
Sabaody Archipelago
. Momonga ordered his subordinates to contact
Headquarters
and assemble forces immediately.

Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Z's Ambition Arc
[
]
Momonga is tasked with transporting
Panz Fry
across the
Maubeugemour Sea
to
Impel Down
. He is first seen asking the giant why he was on board the government's cargo ship, and Panz Fry replies saying that he was just trying to provide for the people who the Marines had stolen food from to supply the
World Nobles
' nightly feasts, and that he had to do that because the
New World
had been in chaos since Whitebeard's death. Momonga counters by saying that the pirates were the ones responsible for the world's imbalance, not the Marines, and the two agree that they have irreconcilable views.
Momonga vs. Zoro
Zoro defends against Momonga. Shortly after this, the Straw Hat Pirates emerge and attempt to free Panz Fry. Momonga attacks Luffy and then gets in intercepted by Zoro, who is able to put up a good fight against him. Suddenly
Shuzo
appears and Momonga comments on how he knows him. Shuzo says he wasn't aware he was on board, and asks him if he is a vice admiral now. Momonga asks Shuzo if he has been the one responsible behind the pirate raids to which Shuzo proudly confesses and announces he intends to cut off Panz Fry's head. Momonga asks why he is doing this if he used to be a former Marine, to which Shuzo replies that he is doing it for the sake of
Z
, which surprises Momonga. Shuzo says he will kill all of them right then and there and tells
Alpacacino
to kill Panz Fry.
Right before Alpacachino's cannonballs reach Panz Fry, Momonga cuts the cannonballs in half, saving Panz Fry. He then tells Shuzo that he will not allow the
Neo Marines
to have their way as long as he is commanding that ship. Sanji chimes in finding him very sensible for a Marine soldier, earning disgust from Shuzo calling the Marines shameful. Momonga angrily tells him to shut up. As the two are about to fight, Luffy approaches them both announcing he doesn't care about their dispute and will stop at nothing to rescue Lily's father, challenging them both.
Shuzo vs Momonga.
When Shuzo and Luffy begin battling, Momonga charges them both announcing he will not let them do as they wish on his ship. Zoro then intercepts him again, pushing him back. The two begin a fierce fight, as Zoro uses 360 Pound Phoenix technique, managing to overwhelm him but pushes the force of the slice away, destroying one of the warships. Shuzo and Momonga then combine their efforts against the Straw Hats together to try and defeat them.
A Thrust Up Stream charges beneath the raft and blows it apart, ending the fight between the three as the Straw Hats escape with the prisoner. Afterwards, Momonga is seen with his remaining crew on a capsized warship. Shuzo returns from his sub to finish their fight as the two battle one last time, destroying the capsized ship. The outcome of the fight is unknown. Still afterwards Shuzo is seen to have returned to his ship, indicating that he had beaten Momonga.
Momonga captures Shuzo and his crew.
Momonga catches up to Shuzo and his remaining soldiers and captures him after they are defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates. Shuzo is surprised he survived their fight and asks how he found him. Momonga tells him he used the same trick he used on the Straw Hats. He put a Vivre Card on Panz Fry to track him, a method of tracking pirates he learned from a teacher a long time ago. He berates Shuzo for dragging the Marines into their personal vendetta against pirates and announces he is being sent to
Impel Down
. Shuzo tells him he'll never talk no matter how much he is tortured and demands he kill him now while they are still in the New World. Momonga tells him that's up to the law to decide, and that is how the Marine's Justice works.
