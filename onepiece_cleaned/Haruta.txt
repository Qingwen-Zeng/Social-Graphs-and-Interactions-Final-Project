Haruta
is the former 12th division
commander
of the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Haruta's concept art from the anime.
Haruta has a crop of short brown hair, blue eyes, and is fairly short. He wears a green and white 16th century-style ruffed outfit with white tights and carries a saber whose hand guard resembles the ruffles of his shirt.
Personality
[
]
Haruta was loyal to
Whitebeard
, and wanted to save
Portgas D. Ace
at
Marineford
. Haruta cried when
Ace
died, showing that he cared for him.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the commander of the 12th division of the
Whitebeard Pirates
, Haruta has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. He is presumably very strong: this statement was bolstered when
Jinbe
remarked that all of the Whitebeard commanders have great strength.
Weapons
[
]
Haruta cuts through the steel equipment of a Marine.
Haruta wields a decorated
saber
with a purple hilt, and appears to prefer a fighting style based on agility and speed, rather than strength, as he was seen jumping around when performing attacks. One demonstration of Haruta's level of swordsmanship is the fact that he is able to cut through steel.
History

]
22 years ago, Haruta was present onboard the
Moby Dick
when
Whitebeard
was talking to
Shiki

Admiral

and later helped in the assault of the Plaza. Haruta was seen crying when
Admiral
Akainu
killed Ace and later appeared along side the rest of the Whitebeard division commanders to fight Akainu. This battle was never shown, but Haruta is shown to be unharmed later on. Upon the arrival of
