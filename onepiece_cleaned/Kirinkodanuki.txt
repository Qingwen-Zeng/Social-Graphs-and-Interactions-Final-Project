tended to the man's wounds.
In
Episode 46
, Kirinkodanuki and the other animals came out to look at
Buggy
after the
pirate
crashed on the island. The animals watched the two fight, and Kirinkodanuki pulled a fruit off a tree and munched on it before giving it to
Kabagorilla
to eat. As Gaimon declared that he had to protect the animals, Kirinkodanuki and all of the other animals munched on more of the same fruit. While Gaimon realized the Buggy was a pirate, the animals all spat out the fruits' seeds. Kirinkodanuki's fruit is accidentally discolored here to match his spots, while the other fruits are purple. The animals partied the same way with Buggy, but Kirinkodanuki and the others were all hungover the next morning when he left. The scene of Buggy's ship getting destroyed was changed to happen next to the island, and Kirinkodanuki and the others watched as
Alvida
saved him from the giant crab.
