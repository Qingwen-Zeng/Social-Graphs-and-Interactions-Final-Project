Itomimizu
is the former
Foxy Pirates
' game official and serves as the announcer and commentator of the
Davy Back Fight
events. He rides on a very large bird named
Chuchun
.
Appearance
[
]
Itomimizu is a scrawny man with very distinct facial features. He has a round, pink nose, no chin and a broad mouth that makes up most of his face.
He wears a purple shirt, yellow gloves, light-yellow trousers, black boots and a striped tuque covering his face down to his nose. It has holes for the eyes so he can see.
He is seen carrying a bag with a
Den Den Mushi
that serves as a microphone.
Personality
[
]
A quick, energetic speaker by nature, Itomimizu is highly enthusiastic about his work. At the same time, he is one of the more equitable
Foxy Pirates
; though he admires and supports the crew's trickery and viciousness, he is also remarkably honest in his commentaries (even exposing several of
his captain's
deceits as they were happening), and will freely praise impressive feats from opposing crews.
He also appears to be somewhat sexist, repeatedly singling
Nami
out for her "heartless" personality.

Adventure of Nebulandia
[
]
When Foxy challenged Luffy to a Davy Back Fight rematch on
Mushroom Island
, Itomimizu once again provided commentary for the event. When the competitors in the Eating Contest lost their motivation after eating mushrooms, Itomimizu reacted in shock. The Foxy Pirates' new crewmates Komei and Dojaku betrayed the crew and took the competitors prisoner, and Dojaku redirected Foxy's Noro Noro beam, immobilizing Itomimizu and everyone on the beach as the two escaped with their prisoners.
Itomimizu stayed behind with the rest of the Foxy Pirates while Foxy and Kansho joined the Straw Hats in their mission to rescue their comrades. He, Chuchun, and Capote came to help Brook and Chopper look for the Rebound Mushroom. However, they were ambushed by the Marines, and Itomimizu and several other pirates sacrificed themselves to help Brook, Chopper, and Chuchun escape.
However, Itomimizu and the others were freed after Brook and Chopper befriended a snake creature named
Kinoconda
and defeated the Marines. They then rode in Kinoconda's mouth to Nebulandia, where they freed Foxy and the Straw Hats. Itomimizu helped distract the Marines by attacking them with Sneeze Mushroom gas, gave Foxy the antidotes for Porche and Hamburg, and the Foxy Pirates helped the Straw Hats beat back the Marines. The two crews later returned to Mushroom Island, where they parted ways. Foxy then spoke to his crew, encouraging them to continue their adventure.
