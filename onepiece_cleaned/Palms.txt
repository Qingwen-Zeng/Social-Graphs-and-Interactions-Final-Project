Palms
is an infamous
New World
pirate
who worked under the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Palms is a slim man with curly black hair and black circles around his eyes, which make him resemble a panda, his overall animal theme. On his head and shoulders he has an indument apparently made of panda fur, with the animal's head on his own as a head-covering. He wears a pair of shoulder pads secured by straps that run diagonally across his bare muscular chest, and dons long, striped gloves, almost reaching to his shoulders. Around his waist he seems to have yet another indument made of fur, but this one is spotted similarly to a leopard's.

Personality
[
]
Not much is known about Palms' personality. However, since like his fellow subordinate captains he refers to
Whitebeard
as "Father", and came to
Marineford
in order to save
Ace
from execution, instead of fleeing through the path he had cleared with his
power
.
Furthermore, he is not one to back down from obstacles, as he was willing to go against all
Marine Headquarters
and even jumping towards the battlefield.
