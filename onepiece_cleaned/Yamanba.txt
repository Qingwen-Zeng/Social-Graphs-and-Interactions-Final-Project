History

Wano Country Saga

Wano Country Arc
[
]
Brook defeats Yamanba and the others.
After
Black Maria
captured
Sanji
, Yamanba and her comrades chased him until he fell, surrounding him.
She watched as Maria battered him and demanded he call out for
Nico Robin
, crying as she did so. Her pity turned to shock, however, when he actually did call for Robin, and she was equally shocked when Robin and
Brook
arrived almost immediately. She watched as Robin attacked Maria and Brook rescued Sanji.
Once Maria and Robin began fighting in earnest, Maria's subordinates were held off by Brook,
including Yamanba. After he made a wall of ice between them and Maria, she heard a scream from the other side, and peeked through a crack to see Maria defeated and Robin standing over her. With the Gifters all lined up to peek through, they were defeated by Brook in a single attack.
