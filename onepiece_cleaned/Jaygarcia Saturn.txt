What is the nature of Saturn's Devil Fruit in One Piece?
Saturn has the power of a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit, allowing him to transform into a gyuki (a bull-spider monster) or human-gyuki hybrid at will. This power appears to be 'awakened', as indicated by the dark, flaming smoke around his shoulders and torso when he transforms. In his hybrid form, Saturn becomes a gigantic spider-legged humanoid with a set of horns. In his full beast form, Saturn is a massive, horned spider-like creature, with his upper back covered by a light-colored flame. As a main form of offense, Saturn can use his sharp-pointed legs to try to impale enemies, from which he can secrete a powerful poison.

What is the relationship between Kuma and Saturn in One Piece?
In the world of One Piece, Kuma and Saturn share a complex and intense relationship. They've been seen engaging each other in battle, with Kuma even injuring Saturn at one point. Saturn, not one to back down, has also threatened Kuma and attempted to impale him multiple times. Their confrontations are not just physical but also strategic, as Saturn once took control of the Pacifista, a weapon associated with Kuma. Despite these conflicts, their relationship also has a past, as they were shown engaging each other on God Valley when Kuma was younger. It's clear their relationship is marked by power struggles and intense battles.

How does Saturn's transformation in One Piece impact the storyline?
Jaygarcia Saturn's transformation in One Piece significantly impacts the storyline. His transformation into a full Zoan form reveals his potent venomous abilities, which he uses to attack Luffy and Sanji. This leads to a series of events including Luffy's rage and Sanji's escape with Dr. Vegapunk. Additionally, Saturn's power to immobilize others and his ability to give people Devil Fruit powers without eating the actual fruit, as revealed to Bonney, adds a new layer of complexity to the plot. Saturn's transformation and his newfound abilities prove to be a game-changer in the One Piece narrative.

Appearance
Saturn was a thickset, elderly man with a full white mustache and beard. He possessed white dreadlocks which he wore a flat black hat over. He had a scar on the left side of his face, stretching diagonally over his eye. Like two of his fellow Elders, his outfit consisted of a black suit over a dark purple tie and a white collared shirt, as well as black pants. He carried a walking cane.
Notably for a World Noble, Saturn had eschewed wearing a resin bubble over his head while away from Mary Geoise.
Saturn's appearance remained consistent since at least 200 years ago.
Personality
Like the other Elders, Saturn cared about the balance in the world maintained by the
Three Great Powers
and wished to maintain it.
This also included preserving the image of the
World Government
by keeping the events of the
Void Century
a secret, and he and the other Elders would immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it.
He knew about the significance of the
Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika
and was willing to go to great lengths to prevent it from being awakened, even viewing angering one of the
Four Emperors
as a preferable outcome to avoid such a future happening and deliberately sacrificing
Guernika
, one of his best agents, to the alarm of another of the Elders.
When global chaos became unavoidable following the downfall of both
Kaidou
and
Big Mom
, Saturn was anxious and sweating as he was left at a loss as to how to respond without the option of covering everything up.
Like the other Elders, he had little tolerance for people of lower rank challenging their authority, as shown during the Elders' meeting with Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
although due to his high position he was highly diplomatic instead of threatening or making hostile moves towards the fleet admiral.
Unlike the other Elders, he appeared to hold a small amount of empathy for important figures that seemed to have merit, as he was telling
Kizaru
it was an unfortunate turn of events that he had to go out and eliminate
Vegapunk
, though this would not stop him from executing his mission, nonetheless.
After locating Vegapunk, Saturn thanked him for all his contributions to the World Government, but not without later declaring that he would die a painful death and trying to consolidate the scientist's regret for having betrayed them.
He also found it wasteful that they must destroy the
Sea Beast Weapons
but preferred to maintain the
Pacifista
as a pragmatic, if reluctant, choice.
Saturn also had his scientific curiosity and lust for power, as he insisted on studying the inactive
Emet
despite direct orders to dispose of it; this would eventually be his undoing 200 years later, as it allowed "
Joy Boy
" to escape, in which Saturn was punished by having his immortality rescinded when Imu found out.
Much like his fellow World Nobles, Saturn had a low opinion of human lives. This extended to those that work for the World Government, such as
Cipher Pol
agents and the
Marines
, comparing them to insects that will merely reproduce regardless of the casualties in the worst-case scenario.
This was shown again while in his
awakened
form where he referred to the various vice admirals concerned for his safety as insects that needed to pipe down.
He also called them fools for attempting to seize Vegapunk instead of focusing their weapons on
Jewelry Bonney
's head. Saturn was not above racism either, as shown with his very first encounter with a young
Bartholomew Kuma
, telling the boy he deemed the entire
Buccaneer
race to be condemnable solely for an unrevealed crime they committed in the past.
Above all else, Saturn was an absolutely diabolical individual with no qualms or concerns about experimenting on those beneath him; he was known to have tortured or experimented on at least eight individuals with most (if not all) of them contracting incurable or rare diseases such as
Sapphire Scales
as a result. Upon learning that Kuma and Vegapunk were discussing a way to cure the former's daughter, who inherited
her mother's
condition after being experimented on,
Saturn decided to use this as a means to turn Kuma into a weapon for the government, forcing the man to agree to have his free will stripped away while also being modified to become a
cyborg
; even after Kuma agreed to these terms, Saturn decided to place his daughter under government surveillance with a threat that if Kuma were to ever contact his daughter or flee, he would make the girl a slave.
Furthermore, after these demands were set in place and Kuma was about to undergo the procedure to lose his free will, Saturn additionally demanded Vegapunk implant a self-destruct switch into Kuma, justifying it as a means to stop him on the slim chance he rebels against the government, showcasing further unrelenting cruelty.
The only individuals Saturn would genuinely respect are his fellow Elders and Imu. When death had finally approached Saturn, he became very afraid, and pleaded futilely for Imu to have mercy.
According to
Sanji
, Saturn (while in his fully beast mode) had completely lost all of his pretense of being human.
Relationships
Imu
While Saturn and his fellow Elders are reputed as the greatest authorities in the World Government, they all secretly answer to
Imu
, the shadow monarch of the world and occupant of the
Empty Throne
who he and his fellow Elders are extremely loyal to revere in high regard. As such, he turned to Imu's guidance regarding whichever "light" deserves to be erased forever from history, indicating their role in the Government's oppressive tyranny for centuries. He also obeys Imu's commands without questioning, agreeing to make the necessary preparations to wipe out
Lulusia Kingdom
on their order. Saturn also wasted no time holding
Nefertari Cobra
at gunpoint when Imu revealed themself to him showing a protectiveness to keep their ruler's identity a secret as well as wasting no time to attempt to kill
Sabo
when he discovered and attempted to attack him, his fellow Elders and Imu.
Despite his loyalty to Imu, it was not enough to save him from their wrath, as Saturn had his immortality taken from him by Imu out of anger for letting Luffy escape Egghead and how he indirectly cause his escape, causing him to die and have Figarland Garling take his place among the Five Elders.
Marines
Sakazuki
After Saturn and the Five Elders at large played a role in the false news of
Donquixote Doflamingo
's resignation from the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
,
Sakazuki
was outraged by how the Five Elders would go out of their way to protect him, not even caring if it would tarnish the Marine's reputation. Saturn told Sakazuki to watch his tone repeatedly having no real concern over his reputation being tarnished and a sentiment shared by his fellow elders as he told him again to shut his mouth again for talking back to them. Saturn appears to look down on Sakazuki as upon spotting
Nico Robin
on
Egghead
he blamed Sakazuki for her survival labeling him as soft.
Borsalino
Saturn appears to trust
Kizaru
at handling the orders he and his fellow Elders give out, having him personally serve as his guard while journeying to Egghead to confront Vegapunk, he also allowed Kizaru to personally handle
Sentomaru
despite him initially telling him to ignore the former Marine and head straight into the Labophase dome. Despite this, he was disappointed in Kizaru's failings at carrying out Vegapunk's execution, noting that he was notably slower at handling this mission but relented that it must have been due to
Monkey D. Luffy
stopping him with his
awakened form
. Unbeknownst to Saturn, Kizaru had assisted Luffy by sending him a pile of food, showcasing a level of disloyalty.
Kuzan
Saturn and fellow Elder Warcury were notably annoyed with
Aokiji
leaving his post to sight-see again while on duty.
He seemed to agree with his fellow Elder that Kuzan leaving the Marines and joining the
Blackbeard Pirates
was a stain on the organization's reputation.
Enemies
Monkey D. Luffy
Saturn and the Five Elders hold tremendous animus towards
Monkey D. Luffy
, not only for his heritage as the
Revolutionary Dragon's
son, but also for all the trouble he and his
crew
have caused. This includes invading
Enies Lobby
and defeating
CP9
to save
Nico Robin
, causing the first mass breakout of
Impel Down
, intruding on the Summit War of Marineford to save
Ace
, and most of all for defeating multiple Warlords of the Sea such as
Crocodile
,
Moria
, and
Doflamingo
.
They collectively acknowledge Luffy's strength and see that he is truly
Garp
's grandson, as well as a deadly variable in their plans. They feared what he would be capable of should he defeat the Emperor,
Kaidou
, and so they ordered
CP0
to eliminate him before that could happen. They were deeply concerned about Luffy's survival and were even fine with losing an agent and angering Kaidou as long as Luffy was killed, as they understood the potential of what he could do once his
Devil Fruit
was awakened, calling it the "most ridiculous power in the world." Their decision backfired, as not only did Luffy awaken his Devil Fruit, but he used his newfound power to defeat Kaidou.
Saturn tries to kill Luffy.
When Luffy later temporarily disrupted their plans by capturing
York
, they were first formally introduced to Luffy, making it their first exchange, during which they tried to persuade him to reveal crucial information, though they were unable to do so. Later, when Saturn arrived at Egghead, he saw Luffy in his Gear 5 form, he immediately recognized him as "
Nika
". Seeing Luffy severely weakened from his battle with Kizaru, Saturn attempted to kill him, only for
Franky
to foil him. Shortly after Saturn was bewildered when he spotted that Luffy acquired food and ordered him to be detained, though he ultimately managed to escape his sight. Once Luffy returned in his Gear 5 form once more spotting Bonney and an injured Vegapunk, Saturn called him and Bonney "stupid insects" that deserved death, Saturn then used his ability to wound Luffy, but it proved useless as the Emperor struck him with multiple powerful blows causing him to be launched through a building. Saturn then returned enraged and in his full beast form as he attempted to kill Luffy again with multiple poison tainted strikes, though was restrained when Luffy entered into his Giant form. Eventually, due to facing multiple attacks from Luffy and a pre-recorded message Vegapunk had activated, Saturn summoned the rest of the Five Elders to deal with Luffy and the broadcast. When the
Giant Warrior Pirates
arrived to help Luffy, Saturn declared they must be erased from history along with Luffy. However, Saturn and the other Elders failed and Luffy and his allies escaped; to which Imu then held Saturn personally accountable for and punished him with death.
Vegapunk
Saturn and the elders first met with Dr.
Vegapunk
after he won the Ibel Peace Prize, inviting him to a personal audience at Mary Geoise. After enlisting him as a military scientist, he tasked him with the development of several new projects, including the
Pacifista
program, the
Seraphim
, and the replication of the
Mother Flame
. During the time of Vegapunk's employment, he consistently monitored him and even forced him to abandon his morality, with Saturn intervening in his work when he attempted to make a deal with the pirate and revolutionary Kuma to save his daughter from the
Sapphire Scales
disease and reprimanded him for talking out of line. Years later, when the elders became aware of Dr. Vegapunk's secret research into the forbidden Void Century, they decided to eliminate him, though Saturn seemed to view killing Vegapunk as a shame due to his many contributions and inventions for the government throughout the years.
Despite this, he was still fully willing to kill Vegapunk, and only prioritized his accumulated knowledge in
Punk Records
, as it would remain after Vegapunk's death.
In return, Vegapunk utterly detests him for his cruelty and total disregard for people's lives. He openly expressed outrage when he learned it was Saturn's experiments that caused the Sapphire Scales to Kuma's loved ones, ruining their lives along with Kuma who sacrificed himself to save Bonney. Saturn was further angered with Vegapunk after the self-destruct command did not work on Kuma and, after demanding that the scientist answer for how he was still capable of free will and receiving the answer "the power of love", decided both men were of no use to him. When he later found out that Vegapunk had secretly programmed the Pacifista command hierarchy to include Bonney as the absolute top, surpassing even that of the Five Elders, he became livid and stabbed the scientist in anger with his leg.
Bartholomew Kuma
Saturn attacks Kuma.
Saturn has a long history with
Bartholomew Kuma
and can be considered the "devil" of Kuma's life. Their history started 38 years ago, when Saturn was overseeing a young Kuma and various other slaves as targets for the
Native Hunting Competition
on
God Valley
. When a government agent alerted Saturn that Kuma was caught after trying to flee, he began to personally intervene and eventually confronted and attacked the boy, Kuma questioned the elder in front of him on why he was born important and why he was deemed a slave at birth, declaring that he would save other slaves like
Nika
and causing Saturn to retort that his treatment was deserved due to him being a part of the
Buccaneers
race, while also telling Kuma his only options in life were slavery or death. After this encounter, Saturn still kept tabs on Kuma learning from an agent that he had become the current king of
Sorbet
and the following two years had discovered he planned on working with Vegapunk to cure his daughter from
Sapphire Scales
(who unknown to him Saturn was the cause of) while agreeing to be the face of the
Pacifista
project.
Saturn quickly sought to use Kuma and his clones as human weapons for the government and went about a plan to force Kuma into becoming part of the
Seven Warlords
while also forcing him to lose his free will under threats of making his daughter a slave with Kuma ultimately agreeing to these terms if it meant he could save his daughter's life. Even though Saturn activated Kuma's self-destruct switch after he was rescued from slavery by the revolutionaries, he learned firsthand that the switch and commands in general didn’t work on Kuma any longer. Miraculously, Kuma managed to arrive on Egghead and prevent Saturn from killing Bonney. Angered, Kuma struck Saturn with a Haki coated punch after years of torment and grief, launching him through several buildings. Furious at this Saturn attempted to kill Kuma but was foiled by Sanji and Franky's efforts, he then opted to have the Pacifista shoot down Kuma and Bonney, but the attempt failed due to a countermeasure implanted in them.
Saturn's hatred against Kuma is shown to have intensified during the
Egghead Incident
, that after dealing with Vegapunk's broadcast, he personally went out of his way to confront him and Bonney to prevent them from escaping Egghead, only to end in futility.
Jewelry Bonney
Saturn was responsible for
Jewelry Bonney
gaining the
Sapphire Scales
disease due to experiments on her mother when she was an infant. Four years ago, Saturn used her as a hostage for Kuma to undergo modifications into a human weapon without his memories and will. Initially years after this, despite Bonney gaining infamy as a
Super Rookie
and member of the
Worst Generation
while escaping capture from the Marines prior, Saturn still viewed her as a merely a child that outgrew her use and did not need to be dealt, but changed his opinion when Bonney discovered his history with Vegapunk and Kuma leading her to stab Saturn. Saturn healed the wound but grabbed and began crushing Bonney telling her that Kuma's persecution was due to him being a
Buccaneer
and that she would die a painful death for defying the government while ordering the Marines to shoot her.
When Bonney attempted to fight back, Saturn cruelly mocked her by revealing he was the one who gave Bonney her
Devil Fruit ability
as part of his experiment. He went on to admit he was the one responsible for Ginny, Bonney's mother, having Sapphire Scales due to his experiments, which pass down to Bonney and resulted in Kuma sacrificing himself to save her, these revelations filled Bonney with despair. Before Saturn could strike her with a killing blow Kuma intervened, blocking the blow and attacked the elder saving Bonney. Saturn then opted to have the Pacifista shoot down Kuma and Bonney, but the attempt failed due to a countermeasure implanted in them, after he ordered Kizaru to kill her but was prevented from doing so by Luffy. He did his last attempt to kill Bonney but was foiled by
Emet
as well Bonney successfully escaped from Saturn and the other Elders.
Sabo
Although initially unknown to Saturn,
Sabo
gained the Five Elders' attention and Imu when he stepped in to protect
Nefertari Cobra
from their assassination attempt in the Throne Room at Mary Geoise and were exasperated when he managed to escape their grasp, having witnessed Imu sitting on the Empty Throne, effectively making him their number one enemy. They noticed Sabo's affiliation with several occupants of the mysterious
D.
, noting he was fate-struck by having encountered several of them.
Other
Shanks
Though
Shanks
is considered an enemy given his status as a pirate, Saturn and his fellow Five Elders showed respect towards him and even allowed him an audience with them inside
Mary Geoise
, making room in their political agendas for him.
Abilities and Powers
As one of the
Five Elders
, the highest-ranking
World Nobles
, Saturn was one of the World Government's five highest authorities who, as a group, wield unrivaled influence over the world;
with only
Imu
(in secret) outranking them.
Saturn thus controlled every facet of the government, from the
Marines
to the
Cipher Pol
agencies, and even the
Fleet Admiral
cannot challenge his power.
Specific examples of Saturn's authority (as shared by his fellow Elders) were his ability to order entire islands destroyed via a
Buster Call
or by deploying (on Imu's behalf) the
Mother Flame
, whose preparations to carry out are prepared by Saturn given his wisdom in the field of science.
The Elders also have the ability to manipulate the global mediascape to alter or withhold facts from the general public (up to and including erasing entire segments of history, most notably the Void Century).
In addition, Saturn and the other Elders are endowed with total authority over the
Pacifista
and
Seraphim
(above even their creator, Dr.
Vegapunk
's,
though due to Vegapunk's secret meddling, their authority over all Kuma-formed Pacifista is second to
Jewelry Bonney
).
Due to Saturn's Elder status, Marines at or below the
commodore
rank are not permitted to look upon him, with transgressors being punished with death by Saturn himself.
As a fighter, Saturn had proven himself very powerful, like his fellow Elders. As a potential hint to their power, the five of them were confident in being able to meet face-to-face with
Shanks
, an
Emperor
of the Sea, in
Pangaea Castle
without having anyone there to guard them.
On
Egghead
, Saturn was willing to personally move into the island center and come face to face with another Emperor's
pirate crew
,
as well stay on Egghead despite an impending bombardment more intense than a Buster Call.
Even more, Saturn was quick and unhesitating in engaging Luffy in battle, and while seemingly not hurting the latter significantly, the Elder's apparent immortality allowed him to shrug off any attack that Luffy tried on him, including one that seemed to incapacitate a
Marine Admiral
.
He also possessed tremendous willpower, remaining conscious from
Joy Boy
's Supreme King Haki released by
Emet
, which was powerful enough to knock out every Vice Admiral in a huge range.
Physical Abilities
Saturn had exhibited extremely high level of endurance enhanced by his immortality and regeneration, remaining unfazed by Jewelry Bonney stabbing him near his neck with a sword
and shrugging off an incredibly strong punch to the face from
Bartholomew Kuma
, which sent the Elder crashing through two buildings.
Even after being shot through the sides of his abdomen by
Franky
's
Radical Beam
, Saturn survived and remain unbothered.
Saturn was also strong enough to destroy machinery using his cane.
Scientific Expertise
As the Warrior God of Science and Defense,
Saturn held the authority to govern any scientific endeavors of the World Government along with immense resources to perform experiements using Devil Fruits and unethical human experimentation. He is also a
scientist
himself and was confident enough in his own intelligence to believe that Vegapunk, the world's smartest man, would be unable to deceive him when it came to Kuma's cyborg modifications.
However, Saturn overestimated himself in that regard, as he failed to realize the self-destruct switch that he ordered Vegapunk to install into Kuma was instead designed to simply shut him down, instead of exploding his body.
Similarly, Saturn was unable to foresee Vegapunk altering the chain of command over the
Pacifista
by making
Jewelry Bonney
the highest authority possible over the weapons.
Among Saturn's scientific accomplishments, he was once able to successfully extract the essence of the
Toshi Toshi no Mi
and subsequently inject it into the body of an infant Bonney to grant her powers at an age where normal ingestion would be impossible. That being said, Saturn's scientific capabilities in this respect are also limited, at least compared to Vegapunk's, as he was incapable of dealing with the
Sapphire Scales
that plagued
Ginny
despite conducting multiple experiments on her.
Unique Powers
Notably, Saturn was shown to have some abilities and traits that are esoteric in nature. Which of these, if any, stem from his
Devil Fruit
is currently unclear:
Saturn emerges from a Magic Circle.
Saturn regenerates a lost arm and horn.
Saturn harming an individual with invisible force.
Saturn seemed either unaging or to age slower than normal. During Emet's attack on
Mary Geoise
two centuries ago, he bore the same aged look as he does in the present.
Additionally, Jewelry Bonney's
age-changing powers
appear to have no effect on him.
This longevity appears to be connected to Imu who was able to rescind it as punishment on Saturn, visibly aging him up to the point where he became reduced to a skeleton.
At least in his
Zoan
forms, Saturn can heal from injuries. When he was pierced by a sword, the wound healed within seconds of the blade's removal, with even the blood stain vanishing.
Likewise, after his left horn was broken off and his right arm severed, Saturn regenerated both, alongside the sleeve of his suit.
Even after a potentially fatal hit by Franky's
Radical Beam
that pierced through his abdomen from side to side, he remained unfazed as the injury healed over.
Due to the myriad of attacks that Saturn has managed to survive and heal from so far, Luffy is convinced that Saturn (and his fellow Elders) must have some form of immortality.
While in his Zoan form, Saturn arrived on Egghead by emerging from a "
Magic Circle
"
(
魔法陣
,
Mahōjin
?
)
on the ground as if through a portal; said circle had a pentagram in its middle and five number 5s in-between its jags, possibly a reference to the Five Elders. As Saturn appeared, the circle emitted black,
Haki
-esque lightning while having fiery energy erupt from it, and several powerful fighters on Egghead took notice of the "strange" presence that had arrived.
Saturn appears to be able to create multiple circles as well to summon others, having created four of them to teleport his fellow Elders from Mary Geoise all the way to Egghead.
It appears that there is a range limit to this, as
Marcus Mars
was returned to his original location after being sent flying far away from the place he had been summoned to. A strong enough burst of
Haki
also seemingly forced those who traveled through the circle back to their original location.
In his Beast Form, Saturn appeared to have some form of telepathy, at least with his other Elders. He was able to communicate with them from as far away as Egghead, while they were at Mary Geoise.
Even in human form, he can be connected to this form of communication with at least Imu.
In both his human
and Zoan forms, Saturn can project some kind of invisible, aura-like "force" resembling telekinesis, without having to move. When invoking this power, visibly indicated by his eyes glowing, Saturn can injure people with a mere look,
knock them back as though with an unseen blow,
and physically force them to the ground to keep immobile. Vegapunk, who is aware of the contents of the Devil Fruit Encyclopedia, surmised that this may be the result of a Devil Fruit. The abilities are shown to be effective even against a
Worst Generation
pirate like Jewelry Bonney, a
modified human
like
Sanji
, and an android like
Atlas
.
Interestingly, Luffy was able to shrug off the attack while in his Gear 5 form.
Devil Fruit
Saturn's Awakened Human-Beast Form.
Saturn's Awakened Beast Form.
Saturn burns through a tree using venom.
Saturn spits venomous orbs.
Saturn had acquired the power of a
Mythical Zoan
-type
Gyuki
(
牛鬼
,
Gyūki
?
)
Devil Fruit, which let him transform into a gyuki—a monstrous bull-spider—and a human-gyuki hybrid at will.
Saturn appears to have "
awakened
" this ability while maintaining his personality, as indicated by the ribbon of dark, flaming smoke around his shoulders and torso when he is transformed.
In his hybrid form, Saturn was gigantic—large enough to hold Jewelry Bonney in one hand and tower over the very large Bartholomew Kuma. He had proven durable enough to withstand a point-blank
Hiken
from
Sabo
without being scathed
and strong enough to injure an adult-form Bonney in his grip.
As a main form of offense, the elder also used his sharp-pointed legs to try to impale enemies, managing to pierce even Kuma's
stronger-than-steel
body.
In his full "Beast" form, Saturn was a massive, horned spider-like creature, with his upper back covered by a light-colored flame. He retained his beard, which appears to have grown, and his face was still recognizable from his human and hybrid forms, but his eyes were considered "bizarre" by
Sanji
's account. In said form, Saturn can excrete a powerful corrosive poison from his sharp legs, which appear to be able to move with great freedom as if they were tentacles, and they move with enough force to shatter the ground. His arms also appear to have transformed into an additional pair of legs, giving him eight in total.
By spinning his entire body horizontally, he can achieve a form of flight, similar to a helicopter propeller, as he did so to return to the battlefield when Luffy attempted to throw him afar.
He also has the ability to spit out venomous orbs that can produce enormous explosions.
Haki
Main article:
Haki
Like the other Elders, Saturn possessed powerful Haki. His arrival on Egghead was accompanied by a massive burst of it, appearing as black lightning.
His Haki alongside the other Elders' was sensed by
Roronoa Zoro
and
Rob Lucci
from a fair distance away, and being described as massive.
Supreme King Haki
Saturn was one of the very few people in the world who had the ability to use
Supreme King Haki
. He used it to knock several
Den Den Mushi
unconscious.
Observation Haki
Saturn was a very skilled user of
Observation Haki
, as shown when he used it to detect the Den Den Mushi inside the Labophase.
Weapons
Saturn possesses a
flintlock pistol
, which he took out when the Five Elders prepared to assassinate
Nefertari Cobra
.
Saturn can utilize his cane in order to destroy small objects. It is unknown if this is something that has real combat application. The size of his cane can grow alongside him as shown when he transformed into his human-beast form to use it.
History
Past
Saturn commissions a team of scientists to study the Iron Giant.
About 200 years ago, Saturn surveyed the aftermath of
Emet
's attack on
Mary Geoise
with some scientists. Despite the scientists being given orders to dispose of the Iron Giant, Saturn secretly ordered them to research it in the aims of using it one day for the military, assuring the scientists that he would protect them should it ever be discovered.
38 years ago, Saturn was in attendance during the
Native Hunting Competition
at
God Valley
where he was alerted by an agent that a
Buccaneer
slave
that tried to escape was caught.
Saturn went on to confront the young Kuma himself, incapacitating him using his ability. Saturn informed Kuma that Buccaneers were born to be slaves but grew irate when Kuma proudly stated that he planned to save as many people as he could, just like Nika. Saturn was presumably unable to stop Kuma, as Kuma would later escape the island after rescuing 500 people.
As recognition for his genius inventions in
MADS
,
Dr. Vegapunk
was invited to
Mary Geoise
for an audience with the
Five Elders
.
Twenty years before the start of the series, the Five Elders spoke via
Den Den Mushi
to Professor
Clover
, an
archaeologist
from
Ohara
who was revealed to have been studying the
Poneglyphs
. Clover revealed that he knew too much about the
Void Century
, causing the Five Elders to order the
Cipher Pol
unit on Ohara to eliminate him and for a
Buster Call
to destroy Ohara and its historians.
Less than fourteen years ago,
Spandam
persuaded the Five Elders to give him the authority to seek out the blueprints for
Pluton
.
Twelve years ago, Saturn conducted experiments on the former Revolutionary commander
Ginny
who was
forcibly
made into the eighth wife of a World Noble 2 years prior, causing her to develop
Sapphire Scales
. During these experiments, he tested whether a
Devil Fruit
could be extracted and given to an infant using Ginny's newborn
Jewelry Bonney
as a test subject, causing Bonney to gain the ability of the
Toshi Toshi no Mi
, but also contracted Sapphire Scales.
Six years ago, Saturn was perplexed when informed that a new king had taken the throne of
Sorbet
. Four years ago, Saturn would listen in to Bartholomew Kuma and Vegapunk's conversation on the creation of Pacifista and curing Jewelry Bonney, using a
Black Den Den Mushi
. Saturn was disappointed in Vegapunk for not making the most of the situation but would inform his subordinates that he had his own plans.
Saturn speaks with Kuma about his conditions to authorize Bonney's surgery.
Saturn began to enact this by sending
Kizaru
and a Marine fleet with
X Drake
on board to surround Vegapunk's island, while having him bring a Den Den Mushi to communicate with Vegapunk and Kuma. Saturn told them while he was not pleased with their agreement of making clone models of Kuma for the
Pacifista
project and to cure his daughter, he would relent under three specific conditions: the first being that Kuma would enlist as a member of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
. When Saturn announced the second condition, that Kuma would need to be modified into a human weapon under the government's control, this outraged Vegapunk especially with Kizaru defending in favor of it. Finally, the third condition would be that Kuma would have his mind and will effectively be erased; this especially angered Vegapunk as he believed the process would effectively kill Kuma, but Kuma himself agreed to the terms and was grateful that Bonney would finally be cured.
Saturn learned from Vegapunk that the surgery would take about six months and a full year for Bonney to walk into sunlight again, and 2 full years for Kuma's modifications to be completed. With this in mind, Saturn decided to alter the deal by making Bonney a hostage and placing her under government surveillance. He also threatened that if Kuma ever tried to contact her before his mind was fully gone or flee, then he would make Bonney a slave with Kuma accepting all the conditions only with the promise that Bonney be safely returned to
Sorbet Kingdom
, which Saturn allowed.

Summit War Saga
Sometime before the
Summit War of Marineford
, Saturn called Vegapunk with an order to implant a self-destruct switch onto Kuma; when Vegapunk argued that it was unnecessary as Saturn and the other Elders already were at the top of the authority hierarchy in terms of control, Saturn coldly said the scientist had no right to talk back to him in that manner. He also refused Vegapunk's counteroffer to allow Kuma bare minimum willpower if he were to add that switch; Saturn ordered Vegapunk once more to remove all of Kuma's will and reminded him, as a fellow scientist, he would be able to see any deception if he did not carry it out.
Post-War Arc
The Five Elders talked about the aftermath of the
Summit War of Marineford
, with Saturn noting all the things that Luffy had done and saying it was appropriate that he was
Garp
's grandson. They then talked about
Blackbeard
's rise to power, and Saturn noted that he had already taken down one of the
Super Rookies
.

Dressrosa Arc
Saturn and the other Elders arguing with Sakazuki.
Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
came to the Room of Authority to question the Five Elders about why they let
Donquixote Doflamingo
use the
World Nobles
' authority to misinform the entire world. The elders reminded Sakazuki of his place and reprimanded his insolence, when a Marine came in and revealed that Luffy and
Trafalgar Law
's alliance had taken down Doflamingo, and that their victory had been broadcast to the entire world, shocking both the Elders and Sakazuki.
Whole Cake Island Saga
Levely Arc
Saturn and the other Elders meet with Imu.
As the
Levely
was beginning, the Five Elders were approached by Shanks. Because of his position, they reluctantly allowed him to talk to them about a certain pirate.
After meeting with Shanks, they headed toward the
Empty Throne
and talked about how King
Nefertari Cobra
of
Arabasta
had requested to meet with them. Saturn then noted that with all the events going on threatening the balance, the Elders were no longer able to prevent them. Upon reaching the Empty Throne, they knelt before its occupant
Imu
as they requested that Imu tell them the name of the "light" that needed to be extinguished from history.
Wano Country Saga
Wano Country Arc
The Five Elders are ambushed by Sabo.
On the fourth day of the Levely, Saturn was part of the other Elders when they had their private audience with Cobra, who had requested the audience earlier. Saturn was listening to Cobra's recounting of the World Government's founding and his explanation about his ancestor,
Nefertari Lili
. When Cobra asked the Elders why her name was not mentioned anywhere anymore, Saturn replied they could not answer the question as it was too far into the history to be known anymore. When Cobra grew displeased over their secrecy, he instead asked about the
Will of D.
, mentioning a letter Lili wrote 800 years ago. However, before either Saturn or the other Elders could answer the question, Imu, who overheard the conversation from their private room, made their way towards the Empty Throne, leaving everybody present in shock over their arrival.
After Imu answered the questions Cobra had, Saturn, alongside the rest of the Elders, drew a gun, ready to assassinate Cobra due to him having seen Imu. However, before they could kill him,
Sabo
, who eavesdropped the entire conversation, came in to rescue Cobra, using
Hiken
to engulf the Elders in fire. However, Saturn, alongside the other Elders, transformed into shadowy monsters, ready to launch at Sabo and preventing him from escape. However, they failed as Cobra sacrificed himself to ensure Sabo could escape safely. The Elders', after having successfully killed Cobra, noticed
someone
spying on them, but were unable to capture the person.
When
Bartholomew Kuma
was liberated from Mary Geoise in the
Revolutionary Army
's raid during the Levely, Saturn activated the self-destruct switch that he had ordered Vegapunk to install in Kuma. Unbeknownst to him, Vegapunk had not fully followed his orders and had instead programmed the switch to put Kuma in a vegetative state.
Following the Levely's conclusion, the Five Elders were in the Room of Authority discussing
Sabo
and the growing issues with
Vegapunk
on
Egghead
when they received a call from Imu, who wished to test out Vegapunk's
Mother Flame
invention on the
Lulusia Kingdom
. Saturn assured Imu they would prepare everything for the Mother Flame to be deployed. Imu also gave them the command to find and seize
Nefertari Vivi
.
Saturn talks about potential courses of action following the defeats of Kaidou and Big Mom.
They later discussed the
Raid on Onigashima
, namely the orders they had given to eliminate
Nico Robin
and prepare to have the Marines assume control of
Wano Country
in the aftermath of the battle.
They then discussed the potential of the
Gomu Gomu no Mi
, or the "Hito Hito no Mi, Model:
Nika
" awakening, and commanded
Guernika
to interfere in the battle between
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Kaidou
to eliminate the former, who possessed the fruit's power. Guernika sacrificed himself to allow Kaidou to inflict a deadly blow on Luffy, and when one of the Elders asked if eliminating Luffy was worth losing an agent and angering Kaidou, Saturn responded that it was preferable compared to the potential outcome of Luffy's fruit awakening.
The Five Elders' attempt to eliminate Luffy proved a failure, as they later came to learn that the Gomu Gomu no Mi had indeed been awakened and Kaidou and Big Mom had both fallen in battle. Saturn wondered how they could respond to this as there would be no way to cover this up.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
One Piece Film: Red
The Five Elders watched
Uta
's concert in
Elegia
from the
Den Den Mushi
. They discussed about Uta being the daughter of Shanks, a serious threat that was opposed to the Great Pirate Era, and how to stop her rebellion, though there was some hesitation among them to carry out her elimination as they worried, she may have been related to the
Figarland Family
. Also, they were very concerned about Uta's connection with
Tot Musica
and they could not afford to be cautious if she summoned that as a threat. The Five Elders were the only ones who did not fall asleep to Uta's powers as they already muted her songs. They were later informed by
Rob Lucci
about an estimate being 70% of the world's population would be pulled into
Uta World
.
The Five Elders, horrified, witnessed Uta turning everyone including
Saint Charlos
into inanimate objects. As they could not afford more casualties, they had to make a decision even if a Celestial Dragon would get caught in the crossfire. They witnessed Tot Musica, finally summoned by Uta, attacking the Marine ships. After Tot Musica was defeated by Luffy and Shanks, the Five Elders witnessed Uta releasing everyone from the Uta World through singing.
Concludes non-canon section.
Final Saga
Egghead Arc
The Five Elders received a call from
Vegapunk York
, who was aspiring to become a Celestial Dragon, that Vegapunk was doing forbidden research on the Void Century. As a result, they decided to send a squad of CP0 agents to assassinate Vegapunk and all his satellites, including York.
Around eight days after York made contact, the Elders were preparing for the destruction of Lulusia when they received a call from
Marine Headquarters
revealing they had traced Sabo to Lulusia; the Elders took note of this stroke of fortune as the Lulusia Kingdom was completely annihilated by a Mother Flame-powered
Ancient Weapon
soon afterwards.
Five days after Lulusia's destruction, Saturn decided to personally accompany the fleet led by Marine Admiral
Kizaru
to
Egghead
to back up CP0 in their mission. Saturn told Kizaru that he considered the circumstances with Vegapunk to be a shame.
The next day, the fleet surrounded Egghead with Saturn staying hidden inside his quarters. He learned from
Vice Admiral
Doberman
that most of the involved parties in the Egghead conflict, which now included the
Straw Hat Pirates
and
Jewelry Bonney
, were in the impenetrable
Labophase
above the island and their statuses were unknown. Saturn also learned that Egghead's research staff and technicians had evacuated the previous day, and he ordered for their ships to be hunted down and sunk. The Five Elders then received a call from York, who confronted them for trying to eliminate her as well. Peter responded that they had changed their minds in order to obtain more of the Mother Flame, and York then revealed that the Straw Hats and other Vegapunks had defeated her and taken her hostage.
The call then ended after Luffy briefly joined it, and Saturn told the others they must retain three things: York alive, Vegapunk's
Punk Records
brain, and the power plant creating the Mother Flame; in the worst case scenario, he was content to lose the CP0 agents. However,
Rob Lucci
was able to transmit much information about Egghead and the parties on it; Saturn instructed Kizaru to use
his powers
to bypass the Labophase's laser defenses and initiate the attack, though Kizaru insisted on battling his former comrade
Sentomaru
first and warned that Vegapunk's forces would immediately start fighting back.
After Kizaru defeated Sentomaru and took control of the
Pacifistas
, Saturn told the Marines to provide him with damage reports.
Saturn confronts Vegapunk and his allies.
Vegapunk then descended from the Labophase to override Kizaru and regain control of the Pacifistas, but soon afterward Saturn overrode Vegapunk and ordered the Pacifistas to stand down as he teleported onto Egghead's surface via Magic Circle in his human-gyuki hybrid form. Upon fully manifesting, a Marine below Commodore rank had his head blown off just by Saturn looking at him. Saturn saw Luffy in Gear 5 falling from the sky following his battle with Kizaru, and recognized him as
Nika
. Vegapunk,
Atlas
, Bonney,
Sanji
, and
Franky
then landed right in front of Saturn, who turned his attention toward Vegapunk. However, Bonney wasted no time as she took a sword and plunged it into Saturn's chest to avenge her father Kuma.
Saturn quickly assuaged the Marines that he would have avoided the blade if it could do real damage; he then grabbed Bonney, dealt head injuries to her and Sanji by just looking at them, and pulled out the sword as the wound it left healed immediately. With Luffy and Kizaru both down following their fight, Saturn moved to stab Luffy, but Franky hit Luffy out of the way of Saturn's claw.
Saturn is punched by Kuma.
Saturn then turned his attention toward Bonney, saying Kuma was dead. Bonney used her
Distortion Future
technique to give herself a Nika-like future and inflate her arm, but reverted back to normal after a glancing blow. Revealing he was the one who gave Bonney
her power
, Saturn told her that the more she knew about the future, the more limited her potential transformations would be; he noted to himself that she had not made the connection between Luffy and Nika. Saturn then saw that Luffy had somehow obtained food and ordered the Marines to stop him (not realizing it was Kizaru)
; he then heard reports that Kuma had landed on Egghead, but dismissed it as impossible. As Bonney's spirit broke down, Saturn moved to execute her by throwing her to the ground and impaling her with his claw, but Kuma indeed arrived and threw himself in the claw's path before removing it from his body and aiming a punch toward Saturn.
Saturn was left aghast that the self-destruct switch had not worked and questioned what Vegapunk had done as Kuma planted his
Armament Haki
-covered fist into the Elder's face, sending him tumbling back many meters into the city; Saturn crashed through several buildings which then fell on top of him.
Saturn impales Vegapunk.
Saturn quickly emerged from the wreckage with severe facial injury and his right arm torn off, but quickly regenerated back to full health. He questioned Vegapunk again about the switch, but the scientist could only offer the power of love as an answer. Saturn moved to attack Kuma and Bonney again, but his leg was kicked away by Sanji before Franky pierced through his torso with a laser. Saturn and Kizaru officially activated a
Buster Call
against Egghead,
and Saturn instructed the Marines that only the two of them would remain on the island while the rest of them evacuated before the bombardment. Vegapunk tried pleading for Saturn to spare the many scientific achievements on the island, but the Elder showed no remorse. Franky and Atlas had attempted to take Bonney and Kuma up to the Labophase during this time, but were sent falling back down by Kizaru, and Saturn ordered the Pacifista to shoot down Bonney and Kuma.
However, it turned out that Vegapunk had secretly programmed Bonney to be the highest authority source for the Pacifista, allowing her to turn them back to her side. In response, Saturn promptly impaled Vegapunk through his back.
Luffy then appeared in Gear 5 form again, and Bonney recognized him as Nika before telling him to punch Saturn. Luffy promptly did so, pummeling the Elder with a barrage of inflated fists and sending him crashing into a building. As he moved the rubble away, Saturn found himself with
Catarina Devon
and
Van Augur
of the
Blackbeard Pirates
, and Devon touched his leg. Noting their leader
Marshall D. Teach
's special bloodline, Saturn asked the duo what they were after, to which they responded the world. Saturn moved to attack them, but Augur
warped
himself and Devon away.
Saturn then returned to his original spot in his full Beast Form, finding only Vegapunk, Luffy, and Sanji. Saturn rapidly attacked all three of them at once, and Kizaru was able to finish off Vegapunk with a laser in the midst of the chaos. Luffy then entered his Gigant form and held both Saturn and Kizaru at bay to allow Sanji to take Vegapunk away; right then, a message from Vegapunk began broadcasting across the world.
The Five Elders confront Luffy.
The other Elders were alarmed at this development and quickly concluded that the broadcast was coming from somewhere in the Labophase. Saturn resumed attacking Luffy, but the pirate was able to smash Saturn and Kizaru into flat disks before throwing them back toward the fleet; however, Saturn quickly recovered and remained on Egghead. To assist himself in finding and stopping the broadcast, he summoned the other Elders to his side.
Once they all manifested on Egghead, Nusjuro and Mars went off on their own while Warcury and Peter stayed to assist Saturn against Luffy; however, Luffy was soon joined by the giant pirates
Dorry
and
Brogy
.
After the giants overwhelmed Peter and Warcury, Saturn spat out explosive venom projectiles, but Luffy manifested a baseball bat and hit them back at the Elders, who regenerated following the explosions.
Afterwards, Saturn made his way up to the Labophase where he confronted
Nico Robin
,
Nami
,
Usopp
,
Chopper
,
Brook
, and
Lilith
with the purpose of killing Robin.
However, Vegapunk's waiting period before his message officially began had just ended and the Elders had not found the transmission where they expected it, forcing Saturn to hurry and wildly attack the group to get to Robin, but they successfully defended her against his claws.
With the Elders now desperate as Vegapunk began revealing what he knew about the Void Century, Saturn left the Straw Hat group and headed to the Mother Flame power plant where he started killing any
Den Den Mushi
he saw.
Saturn is pummeled by Bonney and Luffy.
Eventually York contacted the Elders, having deduced that Vegapunk put the transmission source under the protection of the Iron Giant
Emet
, which was moving around the Fabiriophase down below.
Saturn, Warcury, Mars, and Peter all went to confront Emet and Warcury sent it flying into the ocean by ramming it, causing the broadcast to stop.
The Elders then moved to stop the Straw Hats from escaping aboard the
Giant Warrior Pirates
' ship, but Emet emerged from the sea to oppose them, with Vegapunk's broadcast resuming in the process. Saturn leaped onto the giants' ship to confront Bonney and Kuma,
forcing the crew to defend against his attacks. However, Saturn then discovered to his shock that Bonney had successfully achieved her own Nika transformation, and with Luffy's encouragement as well as the memories of what Saturn took from her, Bonney struck the Elder with an inflated fist to go along with Luffy's own barrage of punches. The combined attack blew several holes in Saturn's body and sent him flying back onto Egghead.
Saturn regenerated without issue and Warcury ended the broadcast by goring Emet and killing the Den Den Mushi inside it, but the world had ultimately heard the majority of what Vegapunk wished to say. The Elders mounted a last desperate charge against the Straw Hats and their allies, but Emet untied a knot containing
Joy Boy
's
Supreme King Haki
, engulfing all of Egghead in a powerful blast. The Haki forced all of the Elders out of their transformations and sent all of them except Saturn back to Mary Geoise, leaving Saturn alone on Egghead with the deactivated Iron Giant as the Straw Hats, Kuma, and Bonney successfully escaped.
Saturn is killed by Imu for letting Joy Boy get away.
Following the escape of the Straw Hats and their allies, Saturn made his way back onto a Marine ship, where he was approached by the Vice Admirals. They apologized profusely for their failure to prevent the escape, and requested to pursue the pirates to
Elbaph
. Saturn rebuffed them, explaining that Vegapunk's broadcast was the bigger threat at the moment. When asked by Doberman about the validity of the broadcast, Saturn used his ability to severely injure him out of rage. Moments later, Imu would strip Saturn of his apparent immortality for allowing
"Joy Boy"
to escape. Saturn begged for his life, but withered away nonetheless, with only his skeleton being left behind, to the horror of the vice admirals present with him.
Legacy
At the same time as Saturn's death,
Figarland Garling
would take on his position, replacing him as the Warrior God of Science and Defense.
