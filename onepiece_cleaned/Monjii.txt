History

Past
[
]
When the
Beasts Pirates
, led by
Jack
, arrived on
Zou
in search of
Raizo
, Monjii tried to reason with them, but Jack angrily rejected his attempt at diplomacy. After the Pleasures attacked and were repelled by the
minks
, Monjii revealed that all the minks were warriors from birth and tried to convince Jack to talk to
Inuarashi
in order to avoid a war that would cause both sides to suffer greatly, but Jack refused and ordered the Gifters to attack.
The battle against the Beast Pirates lasted for five days. On the fifth day of the battle, Jack lost his patience and unleashed
Caesar Clown
's
Koro
gas, which left the Mink Tribe poisoned and drastically weakened. The following day, Jack left Zou after hearing about
Donquixote Doflamingo
's defeat and capture,
and the minks were later saved when
Sanji
and his group came to Zou.
Zou Arc
[

After the other
Straw Hat Pirates
came to Zou, Monjii took part in a feast with them while offering Zoro some wine.
The following day, as
Bariete
rang the bell and spoke of the arrival of samurai, Monjii and the rest of the minks rushed to Kurau City. When
Kin'emon
and
Kanjuro
revealed themselves, Monjii and the minks welcomed them and revealed that
Raizo
was on
Zou
before standing proudly at having kept his presence a secret.
When Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, the samurais, and the pirates returned from the Whale Tree with Raizo, Zou began shaking as
Zunesha
started crying out, throwing Monjii and the others into a state of panic.
Jack had returned and was attempting to destroy Zou by killing Zunesha, who retaliated on
Kouzuki Momonosuke
's command and sank Jack's fleet with one blow, calming down Monjii and the others in the process.
