The subject of this article is sometimes called
Django
.
Jango the Turncoat
is a hypnotist and
Marine
lieutenant commander
serving under
Rear Admiral
Hina
. He was formerly the
captain
of the
Black Cat Pirates
and
Captain Kuro
's
first mate
, known as
"One-Two" Jango
.
After being pardoned for his crimes with the help of
Fullbody
, he decided to enlist in the Marines with his newfound friend.
Due to his actions, Jango can be considered the secondary antagonist of the
Syrup Village Arc
. He is also the protagonist of the
Jango's Dance Paradise
Cover Page Serial.
Appearance
[
]
Jango is a skinny, blondish-gray haired man who appears to favor strange, flamboyant clothes; the most notable of these are his red, heart-shaped glasses, which disguise his heart-shaped eyes and matching eyebrows.
According to
Eiichiro Oda
, the striped, beard-like growth on his chin is actually the stem of a mushroom that grew while he was sleeping (Jango having eaten the cap, but finding it so disgusting that he left the rest alone).
As Kuro's first mate, he was known to favor a simple sleeveless shirt and blue bandanna. After being "promoted" to captain, he favored a blue, wide-brimmed hat, olive-green trousers (with similarly colored gloves), and black shoes with tall white socks. He combined these with a simple blue jacket when travelling incognito, but wore a larger, more imposing overcoat lined with ring-like decorations when acting in his "official" capacity as captain.
Once he joined the Marines, Jango began wearing even gaudier articles—most notably a bright purple-and-yellow giraffe-patterned shirt—with the standard Marine Seaman cap.

Personality
[
]
Jango is a powerful yet somewhat bumbling hypnotist. He is mostly carefree and was fully aware of Kuro's tendency to lash out at even his own crew mates (leaving Jango to feel uneasy being around him). Jango was loyal to Kuro, even knowing his Captain could kill him at any moment and went along with any plans of his.
Jango seems to love dancing, often implementing dance moves in his routine, such as moonwalking instead of walking regularly. While in disguise at
Mirrorball Island
, he recklessly entered a local dance contest, forgetting that he had to avoid attention from the Marines. As a dancer, he was shown to be competitive and passionate enough to win the contest in the end, earning Fullbody's respect in the process.
As a Marine, he takes the role of
Hina
's admirer and
Fullbody
's friend. While they have become friends through a rather bizarre set of circumstances, Fullbody and Jango have become inseparable and are always together on appearances. Often Jango and Fullbody will copy each other or dance beside each other in sync.
Like many characters, Jango has a unique
Laughter Style
: Uhyahahya.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Originally, Jango was loyal to his former pirate captain,
Kuro
, as Jango was willing to take over captaincy of the crew, and return three years later to instigate the plan, despite seemingly knowing of his captain's darker personality. As for the rest of the crew, they seem to respect him enough to follow his orders, and Jango seems to show no cruelty towards them. Now, as a Marine, the Black Cat Pirates and Jango are enemies.
Marines
[
]
Jango is currently good friends with
Fullbody
, as they participated in the dance competition together and cooperated to defeat invading
pirates
. Fullbody also helped save Jango from his death sentence. Jango is romantically attracted to his commanding officer,
Hina
, but she rebuffs his advances to get with her.
Enemies
[
]
Jango is the
Straw Hat Pirates
' enemy, both because he threatened
Kaya
's life as a pirate and his duty to fight against and arrest pirates as a Marine.
Usopp
, in particular, bears a grudge against him.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Having been a prominent member and acting captain of the Black Cat Pirates for several years, Jango is decently athletic and possesses some degree of combat ability and leadership skills. In melee combat, he has been seen using long, exaggerated kicks not unlike dance moves.
Back when he was a pirate, he had a bounty of
9,000,000, a rather pitiful amount by
Grand Line
standards, but three times the average bounty in his home ocean, the
East Blue
. However, despite this relatively high bounty, Jango is not particularly formidable; notably, it took
Usopp
only one Gunpowder Star to defeat him.
It is unknown what (if any) improvements he has made to his overall combat abilities since becoming a Marine, though by the time after the timeskip, he was able to rise through the ranks of the navy, going from a mere Seaman Recruit to the position of Lieutenant Commander after only two years.
During the
Summit War of Marineford
, he proved weak-willed enough to succumb to Luffy's burst of
Supreme King Haki
.
Hypnotism
[
]
Demonstrating for
Ninjin
,
Piiman
, and
Tamanegi
, Jango inadvertently falls under his own spell.
After eating a mushroom that had grown on his chin,
Jango developed the ability to influence and control others through his hypnosis, as long as he makes them watch the swinging of his pendulum, listen to the orders he gives them, and listen to the phrase he uses to make his hypnosis take effect:
One, Two, Jango
(
ワン・ツー・ジャンゴ
,
Wan, Tsū, Jango
?
)
. When successful, he can hypnotize enemies to fall asleep, incapacitating them quickly and easily, as well as aid allies by commanding them to tap into subconscious reserves of strength, which actually does make them physically stronger in addition to boosting their morale.
However, his hypnosis is largely useless against anyone aware of its dangers, as even
Kaya
was able to protect herself simply by closing her eyes. Conversely, Jango himself often forgets to close his eyes (or drop his hat-brim in front of his eyes) when issuing commands, resulting in frequent and embarrassing episodes of self-hypnosis.
In any case, the full capacity of his hypnosis is unknown, as most of his successful commands were rudimentary, and performed on either the simpleminded (
e.g.
himself, Luffy) or willing subjects (
e.g.
his subordinates). His initial meeting with Fullbody, however, implied that he could manage something as complex as erasing all memory of an individual (
i.e.
himself) from another's mind.

In the anime, by the time of the war against Whitebeard in Marineford, Jango has started using a second pendulum which he claims doubles the strength of his hypnotic powers.

Weapons
[

The pendulum that Jango uses to perform his hypnosis is, in fact, a
chakram
(
チャクラム
,
Chakuramu
?
)
on a string.
It is made of sturdy metal, with an edge sharp enough to cut through tree trunks in one swing; Jango can wield it in one hand, spin it on his finger, or throw it as a projectile. He also makes sure to carry several spares in case something happens to the first.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Before he was a pirate, Jango was a wandering dancer. Unfortunately, he was usually poor. When Jango was sleeping, a mushroom grew on his chin. Finding the taste disgusting, he ate only the cap and left the trunk on there. Eating the cap is apparently what gave him his powerful hypnotism.
Jango served as the first mate of the
Black Cat Pirates
, until one day his captain Kuro grew tired of constantly being on the run from the
Marines
and decided to retire and give captaincy to Jango. Jango hypnotized
Nugire Yainu
, the crew's
shipwright
who bears sufficient similarities to Kuro, into believing that he was Kuro, and also hypnotized
Morgan
, the sole surviving Marine whose platoon was slaughtered by the Black Cat Pirates' captain, into believing he captured the real Kuro (Yainu) and took him to execution, so Kuro may have his bounty retracted and leave the pirate life. Jango then took the mantle of captaincy and trained by Kuro to survive without him but was instructed to return to
Syrup Village
with the crew three years later as a ploy for Kuro to inherit an estate from a
rich girl
. What the crew was not informed was that Kuro intended to murder them all as well, to ensure his true identity would remain in the dark.
East Blue Saga
[
]
Syrup Village Arc
[
]
Kuro and Jango go over the plan.
Jango first appeared walking strangely backwards through
Usopp
's hometown of
Syrup Village
.
Later, he met with his former captain,
Kuro
, to help carry out his 3 year plan to kill
Kaya
and inherit her wealth. When Usopp and Luffy overheard the plan, Jango put Luffy to sleep and allowed Usopp to escape under Kuro's orders, because no one would believe him as he was the village liar.
Jango is defeated by Usopp.
Jango was ordered by Kuro to hypnotize Kaya into writing her will, then kill her after it is done, so that Kuro inherits everything. Jango was put in charge of the
Black Cat Pirates
who were to invade the village and kill Kaya to remove any suspicion from Kuro.
However, the
Straw Hat Pirates
intervention delayed the Black Cat Pirates and Kuro,
unable to wait any longer, headed for the shore to take matters into his own hands.
Kaya arrived to convince Kuro to leave, but failed and Usopp ordered the
Usopp Pirates
to take her into the forest.
Jango pursued them,
and planned on killing them before Kaya threatened to kill herself if they were harmed any further. Jango agreed to let them go if Kaya wrote the will but warned them that they would most likely not survive with Kuro willing to kill everyone who knows his true nature. Kaya signed the will, but before Jango could kill her, Zoro cut a small tree branch out of the way so Usopp could shoot him with a
Kayaku Boshi
, knocking him out. While Luffy threw Kuro to his retreating crew, Jango was left where he fell.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Jango's Dance Paradise
[
]
Jango woke up, too late to get on the ship, and the Usopp Pirates chased him off the island. He made his way to a nearby island and, after disguising himself, entered and won a dance contest. He celebrated his victory with Fullbody, who did not recognize him, and he realized that Fullbody is a Marine.
When pirates attacked the town and Fullbody fought against them, Jango initially fled to avoid the danger the pirates presented and to avoid being captured by Fullbody. The pirates took a woman hostage to prevent Fullbody from fighting back, but Jango saved the woman and defeated the pirates together with Fullbody. His identity revealed, Jango surrendered and was sentenced to death as a pirate, but Fullbody's "friendship dance" managed to secure an acquittal. Jango then went to hypnotize Fullbody into forgetting their friendship, but the sight of
Hina
stopped him before he could. He and Fullbody went on to enlist in her Marine unit out of admiration for her.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Jango and Fullbody at Marineford.
In the anime, Jango and Fullbody spring into action and attack Luffy as he charges forward. Jango attempts to hypnotize Luffy into falling asleep but due to a distant cannon fire distracting Luffy at the last moment, it failed. The attempt also backfires on Fullbody and himself, causing them to get kicked aside by Hina for their incompetence. Later in the anime, the scene of Jango fainting when Luffy unleashed a burst of Haki was omitted.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
While
Jango
is largely accepted as the
canonical
spelling of his name (per
Chapter 136
's
cover
depiction of his wanted poster), both the
Viz-translated manga
and the
4Kids anime
romanize it with a silent "D", as
Django
; the reason for this is unknown, but may be an homage to
the iconic "Spaghetti Western" character of the same name
.
In addition, the 4Kids anime gives his speech heavy
Beatnik
tics, overemphasizing words such as "groovy"; his personality is also made less gullible, as time constraints shortened his second confrontation with
Usopp
so that he immediately sees through the latter's "8,000 men" lie. More bizarrely, it - as a means of censoring
Kaya
's suicide threat in the original storyline - implies that his chakrams are sentient and can "turn on" inexperienced users.
In the Odex dub, Jango's name is pronounced and spelt as Jango, but his signature attack is written as "one, two, jingle!" in the subtitles, despite the voice line clearly still saying Jango. Also, in
Episode 10
, Usopp bizarrely comments "Yeah, he looks like
Michael Jackson!
" presumably referring to the real life singer.
