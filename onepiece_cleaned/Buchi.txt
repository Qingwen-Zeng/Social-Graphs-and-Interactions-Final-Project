Appearance
[
]
Buchi is an overweight man who wears an outfit based loosely on a black and white cat. He has pale skin, sharp teeth, tiny eyes, and wears cat ears on his head. His pants are striped black and white, with a yellow sash, and also wears dark brown shoes. He wears a cape on his back, that is striped light and dark-purple, with a white fluffy brim. He also wears a shoulder pad on his left arm, and pale blue gloves with claws at the end.
Personality
[
]
Like
Sham
, Buchi has a sneaky and devious mind. This is shown when he pretended to be weak, lacking in confidence in his abilities, and scared of
Zoro
, in order to get the latter to lower his guard. He is also very vicious and proud of his powers and like his appearance, Buchi acts like a cat.
Like his brother, he does not show genuine loyalty towards Kuro, showing himself offended by classifying them as weak, trusting himself because Kuro had been inactive for three years and tried to attack his former captain.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Buchi hypnotized.
The Nyaban Brothers try to act cowardly when first approaching an opponent, but show their true colors once their opponent's guard is down.
The two usually work together to overpower their opponents, and can surpass Jango when doing so.
Their primary weapons are the clawed gloves they wear, which they use to slash their opponents. Buchi is the strength of the duo, using his heavy weight to crush his opponents while
Sham
distracts and restrains them.
Even without any boost, Buchi was strong enough to crack rocks with a hard stomp.
However, after being defeated,
Jango
hypnotizes Buchi into becoming even more powerful, being able to shatter rock with one jump.
Despite this increase in strength, he is defeated once again by
Zoro
.

History
[

Past
[
]
Some time in the past, Buchi joined the
Black Cat Pirates
and eventually met
Sham
, with whom he eventually joined together to become the Nyaban Brothers. Afterwards, the two of them rose up the ranks and became officers of their crew.
Together, Buchi and
Sham
served as the ship's protectors so they usually stayed on the ship and guarded it.
Three years prior to their planned invasion of Syrup Village, they sailed towards the Marine ship that
Kuro
had decided to attack alone, only to find that Kuro had killed everyone on board except a lone
Marine
. They then watched as Kuro initiated his plan to abandon his pirate life.
East Blue Saga

Syrup Village Arc
[
]
After
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Roronoa Zoro
defeated the
Black Cat Pirates
as they tried to run up the slope leading to
Syrup Village
,
Jango
called down Buchi and
Sham
to finish the fight. Upon hearing their names, Buchi wondered why their crew were still there and then leapt off the ship after seeing that their crew had been defeated. After being ordered by Jango to take out the ones blocking their path, both Buchi and Sham complained that their enemies looked to powerful, with Buchi further saying that they didn't want to be part of the battle.
Sham and Buchi attack Zoro.
Despite their cries, Jango made Sham go on the offensive and, while Sham was attacking Zoro, Buchi watched as his partner revealed their true capabilities. As soon as Sham gained the upper hand and restrained Zoro, Buchi sprung into action and jumped into the air to slam Zoro to the ground with his Cat the Funjyatta attack. However, before he could strike down on Zoro, the swordsman dodged the attack, causing the ground to split instead.
With his attack dodged, Buchi complained to Sham about how he should have held him down better. The two then charged at Zoro while using their Neko-Yanagi Daikoshin attack, which proved to be a struggle for Zoro as he only had one sword.
They kept attacking and eventually got a cut in when Zoro got distracted defending
Usopp
and
Nami
. However, before the two could continue their duel with Zoro, they paused in fear after their former captain arrives.
Kuro sneaks up behind the Nyaban Brothers.
An enraged
Kuro
then called the entire crew useless for being held up by a bunch of kids. Hearing this, the Nyaban Brothers became angered that they were being called useless and then started to question Kuro's own capabilities. Upon hearing this, Buchi demanded that Kuro not look down at them and pointed out that they had attacked many villages and ships. He then stated how Kuro could not possibly be stronger than them after three years of inactivity. Claiming that he was no longer their captain, the two then charged at Kuro and attempted to get an attack in. To their horror, Kuro disappeared behind them, and before they could properly respond, Kuro had already wrapped his cat claws around their necks.
Kuro then began slowly shoving his sword into Buchi's neck, to which Buchi cried out in pain. However, Kuro then granted them five minutes to finish off Zoro and the others, or otherwise, he would kill all of them. Hearing this, Buchi recalled how Zoro was no match for them just minutes ago, and as such became confident in their abilities to finish him off. The two leapt towards Zoro and, upon seeing him regain his two other swords, stated how he would be no match for them even with three swords. However, before they could strike Zoro, the swordsman slashed through them with his Tora Gari, sending the two spiraling down towards the ground.
Although Sham had been knocked unconscious, Buchi immediately got back up, albeit severely injured, and asked Jango to hypnotize him.
After his hypnosis, Buchi became even stronger than before and was ordered by Jango to finish off Zoro. He eventually attacked Zoro with his signature flying stomp, but was dodged yet again, and instead, shattering the entire cliff. He then rammed Zoro into the side of the cliff wall using one arm, but Zoro easily defended against it and kicked him backwards in the face.
When Usopp began approaching Kuro, Kuro ordered Buchi to take him out, but before he could, Zoro held Buchi back and slammed him to the ground. In response, Buchi then flung Zoro off him and sent the latter flying into the cliffside. Buchi then charged at him again, but by now, Zoro had become impatient and demanded that he get out of the way. Zoro then slashed straight through Buchi, defeating him once again.
After Kuro's defeat, the rest of the crew carried Buchi and the other injured back to the Bezan Black and sailed away from the island.
