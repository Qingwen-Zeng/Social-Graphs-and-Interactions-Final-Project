Appearance
[
]
Peepley Lulu is a muscular man with black hair and a mustache who usually wears sunglasses. He constantly has a part of his hair sticking up. When he tries to push it down, it always pops up somewhere else, such as the other side of his head, his mustache, his hand, and other people's heads. His upper body is covered with intricate tattoos, green on his chest, and red on his arms. He wears pants that have lighter colored stripes around his waist and on the top of the legs, and standard shoes. During the travel on the Rocketman, he was seen wearing an unbuttoned, brightly colored sleeveless shirt and carried a pair of katanas on his back.
After the timeskip his appearance is nearly the same, but his mustache is thinner and straighter and the part of his hair sticking up is bigger and more conical. When he learns about Franky's new bounty, the part of his hair sticking up consists of four small parts.

Personality
[

Lulu seems to take his work very seriously and he cares very much for both his fellow co-workers and employer.
While Lulu might appear serious at times, he certainly is a comic relief character, as evidenced by the gags he takes part in, such as sprouting the sticking part of his hair on his enemies in order to distract them, and appearing alongside the others with bleeding noses while peeping on
Nami
changing her clothes on the
Rocketman
.

Water 7 Arc
[
]
He was first seen meeting up with the
Straw Hats
at
Water 7
.
After the assassination attempt on
Iceburg
, he and the top five Galley La workers went to search for Luffy and his crew to defeat them and throw them in jail. They stopped attacking Luffy when
Franky
interrupted and used a Coup de Vent to destroy
Dock 1
, causing a distraction and allowing the two to escape. Later that night, they guarded the Galley La Headquarters to corner the murderer and reveal its true face. When the chaos started, he encountered
someone
with a mask on and was beaten up before they ran away.
After the assassination attempt on Iceburg was revealed to be orchestrated by
CP9
, he went with the Straw Hats to
Enies Lobby
.

Lulu was later seen riding on the
Rocketman
with the
Franky Family
, the Straw Hat Pirates, and the other shipwrights. He commented that
Kokoro
somewhat resembled a frog when she was talking with
Yokozuna
. Along with Tilestone, he then learned that the people who tried to kill Iceburg were none other than
Lucci
,
Kaku
,
Kalifa
, and
Blueno
. When the group arrived at Enies Lobby, Lulu fought off the
Marines
with
Paulie
and
Tilestone
before fighting
Oimo
and
Kashii
. Lulu and Tilestone got on Kashii's shoulders and beat his face with hammers. Later, he helped the other shipwrights hold off the Marines' canine units. When the Rocketman crashed into Oimo's back, Lulu was seen looking shocked along with everyone else, saying that opening the gate was now pointless.
Lulu later invaded the courthouse alongside the others. They encountered the
Just Eleven Jurymen
and fought them so that they could lower the drawbridge. Although they were able to defeat them and lower the bridge, they were eventually captured by reinforcements. However, before anything could be done with them, the news of the Buster Call arrived and the Marines and government officials ran, leaving Lulu and their other captives behind. Lulu was eventually freed by Paulie who pretended to have been tied up by his own rope.
Seeing as how the island was about to be destroyed, they all ran towards the island's front gate. At the gate, they encountered Vice Admiral
Strawberry
and his battleships and were blasted backwards over the cliff of Enies Lobby. They were, however, saved by Paulie's rope and remained silent, pretending to be dead as to avoid the Marines attacking. With the news of the Straw Hats' survival and victory, they came out of hiding, and Lulu and the others escaped the island on the Puffing Tom.
