"Courier" Mikita
,
more commonly known by her alias
Miss Valentine
,
is a former
officer agent
who was partnered with
Mr. 5
.
As of now, she is currently working as a chocolate lady alongside most of the other Baroque Works members at the new
Spiders Cafe
.
She is one of the main antagonists of the
Whisky Peak Arc
and a major antagonist of the
Little Garden Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Mikita is a tall young woman with short blond hair and dark eyes (bright green in the anime).
She wears a yellow and orange hat, as well as a yellow dress with a lemon-like pattern, lemon earrings, and white high-heeled shoes. She also added a blue jacket with white stripes over this attire during the
Little Garden Arc
. She is almost always seen carrying a bright green parasol with blue stripes.
Personality
[
]
Miss Valentine when being ignored by Zoro.
Overconfident, she does not take her opponents seriously and greets any situation with a lighthearted laugh. She generally allows her partner Mr. 5 to do any necessary talking. Being a Baroque Works
officer agent
, she is quite confident in her abilities.
Her chosen method of dealing with
Usopp
—crushing him slowly and painfully by increasing her weight—shows her preference for unnecessary cruelty.
She also dislikes being ignored, especially when she is attacking.
Like many other people, she possesses a
unique laugh
: "Kyahahaha".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Mikita herself displays very little combat ability beyond the simple use of her Devil Fruit power. For the most part, she lets her partner, Mr. 5, do most of the fighting while she functions as support.
However, she is strong enough to restrain
Vivi
.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Kiro Kiro no Mi
Mikita's 10,000 Kilo Press.
Mikita ate the Kiro Kiro no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
which allows her to freely manipulate her body weight at will. She can make herself weigh anywhere from 1 to 10,000 kilograms (changed to pounds in the 4Kids dub). She uses this power to make herself heavy enough to easily crush her opponents, or to make herself light enough to glide through the air by catching a breeze with her umbrella.
As she is partnered with Mr. 5, she can ride the force of his explosions and drop high from midair by suddenly increasing her weight for a devastating dive-bomb.
History
[
]
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Whisky Peak Arc
[
]
Luffy
and
Zoro
dispatch Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine with ease.
Mr. 5 and his lady partner Miss Valentine arrived at
Whisky Peak
, but were not present to aid the other, less capable agents of the organization. They reveal that the leader of Baroque Works (
Mr. 0
) has discovered a spy, who has somehow successfully infiltrated its ranks, and that they've been sent to dispatch them. The spies were none other than
Igaram
(Mr. 8, who used the alias Igarappoi as the town's leader) and Princess Nefertari Vivi (Miss Wednesday) of the
Arabasta
Kingdom.
Mr. 9
and
Miss Monday
, despite being rather unaware of the situation to their own admission, decided to hold off the Mr. 5 pair so that Vivi can escape but are quickly defeated.
When Mr. 5 fired at Vivi,
Zoro
suddenly appeared and defended her. Miss Valentine and Mr. 5 decided to assassinate Zoro thinking that he was an obstacle of their goal.
Luffy
then suddenly appeared and angrily fought Zoro.
When she and Mr. 5 were about to get near the unprotected princess, Zoro kicked Luffy and they were both hit, crashing into a building. After taking a blow, Miss Valentine tried to bury Zoro using her abilities, but she was dodged. She and Mr. 5 got up again and saw that Luffy and Zoro were still fighting. They both attacked, but were soon sent flying and knocked unconscious.
Little Garden Arc
[
]
Miss Valentine captures Vivi.
Later, Miss Valentine and Mr. 5 met up with
Mr. 3
and his partner
Miss Goldenweek
at
Little Garden
. Mr. 3 revealed the
100,000,000 bounty on
Brogy
and
Dorry
's individual heads, suggesting that they kill the
giants
along with the Straw Hats.
They caught
Karoo
and began beating him, later ordering him to call out to his master, Vivi. However, Karoo showed an iron-will and refused to make a sound.
However, Luffy was pinned under a mountain by Dorry and they were free to make their moves to capture Vivi. Later after Luffy, Usopp, Karoo arrived to save
Nami
, Vivi, and Zoro, she and Mr. 5 chased after Usopp and Karoo. Eventually, after Mr. 5 shot Usopp, Miss Valentine then tried her
Crescendo Stone
on Usopp, experimenting on how much 'weight' he can hold.
But before he got crushed, he was able to execute his plan of using an oil-soaked rope for Luffy and unwittingly Mr. 3 to ignite to free Nami, Vivi, and Zoro from their wax encasing.
Just before an angry Miss Valentine could finish off Usopp by crushing his neck, Miss Valentine's anger turned to horror and was then swiftly defeated by Nami and Vivi.

Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
[
]
She, along with Mr. 5 and Miss Goldenweek, appeared in a
chapter cover mini-story
where the three flew from Little Garden to visit their fellow Baroque Works agents in prison but wound up on an island resort swarming with Marines.
The three later tried to disguise themselves but were unsuccessful and spotted by Captain
Hina
. While Mr. 5 and Miss Goldenweek escape, Miss Valentine was captured and was about to be executed by the Marines. Luckily,
Mr. 2
showed up (disguised as Mr. 3 surrendering) and challenged Hina to a rematch, allowing Mr. 5 and Miss Goldenweek time to rescue Miss Valentine and escape.
They managed to break many agents out of prison except for
Crocodile
who refused to go with them, and
Mr. 1
, who stayed with Crocodile. They then started a new Spiders Cafe, where they all currently work.
