Jigoro of the Wind
was a
General Zombie
on
Thriller Bark
in the service of
Gecko Moria
who was eventually assigned to guard
Hogback
.
As he had
Zoro
's shadow, he was a user of
Three Sword Style
.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist in the
Thriller Bark Arc
.
Appearance
Jigoro was a middle aged man with shadowy eyes, long black hair, and a toothbrush mustache. He was missing one of his front teeth and had a thick neck, while his head was wrapped in bandages and had multiple nails going through it, as well as a bird of some kind attached to the back. He wore a yellow shirt with the words "YOUR SONG" and a red-and-black stomach band above a thick metal band with two bullet holes in it circling his hips, as well as sandals and black socks on his hairy legs.
Personality
In life, Jigoro was known to be very stubborn, but loved his family dearly and fought fiercely to protect them.
As a
zombie
, due to being animated by
Zoro
's shadow, Jigoro initially shared Zoro's belief that a wound on one's back is a swordsman's greatest shame
and held pride in his swordsmanship skills.
However, as with all zombies who complete a past erasure contract with
Gecko Moria
, Jigoro eventually lost Zoro's memories of his fellow
Straw Hat Pirates
, as well as his emotions, and became completely obedient toward his masters,
to the point of jumping out of a tower if ordered to do so.
However, he was competitive with other zombies who get in his way, such as Inuppe.
Relationships
Inuppe
Jigoro's rivalry with Inuppe reflects Zoro and Sanji's rivalry.
Initially, Jigoro managed to fight alongside
Inuppe
well enough to subdue
Tony Tony Chopper
and
Nico Robin
.
However, when one of Jigoro's attacks almost hit Inuppe, the rivalry of their shadows'
previous
owners
sparked up once more, causing them to begin clashing and arguing with each other; Chopper noted that even without their memories, their personalities were still in conflict with one another.
Abilities and Powers
In life, Jigoro was a master swordsman who killed seven thousand pirates.
Jigoro uses Three Sword Style.
As a
General Zombie
, Jigoro was much more powerful than the average
zombie
in
Thriller Bark
's ranks,
and with Zoro's shadow animating him, he could perform
Three Sword Style
and
One Sword Style
techniques, namely Sanjuroku Pound Ho
and Hyakuhachi Pound Ho;
consequently, he managed to subdue
Nico Robin
, a powerful combatant, who acknowledged his power herself.
Physically, he was strong enough to wrench himself free from Robin's
Dieciséis Fleur
in order to attack her.
However, being animated by Zoro's shadow also left Jigoro with a complete lack of orientation; when the General Zombies moved to aid
Tararan
, Jigoro ended up walking in the wrong direction.
Weapons
As a zombie, Jigoro wielded three identical cutlasses.
History
Biography
In life, Jigoro was a legendary and stubborn swordsman who killed seven thousand pirates in order to protect his family. He died at the age of 59.
Thriller Bark Arc
After
Roronoa Zoro
was captured by the
Spider Mice
,
his shadow was used to
animate
Jigoro's stolen corpse. Soon afterward, Jigoro confronted
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Nico Robin
, and
Franky
alongside the other
General Zombies
, where he attacked Luffy with
Sanjuroku Pound Ho
. Declaring that a wound on one's back was a warrior's shame, Jigoro noted that he was covered in wounds despite this and then stated his name in response to Luffy asking him if he was Zoro.
After the General Zombies followed him and Robin out onto a nearby bridge, Franky destroyed the bridge with
Coup de Vent
, causing Jigoro to fall to the ground below alongside the other General Zombies.
Shortly after
Tararan
's purification at the hands of
Brook
, Jigoro found his corpse along with the other General Zombies, which prompted him to declare that he would quickly cut up the enemies who did this.
Later, with
Absalom
occupied with his wedding,
Hogback
requested that
Gecko Moria
give him two zombies to act as his guards;
these ended up being Jigoro and
Inuppe
, who soon confronted
Tony Tony Chopper
and Robin at Hogback's behest.
Jigoro clashes with Inuppe.
Eventually, Jigoro and Inuppe managed to subdue Chopper and Robin, with Jigoro noting that he could not let his guard down against Robin due to how she tried to make him eat salt with
her powers
. When Chopper restrained
Victoria Cindry
and tried to have Robin feed her salt, Hogback ordered Jigoro and Inuppe to get rid of anyone who interfered, which prompted Jigoro to use
Hyakuhachi Pound Ho
, which was narrowly dodged by Chopper and Inuppe. Robin tried to restrain him with
Dieciséis Fleur
, but Jigoro broke free and slashed at her too, only to be attacked in turn by Inuppe, who was angered by Jigoro having seemingly attacked him previously. The two argued over their orders to get rid of anyone who interfered before engaging in earnest combat with each other, to Chopper and Robin's shock. However, Robin tricked Hogback into ordering them to jump off the tower, which prompted Jigoro and Inuppe to break through a nearby wall and fall to the ground below.
Jigoro loses his shadow to Moria.
After
Oars
was defeated by the
Straw Hat Pirates
, Moria removed Zoro's shadow from Jigoro's body to empower himself, leaving Jigoro as a lifeless corpse once more.
