History

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
When the
World Government
had ordered to eliminate
Vegapunk
, Hound, alongside
Jaygarcia Saturn
,
Kizaru
, and eight other
Vice Admirals
, led a Marine fleet to besiege the island of
Egghead
.
Saturn ordered a
Buster Call
on Egghead, prompting the Marines to evacuate.
During the attack, the
Pacifista
under Bonney's command were attacking the ships. Hound considered calling off the Buster Call as it would be a loss for the Marines to destroy the Pacifista.
Hound and the Marines later listened to Vegapunk's message being broadcasted to the world. He was enraged at Vegapunk's prediction that the world will sink underwater, dismissing it as nonsense.
As the
Giant Warrior Pirates
came to rescue the Straw Hats, Hound commanded the Marines to aim for the giants'
ship
.
Moments later, they witnessed the
Iron Giant
defending
Luffy
from
Warcury
and
Peter
.
After the Straw Hats and Giant Pirates escaped Egghead, the Vice Admirals met with Saturn about what to do next. Saturn explained that their biggest concern was not the pirates, but that Vegapunk's broadcast had reached the world. However, Saturn's body suddenly started withering away by
Imu
's powers. The Vice Admirals tried to help him, but his body subsequently exploded with only his skeleton remaining.
