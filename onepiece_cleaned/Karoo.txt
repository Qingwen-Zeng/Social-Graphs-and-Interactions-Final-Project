Karoo
is
Nefertari Vivi
's
pet
super spot-billed duck
, a fleet riding bird (one of the fastest modes of transportation available in the
Arabasta Kingdom
).
Alongside his owner Vivi, Karoo infiltrated the organization known as
Baroque Works
. With her, he ended up traveling with the
Straw Hat Pirates
for most of the
Arabasta Saga
after their cover was blown. He is the leader of the
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
in Arabasta.
Appearance
[
]
Karoo is a duck of yellow-brown plumage, with black-tipped wings and tailfeathers. Typical of his species, he bears a black band around his bill and stands roughly as tall as the average
human
; his feet are tetradactyl, with ostrich-like talons (unlike the webbed feet of normal ducks).
His default wear consists of a blue-and-white
chullo
(typically unbuckled), pink goggles, and a large saddle carrying multiple saddlebags.
When travelling, he prefers to wear a barrel-shaped canteen around his neck, complete with drinking-straw.

Personality
[
]
Karoo mistakenly runs past Zoro, instead of towards him.
For the most part a comic-relief figure, Karoo is generally intelligent enough to grasp most
human
speech and situations, but often engages in bizarre—sometimes dimwitted—behavior, up to misinterpreting some of Vivi's simplest commands. As a counterbalance to his headstrong mistress, he is also easily frightened, easily shrinking—if not outright fleeing—at signs of danger.
At the same time, Karoo is undyingly loyal to Vivi, and by extension both the
Arabasta Kingdom
and the
Straw Hat Pirates
. In times of need, he has always embraced this loyalty over any fears, unflinchingly risking his life on multiple occasions, up to and including using his own body as a shield.
Karoo's loyalty to his friends has also made him very determined to help in any way he possibly can both in and out of battle.
Examples of this include how he helped
Luffy
and
Usopp
to defeat the
Baroque Works
agents in
Little Garden
, how he arrived with the
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
to help the Straw Hats out of the desert and save Vivi from
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
in Arabasta.
Despite this, Karoo, like Vivi genuinely cared for the Straw Hats and became very attached to them, as he tearfully parted ways with them alongside Vivi, and has been seen happily keeping tabs on their exploits alongside her as well.
When given the opportunity, he can also prove something of a glutton, and has been known to ignore Vivi's orders on conserving water even during long desert travels.
Relationships
[
]
Nefertari Vivi
[
]
Karoo has been the
pet
and friend of
Vivi
since the
princess
's childhood. He has always been attached to her, even joining her in infiltrating
Baroque Works
. In the
Arabasta Kingdom
, he shows his love for her by protecting her from the rebels and taking her over to
Alubarna
.
When given a command, he sometimes does exactly what he is told to do such as extending one hand, and sometimes does exactly the opposite such as drinking a large amount of water despite Vivi telling him to conserve his water in the desert.
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
[
]
Karoo is the leader of the
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
. The troops are very loyal to Karoo and Vivi, so much so that they assisted them and the Straw Hats in traveling through the desert, and later in the fight against Baroque Works. The newest member,
Matsuge
, also helped in the fight against Baroque Works and has been very close with the two ever since, even sometimes seen shopping with them.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
With the Straw Hats, Vivi and Karoo don their famed mark of friendship.
Karoo never held any true hostility for the
Straw Hat Pirates
, even when Vivi opposed them as Miss Wednesday; once they became allies, he was accepted aboard the
Going Merry
as easily as his mistress. The crew's carefree nature delighted him, and he especially enjoyed the company of
Luffy
,
Usopp
, and
Chopper
(who could, uniquely,
translate
all his articulations into human speech). Despite his generally combat-shy nature, he also made every effort to help them battle
Baroque Works
, serving as
Usopp
's mount on
Little Garden
and proudly donning their arm-sign to deflect
Mr. 2
's impersonations.
In turn, Karoo was appreciated by the Straw Hats as a valuable—and amusing—friend, no less a crewmate than Vivi. Even so, they were not above occasionally bullying or exploiting him (Luffy and Usopp even using him as fishing bait in at least one instance).
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As captain of the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops, Karoo boasts the peak of his species' natural speed and stamina (famed as the highest among all of the
Arabasta Kingdom
's land creatures) being considered the fastest of the group, and well-trained in carrying and acclimating riders. With only a small supply of water, he can cross many kilometers of desert in less than a day; when pushed to his limits, he has been known to outmaneuver gunshots, and even scale sheer cliffsides with his talons.
Karoo's body is also remarkably durable as a whole, as he took multiple beatings from
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
on
Little Garden
after the pair tried to use him as bait against the Straw Hats and Vivi and failed, and even survived Mr. 5's
explosive attacks
with surprisingly minimal injuries, to the point that he not only regained consciousness, but actively helped the Straw Hats fight the two of them, as well as
Mr. 3
and
Miss Goldenweek
despite still being injured. He was also capable of surviving a stampede of fully-loaded warhorses—compounded by a bullet wound—completely unarmored. His bill, is also quite strong, as he managed to used it to help dig Luffy free from being pinned underneath a mountain by a Giant. His wings, while incapable of genuine flight, are strong enough to keep himself (and a rider) aloft for several seconds if beaten quickly; their pinion feathers are dexterous enough to act as makeshift fingers, and manipulate tools as complex as scissors.
Nevertheless, Karoo possesses very little capacity for actual combat, even when directly coordinating with Vivi. At times, he has been known to confuse maneuvers as simple as charging a stationary enemy.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Vivi and Karoo when they were very young.
Only two years younger than
Vivi
, Karoo has lived as her personal pet for at least eight years, and is possibly her oldest friend and companion.
In time, he was appointed captain of the
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
, an elite group of Super Spot-Billed Ducks used for special assignments by the
Arabasta Kingdom
's
royal family
.
When Vivi learned of
Baroque Works
' plot against Arabasta and infiltrated its ranks as "Miss Wednesday" (along with
Igaram
, "Mr. 8"), Karoo followed his mistress, serving as her faithful battle-mount.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Whisky Peak Arc
[
]
Karoo carries Vivi ("Miss Wednesday") into battle against Zoro.
Within two years of infiltration, Karoo, Vivi, and Igaram were established at
Whisky Peak
, a frontier town populated entirely by Baroque Works' lower-ranked
bounty hunters
and
assassins
. When the
Straw Hat Pirates
dropped anchor, the town launched a collective attack, but were singlehandedly beaten by
Roronoa Zoro
; Karoo's efforts were especially incompetent, as he misheard nearly all of Vivi's commands, and eventually ran her (and himself) straight off a rooftop.
Shortly after, Vivi and Igaram were confronted by
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
, revealing that
the head of Baroque Works
had learned of their infiltration, and ordered their immediate deaths.
As the pair attacked, Karoo took Vivi on a panicked sprint through Whisky Peak, narrowly evading the Officer Agents until they were (semi-accidentally) defeated by Zoro and
Monkey D. Luffy
.
Ultimately, Karoo and Vivi would escape Whisky Peak under the protection of the Straw Hats—the result of a hasty, desperate negotiation between Igaram and
Nami
. Though privy to none of the details, Karoo ironically agreed quicker than Vivi, and boarded the
Going Merry
long before her or the Straw Hats.
Little Garden Arc
[
]
Karoo, Vivi and Luffy meet and dine with Dorry the Giant.
Per the standard
Log Pose
route, the Going Merry next reached the savage, prehistoric isle of
Little Garden
. Intrigued by its jungles, both Luffy and Vivi disembarked to explore, obligating Karoo to reluctantly join them.
Together, they encountered many extraordinary creatures, culminating in the dueling
giants
Dorry
and
Brogy
.
At first terrified, Vivi and Karoo cautiously accepted the Giants' good-cheer and hospitality, all the while unaware that Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine—now joined with
Mr. 3
and
Miss Goldenweek
—had already pursued them to the island.
Working in secret, the Baroque Works agents laced Dorry's drink with explosives, severely injuring the Giant and turning his suspicions on the Straw Hats and Vivi.
Panicked, Karoo fled into the nearby jungles, only to be captured by Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine. As the pair cajoled him to call for Vivi, Karoo realized he was being used to bait a trap, and stubbornly resisted, even as they started beating him. His effort was in vain, however, as Dorry soon pinned Luffy under a mountain, allowing Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine to directly overpower and abduct Vivi.
Karoo, Luffy and Usopp run to save their friends.
Having passed out during the beatings, Karoo was discarded beside the helpless Luffy and a similarly-beaten
Usopp
. However, Luffy's drive to save Vivi and avenge the Giants revived him, and he painstakingly dug Luffy free with his bill.
Rallying anew, Karoo and the two Straw Hats rushed into battle against their Baroque Works adversaries—now the captors of not only Vivi, but Nami, Zoro, and Brogy as well.
While Luffy fought Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek—as well as the
giant candle-set
designed to suffocate their captives—Karoo and Usopp fell back to (relative) safety, providing support fire while dodging Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine.
Once Karoo was attuned to carrying Usopp, they easily outpaced the agents, but were eventually downed by Mr. 5's
invisible breath-bullets
. Nevertheless, Karoo gathered the strength to follow one more order from Usopp: to sprint around Mr. 3's candle-set and crisscross it with an oil-soaked rope. This gambit helped Luffy and unintenionally Mr. 3 burn down the entire set with a single flame, freeing the captives just seconds before full suffocation.
Outmaneuvered, Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek fled deeper into the jungle, with Karoo and Luffy—still determined to avenge the Giants—in pursuit. After Mr. 3 was downed by Luffy, Karoo found and drove off Miss Goldenweek by himself.
He and Luffy then took her remaining rice crackers and threw a small party with Usopp and the others.
Drum Island Arc
[
]
The Straw Hats give a toast the newest member of their crew, Chopper.
Within a day of leaving Little Garden, Nami fell ill, spurring the crew (at Vivi's insistence) to detour in search of a doctor. During this time, Karoo helped watch over the bedridden Nami until the Merry chanced on the permanently winter-bound
Drum Island
.
While the rest of the crew disembarked, Karoo stayed behind with Zoro to guard the Merry; to his horror, Zoro soon grew bored, and began a new training regimen of ice-swimming through the local rivers.
Fearing that Zoro would freeze in the frigid waters, Karoo jumped after him, but only succeeded in freezing himself. He was not discovered until Nami was cured and the crew returned to the Merry with new recruit
Tony Tony Chopper
; after a horrified Vivi revived him, his explanations were translated by Chopper, earning Zoro (who tried to claim it an accident) a fresh beating from Nami.
Arabasta Arc
[
]
As the Merry resumed course for Arabasta, Karoo joined Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper on a kitchen raid, emptying all the food stores in one night; for this, all four were heavily punished by Nami and Sanji.
Over the next few days, they were forced to fish for new provisions—a fresh ordeal for Karoo, as Luffy and Usopp decided to use him to bait their lines. Unsurprisingly, Karoo failed to attract any fish, though he did by sheer chance "catch" a passenger from
an adjacent ship
: Baroque Works'
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
.
This brief encounter alerted the crew to Mr. 2's
shapeshifting abilities
, and Karoo joined all the others in donning a white armband (with hidden "X") as proof of their true compatriots.
On reaching Arabasta proper and confirming civil war was imminent, Vivi sent Karoo on a special mission: while she and the others tried to conciliate
Koza
's rebel army at
Yuba
, he was to cross directly to
Alubarna
's royal palace with a letter detailing everything known of Baroque Works and Crocodile's plans.
Despite the desert's many perils, Karoo succeeded in record time, receiving much praise (and water) from
Chaka
,
Pell
, and
Nefertari Cobra
.
Karoo assembles the rest of the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops.
By the following day, unfortunately, Baroque Works'
endgame
was proceeding apace, with Luffy defeated and nearly killed by Crocodile, Cobra kidnapped from the palace and impersonated by Mr. 2, and the rebels (who had quit Yuba months earlier) closing in for a total assault on Alubarna. Sensing that the crew needed further help, Karoo led the entire
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
to meet them on Alubarna's outskirts.
Thinking quickly, the Straw Hats collectively volunteered as decoys, each riding a duck (and donning an identical cloak) to lure away the Officer Agents posted near Alubarna's gates. This allowed Vivi and Karoo to meet the approaching rebels alone, but all hopes of conciliation were dashed when a Baroque Works agitator in the Royal Guard "accidentally" fired a cannon on the rebels, obscuring them in smoke. With only seconds to react, Karoo threw himself atop Vivi, using his own body to shield her from the rebels' charging horses.
As the rebels flooded Alubarna, "Usopp"—actually Mr. 2—met Vivi and the badly-trampled Karoo, callously dismissing the latter. Suspicious, Vivi confirmed his real identity through his (lack of) arm-sign; to their mutual surprise, this revived Karoo enough to speed Vivi away. With Mr. 2 in pursuit, the adrenaline-rushed Karoo managed to scale the almost-sheer Alubarna plateau, even using his pinion feathers to climb over the top. On entering the city, Karoo was quickly downed by a stray bullet; nevertheless, his efforts allowed Sanji and two of the other Spot-Billed Duck Troops enough time to double back, and head off Mr. 2.
Karoo and Vivi bid goodbye to the Straw Hats.
With Sanji battling Mr. 2 (and Vivi rushing ahead), Karoo was delivered to medical attention by his troops, and spent the rest of the war recuperating. After Baroque Works was defeated and the war ended, he recovered enough to join the others at the Nefertari family's celebratory banquet.
The next day, he proceeded to carry Vivi through one last secret mission: a shoreside farewell to the departing Straw Hats. Though the crew could not answer aloud (for fear of
Marines
overhearing), all of them raised their arm-signs as a vow of friendship—a vow passionately returned by Karoo and his mistress.

The Great Adventure of Vivi the Pirate
A drama CD titled
The Great Adventure of Vivi the Pirate
was released in 2002, featuring a what-if scenario of Vivi becoming a
pirate
with the
Straw Hats
instead of remaining in the
Arabasta Kingdom
. In the story, Vivi's connection to the Straw Hat Pirates is uncovered and she is branded a pirate with a
bounty
of
50,000,000. She reunites with the Straw Hats at sea and decides to become a proper crew member. However, a while later, the crew is shipwrecked on a jungle island and an adventure ensues. Within the what-if scenario, Karoo is alongside Vivi as she becomes a proper member, and is by her side throughout the adventure as a part of the crew as well. At the end, however, the story is revealed to be a dream of
Luffy
.
