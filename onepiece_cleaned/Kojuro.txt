In the past, Kojuro was allied with the Kouzuki Family. After hearing
Kouzuki Toki
's
prophesied
the downfall of

After receiving the message for the up-coming
Onigashima
raid, Kojuro wished to participate in the event, to which Dotaku remarked that they had no weapons and nowhere to hone their skills, since Shogun
Kurozumi Orochi
had closed all the dojos. Kojuro replied that he did not care and was ready to fight with his bare hands.
Later, due to the fact that he has a reverse crescent moon tattoo on his ankle, Kojuro was arrested and sent to the Rasetsu Town prison.
Kojuro tried to convince
Fukurokuju
that the tattoo was just an old symbol and had nothing to do with a rebellion.
Alongwith the other prisoners, Kojuro watched the execution of
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, and cried when he saw Yasuie's edited flyer with the new meeting place.
Weeks later, Kojuro asked one of the guards if they could be released to celebrate the
Fire Festival
, but the gaurd refused, which frustrated Kojuro because he wanted to join in the raid.
On the day of the Fire Festival, Kojuro and the other rebels were freed from Rasetsu Town by
Denjiro
, adding 1,000 soldiers to the raid's forces. The group sailed to
Tokage Port
to retrieve the Scabbards and commence the raid.
Kojuro joined the resistance and traveled with the Kouzuki Family's other allies to
Onigashima
, donning a
disguise
upon arrival.
Kojuro became part of Denjiro's group and headed towards the
Skull Dome
on the south side.
After Denjiro tricked
Sasaki
, the samurais shackled Sasaki to the Sacred Tree, after which the group split and infiltrated the Skull Dome through two entrances.
After the
Nine Red Scabbards
attacked
Kaidou
and fell off the stage with him, Kojuro,
Hyougoro
,
Yatappe
, and other samurai threw off their disguises and defended the Scabbards from the Beast Pirates' interference.
During
Big Mom
's attack on
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Ukon
asked in shock who she was, to which Kojuro replied that she was a female pirate as powerful as Kaidou.
Kakunoshin and Kojuro ask Luffy to move on.
Kojuro and the other samurai Kaidou's and Orochi's forces. When two
Numbers
arrived, Kojuro promised that the samurai would cut a path through them so that the
Straw Hat Pirates
could save their strength. However, the samurai could not stop
Goki
and instead were saved by the Straw Hats.
Kojuro was later infected with the
Ice Oni
virus, which severely infected his body despite
Marco
's
fire
. He said that his strength was running out, and Dotaku asked him to hold out a little longer, citing
Tony Tony Chopper
as an example, who was also infected, but at the same time was preparing an antidote.
After a short period of time, Chopper managed to produce an antidote and
dispered it
to all the infected, healing them.
