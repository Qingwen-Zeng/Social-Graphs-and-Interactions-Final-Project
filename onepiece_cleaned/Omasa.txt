After
Monkey D. Luffy
led a rebellion in the prison, Omasa was freed with the rest of the prisoners. The yakuza bosses later approached
Hyougoro
to show him respect, and upon seeing Luffy's casual way of addressing Hyougoro, they tried to punish Luffy, only to be stopped by Hyougoro. The bosses then let Luffy go and left to recruit their followers from across Wano.
Two days before the
raid on Onigashima
, Omasa and the other yakuza bosses contacted
Kin'emon
and informed him of the number of allies they had recruited.
The rebels gathered at Habu Port and on the day of the
Fire Festival
, they joined the
Nine Red Scabbards
at Tokage Port on a fleet of ships.
After the alliance infiltrated Onigashima, the rebels
received Beasts Pirates disguises
from Kin'emon. Omasa then joined
Denjiro
in the southern forces.
Later, as the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
waged war in Kaidou's stronghold, Omasa struck down some Beasts Pirates.
After he was infected with the
Ice Oni
plague unleashed by
Queen
, Omasa was about to kill himself, but Hyougoro stopped him.
Omasa later completely transformed into an Ice Oni before
Zoro
acquired the antidote from
Apoo
.
When
Marco
used
his flames
, Omasa regained his senses. While
Chopper
worked on mass-producing the antidote, the yakuza leaders and
X Drake
guarded him.
As Omasa was succumbing to the Ice Oni virus again, he requested
Tsunagoro
to end his life. However, Chopper managed to successfully mass-produce the
antidote
and cure all the infected, including Omasa.
