One day Galaxy along with other automata and Dr. Tsukimi were watching the moon and eating snacks
when suddenly a huge explosion happened on the moon.
The explosion was of unknown origin. Professor Tsukimi, shocked, swallowed his dumpling without chewing, resulting in him suffocating to death.
After burying the professor, the four automata along with Galaxy traveled to the moon (each one with a balloon)
to take revenge on the one who caused the explosion that resulted in the accidental death of their creator.
Upon reaching the moon, they find the same
Space Pirates
that destroyed Maxim,
and despite overwhelming odds, they fought the captain of the Space Pirates. In the end, however, Galaxy, along with three other automata, were defeated.
When Spacey tries to thank Enel for defeating the Space Pirates, Enel strikes the automata with lightning.
After Enel recharges the lunar city, the automata thank him for reviving them.
They then join his army.
