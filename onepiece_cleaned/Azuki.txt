Wano Country Arc

After
Bingo
,
Bongo
and
Bungo
ended up in Ebisu Town, Azuki explained their history to
Nami
and
Usopp
. Later she told them about
Yasuie
and his daughter
Toko
.
When Yasuie was sentenced to execution, Azuki and other Ebisu Town citizens rushed to the
Flower Capital
to save him. However, they arrived too late and had to witness Yasuie being shot to death. Due to their
SMILE
side effects, they were unable to mourn his death openly and instead burst into laughter.
Azuki and the other citizens later entrusted Yasuie's body to
Kanjuro
for a proper burial.
On the night of the
Fire Festival
, Azuki celebrated and enjoyed the fresh water.
Later that night, the residents of Ebisu Town watched the broadcast of
Kouzuki Momonosuke
's speech.
A week later, the residents of Ebisu Town continued celebrating the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's victory and enjoying the fresh food and water distributed under
Shogun
Momonosuke's rule.
