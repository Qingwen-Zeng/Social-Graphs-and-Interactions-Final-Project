.
Appearance
[
]
Mr. 11's face close-up.
Mr. 11 was a short man, with long wavy gray hair. He had tattoos of his number on each side of his face, and a large black top hat. He wore a dark blue coat with a gray collar and yellow buttons. Underneath, he sported a purple puffy shirt and black pants.
Personality
[
]
Mr. 11 was quite easily tricked and unable to hold a poker face, inadvertently giving away his connection to
Baroque Works
when
Smoker
pretended to have found a letter with orders in his pocket.
He also mistook a group of
Billions
for
Millions
, showing he did not know much about the lower members of his organization.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Mr. 11 was not seen fighting, but, as a
Frontier Agent
, he must be somewhat proficient in fighting and bounty hunting.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Since Mr. 11 had a sword, it is likely he was decent swordfighter, though not on par with Tashigi.
Weapons
[
]
At some point, Mr. 11 somehow came into the possession of
Kashu
, which was one of the
Meito
, but lost it in his duel with Tashigi.

Captain
Smoker

Mr. Mellow prepares to shoot Mr. 11
While docked at
Nanohana
, the
Marines
went ashore in pursuit of
Monkey D. Luffy
and left Mr. 11 tied up on the ship alone. He attempted to free himself, when a trio of Billions agents boarded the ship. Mistaking them for Millions, Mr. 11 ordered them to untie him. The Billions then revealed their rank and were hence the same level as him. Mr. 11 then apologized, but
Mr. Mellow
instead shot him, intending to take his position in the organization.
Tashigi
later confirmed Mr. 11's death.
