He wears a black hat with an embalmed goat on it and a robe similar to the ones worn by the other cultists, but over his hood he sports a hat shaped like a ram. He has a red, thin sash tied around his waist, with the knot on the front, and he wears a necklace made of light-green beads and what look like some animal's fangs.
