While
Charlotte Linlin
was heading to meet the
Vinsmoke Family
, Anana came up to her, saying that the head chef would not give her knives to mutilate her stuffed animal. Linlin told her sons, Dolce and Dragée, to get the knives for her. The two boys objected, saying that Anana would pop their balloons.
The next day, Dolce and Dragée were on the third floor of the Whole Cake Chateau during
Pudding
and
Sanji
's wedding. When the
Tamatebako
exploded and caused the Chateau to topple, Dolce and Dragée were seen floating around while everyone else was panicking.
