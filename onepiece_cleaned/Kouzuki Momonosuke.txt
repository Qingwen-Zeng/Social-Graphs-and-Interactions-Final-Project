Chapter 1051
.
Kouzuki Momonosuke
is the current
shogun
of
Wano Country
.
A member of the
Kouzuki Family
, he is the son of the late
daimyo
of
Kuri
Kouzuki Oden
and his wife
Toki
, the grandson of the former shogun
Sukiyaki
, and the older brother of
Hiyori
.
Momonosuke was born 28 years ago while his parents were sailing with the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
Though Momonosuke was rightfully the heir to the shogunate after Oden, the
Kouzuki Family
was deposed by the
Kurozumi Family
during Oden's travels, and attempts were made on Momonosuke's life by
Kurozumi Orochi
's administration.
Oden was executed when Momonosuke was 8, and Orochi and
Kaidou
began waging open warfare to eliminate the Kouzuki bloodline. To keep Momonosuke safe, Toki sent him 20 years
forward in time
with several of his retainers.
Upon reappearing, Momonosuke and his men went out to sea to recruit allies for a planned battle against Orochi and Kaidou. To conceal his identity, Momonosuke pretended to be the son of his retainer
Kin'emon
. Throughout their voyage, return to Wano, and climactic battle with Kaidou's forces, Momonosuke steadily grew to accept and assume his role as the leader of the Kouzuki Family and their allies.
To be of better use during the conflict, Momonosuke had his retainer
Shinobu
use her
Juku Juku ability
to age his body 20 years, though he remains a child mentally.
The
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
emerged victorious from this war, and Momonosuke attained his rightful position of shogun to unanimous support from the Wano citizens; he would go on to be renowned as one of Wano's greatest leaders.
He was first mentioned when Kin'emon told
Sanji
that he came to
Punk Hazard
to rescue his "son".
His given name was revealed when the samurai was asking if the captive children in the Biscuits Room had seen him,
and his clan name was revealed when Kin'emon spoke of his true heritage.
He is a major ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the entirety of the
Dressrosa
and
Wano Country Sagas
.
Appearance
[
]
Momonosuke heavily resembles his father Oden (something that
Shinobu
noted), having a similar facial structure as well as the same long and wild mane of black hair (including on the top of his head which was shaven as an 8-year-old). Unlike Oden, Momonosuke's hair is not styled on the top of his head, being unkempt everywhere, and he currently lacks any facial hair. He is quite tall, with Shinobu and his sister Hiyori (who stand at 180 and 170 cm respectively) reaching up to around his chest level. He wears a light, peach-colored kimono with the Kouzuki Family crest on it colored red, and with a flame and cloud pattern on the bottom of the kimono, as well as a dark cloak lined with crescent moon designs, which is also a Kouzuki symbol, and now carries his father's sword,
Ame no Habakiri
as well.
In his prior appearance as an 8-year-old, Momonosuke matched the stereotype of samurai found in ancient Japan, with a topknot and the top of his head shaven. While his unshaven hair was black like his
father
's, the portions of his hair that were shaven were turquoise like his
mother
's and
sister
's. Due to being a child, Momonosuke was quite short. His typical garb was a pink kimono with peach designs on it, matching his name ("momo" means "peach" in Japanese), as well as a pair of geta.
During the
Punk Hazard Arc
, Momonosuke wore a red scarf and a purple obi.
Personality
[
]
Due to his upbringing as a samurai, Momonosuke has a prideful and stubborn personality, as he was unwilling to communicate with the other kidnapped children. He also refused to eat any of the
food
or candy they offered him. Ironically, this attitude is what prevented him from getting
poisoned
by
NHC10
.
Despite his pride, he also cried when he thought Kin'emon had died.
Despite his tender age, Momonosuke is extremely dedicated to the samurai code of Bushido such as benevolence, courage, righteousness, and honor. Having immense compassion, Momonosuke cares dearly for the people of Wano and his retainers as well as other strangers. After learning of Caesar's evil intentions to sacrifice his test subjects, he wanted to warn his fellow captive children about it despite the dangers as he stated it will be shame as a samurai to simply run away. Momonosuke also aided the Straw Hats in treating the brutalized mink citizens of Zou. Momonosuke has great courage and selflessness. When Kanjuro ruthlessly attacked the Kouzuki samurais, Momonosuke tearfully pleaded Kanjuro to stop. When he was abducted by Kanjuro, Momonosuke pleaded all of the Kouzuki allies to continue their raid instead of rescuing him, telling them to prioritize saving Wano Country from Kaidou and Orochi's tyranny over his own safety despite the imminent danger.
Momonosuke is proud of his family as he claims that he is the man who will become the Shogun of
Wano Country
.
He also claims that he is not afraid of anything and even threw a fit when Luffy asked him if he is afraid of heights. However, he is terrified of Doflamingo after having witnessed his cruelty. Despite his pride and stubbornness, Momonosuke did not deny his fear of him. Momonosuke gained his
acrophobia
after being traumatized by Kaidou, who had held him by the throat, threatening to kill him by throwing him off the top of the Kuri Castle. Before that, he was completely fine with heights, having even traveled to and descended from
Skypiea
. He was able to overcome his acrophobia after biting Kaidou, the original source of his fear.
Momonosuke loves his parents dearly and bears immense hatred and resentment towards Kaidou for murdering them. Momonosuke was also utterly frustrated at his powerlessness for not being able to avenge his parents or protecting his retainers. His immaturity and emotional outbursts initially prevented him from assuming authority, but after being spurred on by Luffy, Momonosuke has begun learning to take charge and fulfill his role as the Kouzuki Family's leader.
Momonosuke is also very sharp for his age as despite desiring to reunite with his sister, he understands the danger of Orochi learning of her whereabouts and thus opted to search for Hiyori after Orochi's defeat.
Despite his pride, Momonosuke also has a humble and modest side as he willingly acknowledged his lack of strength and abilities to avenge his parents. Thus, Momonosuke became dedicated to trained relentlessly in order to be strong and overcome his weakness. He is also deeply impressed with Luffy for being able to convince the Udon prisoners to rise up and fight the Beast Pirates oppression, noted that he could never do the same, though was greatly enraged when Luffy agreed with harsh insults. When the Udon Prisoners bowed before him being elated for his safety, Momonosuke had already realized it was because they saw his father's image in him rather himself as a person. Having long realized his weakness and inferiority to his father Oden, Momonosuke also refused to accept his father's heirloom Ame no Habakiri due to believing he is still not capable enough to inherit it and thus asked Hitetsu to continue to hold on to it.
Momonosuke revealing his perverted side.
Despite his age, he seems quite interested in older women such as Robin and Nami and has used a combination of fake innocence and flattery to get the women to treat him maternally, allowing him to get away with things for which grown men would be considered perverted. While it initially appears he really is just innocent, the look that he gives Kin'emon, Brook, and Sanji makes it clear that he knows what he is doing, clearly showing an extremely perverted nature on his part.
His perverted nature is a trait that he inherited from his father who had influenced him while he was a toddler.
Since acquiring his Devil Fruit powers, he has a peculiar habit of transforming into his Beast form whenever he is afraid, such as when Doflamingo was approaching the Thousand Sunny or being presented his father's sword
Ame no Habakiri
.
Relationships
[
]
Family and Retainers
[
]
Parents
[
]
Oden and a two-year old Momonosuke.
Momonosuke loves his parents and could barely speak of their deaths by
Kaidou
and the
Shogun
of
Wano Country
. He is extremely respectful of his
father
both as a samurai and the benevolent daimyo of Kuri to the point where he stopped the fight between
Nekomamushi
and
Inuarashi
in the name of his happiness. Momonosuke also held a strong inferiority complex towards Oden as he admitted he lacked any of his father's strength and courage as he is only living as a shadow of his father, when Kanjuro mocked him. Oden also loved his son as he would encourage Momonosuke to travel overseas to learn more about the world as he had, and upon his death, bequeathed to Momonosuke one of his favorite swords, the Ame no Habakiri. After their deaths, Momonosuke formed an alliance with the
Straw Hat Pirates
and
Heart Pirates
in order to avenge them. When threatened with death by Kaidou, Momonosuke refused to lie about his heritage, and proudly proclaimed himself as his father's successor as the future Shogun of Wano. As he was about to die by Kaidou's hand, he cried partially elated he can reunite with his parents in the afterlife.
Kouzuki Hiyori
[
]
Momonosuke and Hiyori "playing".
As siblings, Momonosuke cares deeply for his younger sister. While Momonosuke suspects that his sister is alive, he said he could not meet her until after Orochi is overthrown or
Hiyori
could become a target. He was greatly relieved to hear from Zoro and Kawamatsu that his sister is still alive.
Momonosuke also respected Hiyori's decision to relinquish one of their father's swords, Enma, to Zoro. When he was about to be executed by Kaidou, Momonosuke's only regret was not being able reunite with his sister. After Momonosuke became the new shogun of Wano, he reunited with his sister, who tearfully embraced him.
Despite this, Hiyori still has some of her childish personality, as she still preferred to dropkick Momonosuke as a way of teasing him, causing Momonosuke telling Hiyori to stop being such a tomboy.
Kin'emon
[
]
As one of the retainers of the
Kouzuki Family
,
Kin'emon
swore to protect Momonosuke with his life and pretended to be his father on their journey for the sake of his safety. When Momonosuke was taken by Caesar, he went after him, and even fought
one
of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
in order to save him. Despite his samurai honor, after Kin'emon confirmed that the meal
Sanji
made on
Punk Hazard
was fine, he listened and joined the feast. Upon his arrival to
Zou
, the first thing Kin'emon wanted to do was to make sure that Momonosuke arrived there safely. When his true identity was revealed, Kin'emon was shown to carry Momonosuke several times, and even lift him in order to complete his alliance with
Luffy
, Law, and the
Mink Tribe
. Despite the father-son ruse, the two do genuinely care for each other almost like family and share an unshakeable bond of trust. Momonosuke even cried heavily when he thought Kin'emon had been killed by the Shinokuni poison gas. Momonosuke also likes to flaunt his success with women in front of Kin'emon and others, which causes his retainer to become bitter and jealous to the point of even speaking ill of his young lord.
Despite the two not being related, the Straw Hats noted that they look alike and share the same perverted traits.
Raizo
[
]
As retainers of the Kouzuki Family,
Raizo
swore to protect Momonosuke with his life. Momonosuke demanded to see Raizo despite the hard climb of the Whale Tree.
Inuarashi and Nekomamushi
[
]
As retainers of the Kouzuki Family, they swore to protect Momonosuke with their life. Despite their mutual antagonistic behavior, when Momonosuke told them to stop fighting, they immediately stop and went back to being friends, worked together, and reminisce about their past.
Ashura Doji
[
]
Ashura Doji
followed Momonosuke's father Oden due to the enormous respect he had for the man. Originally, Ashura's loyalty extended to the rest of the Kozuki Family. However, ten years after waiting for Momonosuke to resurface, many of Ashura's comrades grew impatient and attacked Kaidou only to perish. This led Ashura to become very bitter for the family's absence, and he severed ties with them. As such, he turned down the rallying of a revolution against Orochi and Kaidou, and even refused to address Momonosuke with any honorifics, putting a facade of being loyal solely to Oden. After Yasuie's death, Ashura came about and rejoined the Nine Red Scabbards, aiding Momonosuke.
Friends
[
]
Ginko
[
]
Ginko
was one of the children that was experimented on by
Caesar Clown
, and a fellow captive on Punk Hazard. She was the first person to talk to Momonosuke after he was taken by Caesar Clown's men and tried to convince him to eat something. She witnessed him eating
Vegapunk
's
Artificial Devil Fruit
and transforming into a dragon and showed concern for his whereabouts afterwards.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Momonosuke has grown quite close to the
Straw Hat crew
during his journey with them not unlike
Nefertari Vivi
before him. By the
Zou Arc
, he grew to trust them with his life and by the end of
Raid on Onigashima
, he considers the pirate crew as his closest friends and is immeasurably grateful for helping him save his country. When it came time for the Straw Hats to leave Wano Momonosuke tearfully begged them to stay but he knew they had to go out to sea. Before they left, they made a copy of their
Jolly Roger
to hang in Wano and told Momonosuke to point to it to let people know that Wano was allied with and under the protection of the Straw Hats.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
When they first met in the garbage storage room of
Caesar Clown
's lab, the two began talking and tried to figure how to get out. Upon their arrival at the surface, Momonosuke was exhausted and
Luffy
carried him until he met Caesar and began their fight. Momonosuke was amazed by Luffy's strength after the latter defeated the mad scientist. When the Straw Hats and their companions arrived at Dressrosa, Luffy tried to convince Momonosuke to fly as a way to go around the island. However, this idea angered Momonosuke and the two began to fight with Luffy calling him weak and a crybaby. After
Donquixote Doflamingo
's attack on the
Thousand Sunny
, Luffy learned that Momonosuke was a target and ordered the crew to flee Dressrosa in order to protect him. On Zou, upon the revelation of Momonosuke's true identity, Luffy showed no regard for Momonosuke's title, and another fight broke out. After the revelation of the fate of Momonosuke's parents, it was Luffy's words that cause him to act as the leader he claimed to be and to declare his wish of vengeance. Luffy was also the one to recognize Momonosuke's ability to communicate with
Zunesha
. At the Prisoner Mines in
Udon
, Momonosuke was amazed of Luffy after seeing his ordeal, but Luffy only made Momonosuke angry by saying negative comments about him.
During the raid it was Luffy that help Momonosuke find his courage; first by helping to conquer his fear of heights as they flew back to a floating
Onigashima
and then by encouraging Momonosuke to bite Kaidou.  Despite all their differences Momonosuke admits he still considers Luffy a good friend as shown during his broadcast to Wano. Momonosuke is eternally grateful to Luffy for avenging his mother and father's deaths by defeating Kaidou and freeing his people from the Beast Pirates' oppression. Before leaving Wano, Luffy told Momonosuke he considers him like a little brother (even though Momonosuke is now technically older than him) and that he was welcome to join his crew if he ever decides to become a pirate.
Nami and Robin
[
]
Due to his perverted personality, Momonosuke immediately connected with the women of the Straw Hat Pirates. During their journey to Dressrosa, he slept in their bed and bathed with them, much to the rage of
Kin'emon
,
Sanji
, and
Brook
.
Sanji and Brook
[
]
Sanji and Brook welcome Momonosuke to adulthood.
Due to his connection with the older women of the Straw Hat Pirates, Momonosuke woke the jealousy of Kin'emon, Sanji and Brook much to their collective, perverted anger. Despite of it, they still fought to keep him safe from the
Donquixote Pirates
and later the
Beasts Pirates
. At Onigashima, Sanji rescued Momonosuke from his execution and he was impressed at how Momonosuke declared his heritage instead of lying to save himself. However, after Momonosuke became an adult, both of them were happy that the special privileges he once had with the Straw Hat women are now gone after Nami punched him.
Tony Tony Chopper
[
]
While protecting the Thousand Sunny,
Chopper
did his best to keep Momonosuke happy. He agreed to be the food taster in Momonosuke's game and coerced Brook into playing along as well.
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
Due to their affinity for bushido, Momonosuke has mutual respect for Zoro and was deeply grateful to him for saving his sister. Zoro also gave Momonosuke some advice in training his swordsmanship including the old Kuri dialect Sunachi. Momonosuke also admires Zoro's strength and skills as a swordsman as he did not object to his sister's decision to give one of Oden's swords, Enma, to Zoro.
Yamato
[
]
Yamato showing Momonosuke extreme enthusiasm.
Momonosuke would first meet Yamato during the Raid on Onigashima, being initially introduced to him with his own statement of being Kouzuki Oden, which led to Momonosuke being afraid of him and not taking his efforts serious. However, Yamato was tasked with protecting Momonosuke by Luffy, which Momonosuke heard, and he would later take much effort and damage protecting both him and Shinobu when they were spotted by Sasaki and the Armored Division. Yamato threw himself between both parties, rebuking their attacks while taking all the damage, and even successfully escaped with Momonosuke after Franky unwillingly brought Hatcha to their fight. As he was carrying Momonosuke while they were running to look for a safe place, he told the latter that he must not die in this battle as he will be Shogun of Wano and it would be his task of protecting him no matter what, due to him impersonating Oden.
When they were later hiding in the Forbidden Storeroom, Yamato opened up about his past, sharing his past and dream to both him and Shinobu and after they defended themselves from some Beast Pirates, they were able to take shelter in a roof attic, where Yamato handed Momonosuke Oden's Logbook, which he was certain was his right to possess as Oden's child.
Yamato affectionately teasing Momonosuke.
When the battle would later intensify, Yamato decided to face Kaidou, effectively saving Momonosuke and Shinobu who were cornered by Kaidou on the roof, and when Momonosuke later reappeared as an aged dragon, Yamato was delighted to see Momo again, although confused why he aged so rapidly. When they both decided to leave Kaidou to Luffy, they instead focused on stopping Onigashima from reaching the Flower Capital. In the following arguments, Yamato was not shy from berating Momonosuke and even friendly bashed Momonosuke's head with his Kanabo, only to remind him that they both were focusing on saving lives below. When Momonosuke was faced with the tough decision to use his Devil Fruit Powers to stop the island and as his self-confidence was waning due to him not having mastered nor used his powers properly, Yamato was encouraging Momonosuke to use his powers, explaining the background of dragons while telling him to try and create clouds although he also stated that his clouds must be even stronger clouds than Kaidou, about what Momonosuke was even less confident about. When Momonosuke finally was able to achieve it, Yamato left him to the task, although he was confident, he could stop the island's advancement.
Enemies
[
]
Caesar Clown
[
]
While on Punk Hazard, Momonosuke was able to get away from the guards into a secret room where he heard of Caesar's plans for the kidnapped kids.
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
The
captain
of the
Donquixote Pirates
and an ally of
Kaidou
,
Doflamingo
tried to capture Momonosuke but failed due to Trafalgar Law's interference. At some point in the past, Momonosuke witnessed Doflamingo's brutality, with the event leaving him traumatized. Momonosuke also did not hesitate to admit his fear of the pirate. He was also worried when Doflamingo nearly killed Sanji until the latter was saved by Law.
Giolla
[
]
Giolla
, an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, attacked the Thousand Sunny and tried to capture Momonosuke. With the help of
Nami
, Chopper, and Brook, Momonosuke was saved from Giolla's
power
.
Kaidou
[
]
Momonosuke bites Kaidou after conquering his fear.
Because of
Kaidou
's role in the execution of his
father
, Momonosuke vowed to exact his revenge upon him with Luffy's assistance. Kaidou had threatened to kill him personally, but upon finding Momonosuke to be an immature weakling compared to Oden, he opted to simply leave Momonosuke to die in the burning Kuri Castle.
When Kaidou first saw Momonosuke again after twenty years, he remained unimpressed upon seeing him after being brutally beaten by Kanjuro, and considered him a pathetic weakling compared to Oden. He also questioned Momonosuke whether he is truly Oden's son, as he did not inherit any of Oden's strength, which he thought highly of. Repeating the question he asked twenty years ago, Kaidou offered to spare Momonosuke if he denied about his heritage. When Momonosuke refused to lie, Kaidou prepared to execute him as a Kouzuki in order to officially start his New Onigashima Project. When confronting Kaidou, Momo faced his fear as he attacked Kaidou by biting him while he was in his dragon form.
Kurozumi Orochi
[
]
For being in alliance with Kaidou and participating in the execution of
his father
,
Kurozumi Orochi
earned Momonosuke's hatred and anger. As one of the two last Kouzuki heirs, Orochi himself deemed Momonosuke as a major threat to his rule due to knowing full well that Momonosuke had immense influence over the Kouzuki allies that remain hidden in Wano. Orochi also intended to use Momonosuke as a hostage to stop the incoming Kouzuki revolution.
When Kanjuro brought the child to him, Orochi taunted him for being helpless. Orochi held him on display to the Beasts Pirates and remarked on his survival before stating his plans to execute him. However, he never got the chance because Kaidou killed Orochi, as Momonosuke was solemn about this sight.
Jack
[
]
During
Jack
's second attack on Zou, Zunesha asked for permission to attack his fleet. Momonosuke, being the only one able to communicate with the elephant, ordered him to push Jack back.
Kurozumi Kanjuro
[
]
Kurozumi Kanjuro
infiltrated the Kouzuki Family per Orochi's orders in order to gather information on them, so as to eliminate the Kouzuki bloodline and allow the Kurozumi to rise in power. Kanjuro played his role perfectly, having sworn to serve Momonosuke with his life during the charade.
Momonosuke was shown to worry about Kanjuro on
Dressrosa
.
However, once Orochi gave the order to end the act and bring Momonosuke to Onigashima, Kanjuro took the young Kouzuki captive while the remainder of the Nine Red Scabbards were lured out into the seas.
After revealing his true nature, Kanjuro became merciless to the boy, going as far as to beat him unconscious for trying to escape. When delivering him to Orochi and Kaidou, Kanjuro insults Momonosuke by calling him a brat.
Other
[
]
Zunesha
[
]
With the ability to hear the voice of all things, Momonosuke was able to hear
Zunesha
's cry for help during Jack's attack. They share a special connection, which enabled Momonosuke to share Zunesha's sight and to have the ability to make the elephant hear him as well. Under Momonosuke's order, Zunesha defeated Jack and his fleet instantly.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the heir of the Kouzuki Family, Momonosuke has authority over its retainers, the
Nine Red Scabbards
. Due to this, he is one of the main leaders of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
, which would not have formed without him requesting Luffy and Law's assistance as their equal.
As two of his retainers are the Mink Kings
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
, Momonosuke also has sway over the
Mink Tribe
, a race of powerful warriors who are very loyal to his clan to the point that they would die for any member or retainer.
As the leader of the Wano recruits of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, Momonosuke technically holds authority over said recruits. It was also mainly thanks to his presence that the majority of the Wano recruits from Udon joined the alliance in the first place. However, being still young, he barely uses said authority, entrusting most of it to his loyal retainer Kin'emon.
As the current shogun, Momonosuke has complete control over Wano Country. He restored Wano Country back to its former glory by demolishing all of the toxic factories and the wells for good water as well ceasing
slavery
for good.
Voice of All Things
[
]
Like his father before him, Momonosuke has the ability to hear the
Voice of All Things
,
He was able to communicate with the giant elephant
Zunesha
as well as see through its eyes and give it orders, which is the only way it can do anything but walk. Should Momonosuke order it to attack, he is in command of a powerful weapon capable of wiping out entire fleets in a single blow.
He also has a sort of telepathic link with
Luffy
, as when the pirate was drowning in the ocean after getting beaten by Kaidou, he reassured Momonosuke that he will come back and defeat the emperor no matter what.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Although he has shown none of the inhuman strength his father had as a child, Momonosuke did manage to survive taking a brutal beating from
Kanjuro
; this surprised the samurai, who attributed it to Momonosuke having Oden's blood.
This was shown further after Momonosuke was turned into an adult; he felt no pain after being struck by Hiyori and Nami, and appears to have inherited his father's toughness.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Momonosuke had learned basic swordsmanship from his father at very young age. Although Momonosuke has been seen in possession of swords, he has not been seen wielding them in an actual fight. Therefore, his level of skill in wielding them is unknown. After their return to Wano, he is seen practicing in his swordsmanship on different occasions,
but he still did not see himself as worthy enough to wield
Ame no Habakiri
. Momonosuke is later seen training and receiving advice from Zoro during the three-day period before the raid on
Onigashima
.
While being tied up by Kanjuro, Momonosuke was able to utilize a knife he found on the ground to cut himself free from his ropes. Although he proceeded to be easily overpowered by the samurai, Momonosuke did manage to cut Kanjuro's palm with the knife during their scuffle.
Devil Fruit
[

Main articles:
Artificial Devil Fruit
and
Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu
Momonosuke's child Beast Form producing Flame Clouds.
Momonosuke ate
Vegapunk
's
man-made
copy of the Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu; created from
Kaidou
's
Lineage Factor
which was altered by the original
Mythical Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
, but was deemed a failure by Vegapunk solely due the incorrect coloration of Momonosuke's Beast Form.
It transformed Momonosuke into a serpentine dragon which allows him to seemingly fly by producing
Flame Clouds
(
焔雲
,
Homuragumo
?
)
that he was able to grab onto and climb up that way.
However, as he has only eaten this fruit recently, he does not seem to have much control over it yet, and in fact, transformed unwillingly into his Beast Form shortly after consuming the fruit. He did not know that he could produce and climb Flame Clouds, as he told Luffy he was stuck in the garbage dump when they met there.
This changed, however, once he was turned into an adult dragon by Shinobu and met Yamato during the Raid on Onigashima, as he would explain the full capacity of his Devil Fruit to him once they were in need of his power. This led to Momonosuke using the Fruit's powers to create and manipulate the clouds in the same way Kaidou did
and utilizing the ability to grab and pull the clouds. He also discovered his ability to grab and pull Flame Clouds produced by Kaidou. He would later master the ability as he grabbed the clouds engulfing Onigashima to stop the island from reaching the Flower Capital.
When he was frightened by a hunger-induced hallucination, he unconsciously used his cloud ability to escape with Luffy clinging to him.
He also did not know he could switch forms until
Luffy
told him. It is also possible, though, that he has no conscious control over his power due to inexperience, as well as being artificial.
He showed the ability to revert back to his Human Form when he reunited with Kin'emon. However, Momonosuke is shown to switch forms from time to time.
When Momonosuke transforms, he does it in a poof of yellow smoke or clouds, with the change being nearly instantaneous, which is unlike other Zoan users, who physically morph into their Beast Forms.
Momonosuke's adult Beast Form.
When Momonosuke was aged into an adult, his dragon transformation was shown to be almost identical to Kaidou's in appearance, save for his size, horns, and skin color.
He likewise gained a massive increase in his strength and durability, as he could easily smash through walls by simply crashing into them and his bite was able to hurt Kaidou's own Beast Form. He gained better control over his ability to produce Flame Clouds, being able to use them to fly at high speed. However, his acrophobia still affects him, making it mentally difficult for him to properly fly, causing him to need to close his eyes so he will not be scared by how high he is. After confronting Kaidou and overcoming his weakness, he is able to fly around without much issue. Doing so to grab ahold of Kaidou's Flame Clouds and attempt to pull back Onigashima away from the Flower Capital.
During the battle against
Ryokugyu
, Momonosuke managed to perform Kaidou's
Bolo Breath
, and succeeded in damaging the
Admiral
's
wooden form
.

Kaidou
and
Big Mom

Shinobu
and
Yamato

Weapons
[
]
Unnamed
Wakizashi
: Before consuming his Devil Fruit, he was wearing a short sword that suited his size, although it is unknown how skilled he is at using it.
Ame no Habakiri
: One of the
21 Great Grade Meito
. Forged by his grandfather,
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
, and inherited from his father,
Kouzuki Oden
, it was one of the two swords to scar
Emperor
,
Kaidou
.
However, he opted to wield his Wakizashi in preparations for the upcoming Onigashima Raid, feeling that he isn't worthy enough to wield it.
Once Shinobu aged Momonosuke and took his position of Shogun, he chose to accept Ame no Habakiri.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Momonosuke was born 28 years ago,
to then-daimyo of the
Kuri
region of
Wano
and patriarch of the
Kouzuki Family
,
Kouzuki Oden
, and his wife,
Kouzuki Toki
, during Oden's second year with the
Whitebeard Pirates
onboard the
Moby Dick
. He spent the first two years of his life sailing with the Whitebeard Pirates.
Around 26 years ago, sometime after
Kouzuki Hiyori
's birth, Oden encountered
Gol D. Roger
and decided to assist him with his final journey. Momonosuke then boarded the
Oro Jackson
with his parents and sister.
Sometime after the
Roger Pirates
' visit to
Fish-Man Island
, Toki became ill. When the crew reached Wano Country, Momonosuke left the crew with his mother and sister and stayed behind at Wano.
After Toki recovered from her illness, she and her children became beloved figures of the Kuri region. Around half a year before Oden finished with his voyage,
Kin'emon
and some of his fellow retainers went to the
Flower Capital
to confront the tyrannical
Shogun
Kurozumi Orochi
. Meanwhile, a group of
Beasts Pirates
attacked Oden Castle. The pirates were driven away by
Kawamatsu
and
Inuarashi
, but Toki was injured while she was protecting Momonosuke. After Oden returned to Wano, the family welcomed him back. At Oden Castle, Oden was informed about Orochi's abuse of power, and
Raizo
was then ordered to take Momonosuke and Hiyori out of the room before Oden was told about the Beasts Pirates' attempted attack on his family.
After Oden failed to kill Orochi, Oden's family still loved him despite him acting like a fool and losing the respect of most of Wano's people for the next five years.
20 years ago, while Oden and the Scabbards fought the Beasts Pirates in the
Udon
region, Momonosuke, Hiyori, and Toki stayed in Oden Castle while they were guarded by
Shimotsuki Yasuie
and his men.
On the day of Oden's execution, Momonosuke asked his mother why his life was in danger. After Toki answered his question, Momonosuke started crying.
Kaidou threatens to kill Momonosuke.
After
Oden was executed
in the Flower Capital, Momonosuke was with his sister and mother inside Oden Castle when it was set ablaze by the Beasts Pirates.
Kaidou
threatened Momonosuke but chose to leave him in the burning castle instead of killing him outright.
When the retainers returned, Toki sent Momonosuke and the retainers
20 years into the future
. After arriving in the future, they went around Wano Country and discovered how much it had changed over the years. However, they discovered allies they could still count on and began forming a plan to take back Wano Country. Momonosuke and his retainers also decided to travel to
Zou
to enlist the aid of the
Mink Tribe
, but when they left Wano Country, they were spotted by the Beasts Pirates.
Momonosuke and the other children sailing to Punk Hazard.
While sailing to Zou, they ended up shipwrecked, in which they got separated from Raizo and drifted ashore to
Dressrosa
. While in the country, Momonosuke witnessed
Donquixote Doflamingo
's brutality as he tortured a gladiator for putting on an unsatisfying show at the colosseum.
The samurai were later pursued by Doflamingo's men. Momonosuke hid himself in a ship and the ship set sail before Kin'emon could reach him.
Momonosuke was taken to
Punk Hazard
where he was placed in the Biscuits Room with the rest of the children. Despite the other children's kindness to him by offering him food and candy, he refused to take "another's charity" and told no one his name.
Momonosuke eating Vegapunk's Artificial Devil Fruit out of hunger.
Sometime after sneaking out of the Biscuits Room, he wandered into
Vegapunk
's former office. There, he saw the scientist's
man-made Devil Fruit
inside of a glass display case. Due to his hunger, he smashed open the case and ate the fruit. Soon after, a
Ginko
found him inside the room and talked to him upon entering. Momonosuke told her that he needed to escape and that he had something he needed to accomplish. He listened to her as she talked until they heard the guards coming. She ran away to hide after telling Momonosuke to do the same.
By the time the guards got there, Momonosuke underwent an unconscious transformation into a
dragon
. After escaping the guards, he saw his reflection and, upon realizing that he was the dragon, screamed in shock and continued to run away. Running past
Caesar Clown
's office, Momonosuke overheard the deranged scientist talking about the newest batch of children and how they were only good for about five years of experiments, after which they would die. He was going to warn the other children, but he thought to wait in the garbage dump where he ended up becoming trapped.

Momonosuke encountering Luffy in the garbage dump.
Momonosuke later encountered
Monkey D. Luffy
after the pirate also fell into the garbage dump.
Despite the pirate appearing to recognize his name, Momonosuke believed that Luffy must have been asking for someone else as they had never met before. He also told Luffy to stop drooling, as he seemed to want to eat him. He then told Luffy that he would rather eat him himself. His stomach growled and he admitted that he had been fasting for ten days.
After Momonosuke told him what was happening on
Punk Hazard
, a visibly angry Luffy asked Momonosuke to grab onto him as he planned on getting out of the garbage dump. He was relieved with what Luffy said and thought that it meant Luffy was not a pirate. However, Momonosuke suddenly had a hallucination involving
Donquixote Doflamingo
and started to fly. Luffy grabbed onto him as he flew upward.
After Luffy was informed of
Caesar Clown
's location, they went to Building R. Momonosuke then watched the confrontation between Luffy and Caesar, and felt angry once he saw the face of the man who condemned his captives to death with his experiments. He later expressed shock at Luffy's monstrous strength after observing his initial assault on the deranged scientist.
Caesar's subordinates then opened the air vents to allow the gas to flow in. After Caesar absorbed his weapon,
Shinokuni
, Luffy requested that Momonosuke look after
Brownbeard
before preparing to launch a devastating
Gear 3
attack. Once Caesar was out of the way, Momonosuke and Luffy then joined up with the other
Straw Hat Pirates
, the kidnapped children, and the
G-5
Marines
. After everyone boarded the rail car in the escape route, Momonosuke expressed sorrow when he saw that
Kin'emon
had been petrified by the poisonous
H2S
gas.
Momonosuke, along with the crew, sees the newspaper.
Sometime after Caesar's downfall, Kin'emon broke out of his shell and returned to his normal state. Momonosuke transformed back into his Human Form and was
given clothes
by Kin'emon after the two embraced each other. The two then ate
Sanji
's food, though Momonosuke was hesitant at first.
Everyone then had a feast together.
Momonosuke and Kin'emon boarded the
Thousand Sunny
with the Straw Hats and
Trafalgar Law
. Momonosuke listened as Law explained Doflamingo's connection to the underworld and the fact that his biggest client is
Kaidou
.
The mention of Kaidou's name shocked Momonosuke, and he subconsciously turned into a dragon again, surprising Kin'emon.
Momonosuke clinging onto Robin's towel.
Later that night, he had a bath with
Nico Robin
due to not having had one in days. As he was carried out by Robin while she was only in a towel and Momonosuke was snuggled in her breast,
Brook
, Sanji, and Kin'emon became enraged at him for using his innocent nature to get flattery from Robin and attempted to gang up on him until
Nami
beat them up for scaring him. He thanked Nami and called her a princess, which caused Nami to be flattered and state how cute Momonosuke is and hug him, allowing him to sleep with her and Robin. Momonosuke was then hugged in Nami's breasts and was seen grinning wickedly at the three, showing that he was doing this on purpose for pleasure.
He slept in the women's bed with Nami's arm over his head as he snored.
The next morning, everyone read in the
newspaper
about Doflamingo's resignation as a
Warlord of the Sea
and the alliance between Luffy and Law, as well as the alliance between
Eustass Kid
,
Scratchmen Apoo
, and
Basil Hawkins
.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
After Law told Doflamingo to pick up Caesar at
Green Bit
, Momonosuke had a meal with Kin'emon and the crew. Momonosuke and the samurai told the crew about how they were shipwrecked and drifted to
Dressrosa
, as well as how Momonosuke was separated from the samurai. The Thousand Sunny then approached Dressrosa.
After disembarking, the group began the next phase of their operation. Luffy thought of using Momonosuke, in his dragon form, to fly. However, Momonosuke refused to do so as he remembered a person reaching for him and asking his name. When Luffy asked him if he is afraid of heights, the two got into a small fight until Kin'emon broke them up. The group then split into three teams and Momonosuke was put into the team to guard the Sunny. Momonosuke then prayed for
Kanjuro
's safety.
Momonosuke, Nami, Brook, and Chopper transformed into art.
Momonosuke later played Shogun with Nami,
Tony Tony Chopper
, and Brook. When Brook started singing a song, they heard strange noises and a voice coming from the men's room.
The voice belonged to
Giolla
of the
Donquixote Pirates
, who had invaded the ship along with several of her subordinates. Using
her Devil Fruit power
, she turned the men's room into abstract art and did the same to Nami, Chopper, Brook, and Momonosuke. Hoping to lure Giolla away from the ship, they escaped, but Giolla transformed the ship into art anyway, rendering it unable to sail.
As Giolla attacked the group, Momonosuke told Brook that they were there for him. Then, when Law called the group, Momonosuke refused to admit that they were in trouble and stated that he was fine.
Giolla later trapped Chopper, Momonosuke, and Nami in a deadly painting that would slowly suffocate them in ten minutes. Brook acted nonchalant, seemingly caring more about the art that was being created than his friends' lives. The skeleton asked Giolla to turn his violin and cane back to normal so that he could add accompaniment to their death. Once Giolla complied, Brook then slashed her using 'Drawing Song Hitoyogiri', defeating her and causing her power to wear off, turning everyone back to normal.
Nami's group incapacitating Giolla.
Afterwards, the entire crew attacked Giolla to ensure she was completely incapacitated, something that left Momonosuke proud of his strength. Nami's group then started discussing about what to do with Giolla and wondered why Law was not handing Caesar back to Doflamingo. Giolla proudly told them the truth behind Doflamingo's status, leaving them shocked. As the Sunny approached Green Bit, Nami's group was horrified to see
fighting fish
attacking the ship. When they saw Doflamingo approaching, they cried in terror but were overjoyed and relieved when Sanji intercepted him.
When Sanji was overwhelmed and immobilized by Doflamingo's
strings
, Nami's group panicked. Doflamingo was about to deal a lethal blow to Sanji, but Law intervened by using
Shambles
and teleported Sanji, Caesar, and himself to the Thousand Sunny. Law then instructed Nami's group to head for
Zou
. Nami's group was reluctant to leave behind the other Straw Hats, but they complied when they realized that the ship was facing threats from both Doflamingo and
Fujitora
. After blocking an attack from Doflamingo, Law informed the Straw Hats about Doflamingo's Devil Fruit powers and instructed them to go to a place without clouds. Law then took Giolla hostage, giving Nami's group enough time to escape using Coup de Burst.
After sailing far away from Dressrosa, Momonosuke recounted the first time he saw Doflamingo which left a terrifying impression on him.
When
Roronoa Zoro
finally made contact with Luffy, the group on the Sunny engaged in a conference call with both Luffy and
Franky
's group. After everyone was brought up to speed and learned about the true situation on Dressrosa, Sanji decided to sail back to Dressrosa to carry out their assault on Doflamingo.
Through the
Den Den Mushi
, the group on the Sunny heard the skirmish occurring at the
Corrida Colosseum
and was shocked to hear that an
Admiral
was also present in Dressrosa. The return trip was cut short by the appearance of the
Big Mom Pirates
, who were after Caesar Clown. Momonosuke was deemed by Nami to be one of the three "cards" at stake, and she suggested to change course once again in order to keep him safe from Doflamingo. Luffy agreed and gave the order for the group on the Sunny to head to Zou.
Momonosuke and the others managed to barely elude the Big Mom Pirates and arrived at Zou the next day. After forcing Caesar to take them to the top of the
giant elephant
, they came across
Sheepshead
chasing after
Tristan
. After saving Tristan and running from Sheepshead, they found Zou's ruined city covered in poison gas and the devastated Mink Tribe.
During the conflict with the Beast Pirates left behind at Zou, Momonosuke, Nami, and Brook ran through unstable terrain when they were suddenly confronted by Sheepshead and his comrades. Right then, a rain eruption from the elephant's trunk occurred, causing them to be swept away by a flood. Momonosuke and Brook had to be saved by Nami due to being Devil Fruit users, and she carried them to a log. Sheepshead attacked the three of them, but Brook blocked him and Momonosuke cheered for Brook. They were then saved when Sanji arrived and kicked Sheepshead away. Later, Momonosuke heard Chopper calling out to them.
After Caesar neutralized the poison gas, Momonosuke's group then got to work on treating the injured
minks
, saving them from certain death.

Momonosuke hides from the Mink Tribe.
While the Straw Hats got along amiably with the minks, Momonosuke remained in his room, avoiding any contact with the minks.
When Kin'emon and Kanjuro finally arrived, Momonosuke reunited with them while they were going to the Mokomo Dukedom. Once they arrived at Kurau City, they were quickly intercepted by the Straw Hats, who tried desperately to keep them hidden. However, when they saw
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
fighting with each other, the samurais revealed themselves, much to the Straw Hats' horror. Contrary to what the Straw Hats expected, the Mink Tribe welcomed them and revealed that
Raizo
is safe as well as having a friendship with Kin'emon's clan.
While conversing with Kin'emon, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi began arguing again. Momonosuke stepped up and begged them to cease their quarreling. Not wanting to disappoint Momonosuke, whom they recognize as their lord, the two rulers complied. Kin'emon then revealed that he is not really Momonosuke's father and that his real father is the lord of the
Kouzuki Family
. After Inuarashi and Nekomamushi called a truce, they took the samurais and the Straw Hats to a secret area in the Whale Forest where Raizo was hidden.
After Robin deciphered the red
poneglyph
that Raizo was tied to, Momonosuke allowed Nekomamushi to reveal the history of the Kouzuki Family and their creation of the poneglyphs. However, Momonosuke's retainers explained that Momonosuke never inherited his family's knowledge of the poneglyphs and they welled up in tears as Kin'emon revealed that
Kouzuki Oden
was executed by
Kaidou
to save them.
Right after the samurais revealed Oden's will to open the
Wano Country
to the world and to defeat Kaidou and the shogun of Wano
Kurozumi Orochi
, Kin'emon asked Luffy to assist them. Luffy declined, saying that Momonosuke should make the request himself. Momonosuke then declared his will to fight Kaidou and protect those dear to him. While prostrating, Momonosuke humbly asked for Luffy's help. Seeing his resolve, Luffy accepted his request, forming the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
.
Zunesha speaks to Momonosuke and Luffy as it comes under attack.
They later left the secret room and the samurai explained that they never went with Oden during his travels as leaving the borders of Wano is a crime. While discussing their plans to defeat Kaidou, the alliance decided to split up and meet up again at Wano Country. Law agreed to take the samurais back to Wano Country in his submarine. Right after they left the Whale Tree, they felt Zou shaking and heard Zunesha crying.
As everything shook around them, Momonosuke saw
Jack
and his fleet through Zunesha's vision. He heard the elephant's voice, which told him to give it an order. Luffy then urged Momonosuke to give a command to Zunesha, saying that his voice should reach the elephant. Hearing this, Momonosuke ordered Zunesha to drive Jack away. After Jack's fleet was sunk, Momonosuke fell asleep.
After Zunesha calmed down, Momonosuke chose to stay on Zou to find out why only he can speak to Zunesha and to see if Zunesha knows anything about the Kouzuki clan. Inuarashi promised to bring Momonosuke back to Wano when the time came. As the Sanji Retrieval Team departed from Zou, everyone, except for the Straw Hat members left behind, were shocked when Luffy jumped off Zunesha with his party.
Wano Country Saga

Wano Country Arc

Momonosuke eventually went to Wano with Inuarashi, and he rejoined Kin'emon's group at the ruins of
Oden Castle
. He later reunited with Luffy, Nami, Sanji, Chopper, and Brook when they came to the ruins.
There, the samurai told the Straw Hats their plan to raid
Onigashima
during the
Fire Festival
and depose Kaidou and Orochi.
The group then saw Kaidou in his
Beast Form
come to Kuri to hunt down Luffy and Law, and Kaidou obliterated the castle ruins with a blast of fire,
but
Shinobu
saved everyone by
sinking them into the ground
.
A short time later, Momonosuke watched as Kin'emon and Inuarashi unsuccessfully tried to recruit Oden's former retainer
Ashura Doji
to their alliance.
Later, Momonosuke was practicing his swordsmanship near Amigasa Village when
Tama
asked him about his sister,
Hiyori
. Momonosuke believed that Hiyori was still alive, but did not intend to reunite with her until the war was over.
Momonosuke, Chopper, Kikunojo, Tama, and Big Mom go to Udon to free the imprisoned Luffy.
That night, Momonosuke, Tama, Chopper, and
Kikunojo
were walking through the forest when they encountered an amnesiac
Charlotte Linlin
on Kuri Beach.
They traveled to
Okobore Town
with Linlin the next morning, and after she had eaten some
oshiruko
, they told her she could find some more in
Udon
, where Luffy was imprisoned.
They traveled to Udon on the back of a
wanizame
, and Momonosuke shouted "
sunacchi
" while practicing his swordsmanship after hearing Zoro tell him about it. Kikunojo told him not to use that word, saying it was unbecoming for someone of his status.
The liberated Kouzuki Family allies bow to Momonosuke.
The group reached Udon the next day, and Linlin broke into the
Prisoner Mine
. Kikunojo and Chopper followed her, telling Momonosuke and Tama to wait outside.
However, when the Beasts Pirates closed the main gate, Tama forced Momonosuke to sneak inside with her.
They reunited with Luffy after he and their comrades successfully liberated the prison, and as Momonosuke bickered with Luffy, he was forced to appear in front of the liberated prisoners. The prisoners bowed before Momonosuke as their confidence in the Kouzuki Family's return was restored.
Momonosuke returned to Amigasa Village with Kikunojo and Raizo in the next week, where the Straw Hats and Kouzuki Family retainers met to discuss their strategy.
There,
Kawamatsu
revealed that Hiyori was still alive, and Momonosuke thanked Zoro for saving her.
Tenguyama Hitetsu
presented Momonosuke with
Ame no Habakiri
, the blade Oden had passed down to him, but Momonosuke declined it for now. He then watched as Zoro received Oden's other blade,
Enma
, and was able to control it. With a day left before the raid, Momonosuke, Shinobu, and the remaining
Red Scabbards
set off for Tokage Port to make preparations.
Kanjuro abducts Momonosuke.
However, when they came to Tokage Port, they found none of their allies there.
The Scabbards prepared to set sail for Onigashima by themselves, and Momonosuke told them to stop, but they said this plan could not be rescheduled and encouraged him to survive while they did their best to repay their debt to Oden.
However, Kanjuro, who was actually a spy for Orochi, had sent a drawing clone of himself onto the boat with the other Scabbards, allowing him to capture Momonosuke by surprise.
After
Denjiro
and the alliance allies arrived, Kanjuro conjured a crane and flew away toward Onigashima with Momonosuke in tow. As Kanjuro mocked the legacy of his parents and his cowardice, Momonosuke ordered the alliance to press forward without worrying about him.
Kanjuro later took Momonosuke to Onigashima but they were lost due to Kanjuro being unfamiliar with Onigashima's complex layout. After Kanjuro struck down some Beasts Pirates since they still thought he was an enemy, Momonosuke spotted a nearby knife.
Later, Momonosuke attempted to escape and cut Kanjuro's hand in the process. In response, Kanjuro brutally beat the boy to the point of unconsciousness.
Momonosuke was eventually delivered to Orochi and Kaidou when Kanjuro finally reached them.
The Scabbards interrupt Momonosuke's execution.
The boy was then tied up on a crucifix and placed on display at the Performance Floor inside the
Skull Dome
.
After Kaidou explained his
New Onigashima Project
and disposed of Orochi,
the
Emperor
asked Momonosuke for his name and offered to spare him if he denied being Oden's son. Momonosuke mustered up his courage and proudly declared his name and heritage. Before Kaidou could execute him, the Scabbards and
Izou
arrived and attacked Kaidou.
After Kaidou and the Scabbards took their fight to the roof of the Skull Dome, Shinobu attempted to free Momonosuke, but
King
noticed her and hurled her away. However, Sanji was able to retrieve Momonosuke using his
Raid Suit
and flew away. While clashing with King in midair, Sanji threw Momonosuke to Shinobu, who then immediately flew off, taking Momonosuke with her.
After landing, Momonosuke and Shinobu encountered Yamato. However, when Yamato identified himself as Oden, Momonosuke and Shinobu ran away from him.
The two were later attacked by
Sasaki
's platoon, but Yamato stepped in to protect them.
Momonosuke questioned who he was, and Yamato reaffirmed his commitment to protect him and reintroduced himself as Yamato.
Franky (while in the
General Franky
) later arrived with
Hatcha
chasing him. While trying to attack Franky, Hatcha created a giant hole in the floor, and Yamato took this opportunity to escape with Momonosuke and Shinobu.
They got out of the Skull Dome, but by that time, Kaidou had already lifted the entire island above sea level.
They then hid out in a storeroom inside the Skull Dome. When Momonosuke asked about the discarded dragon statue in the room, Yamato revealed that
Portgas D. Ace
once came to Onigashima to kill Kaidou.
He then heard about the meeting between Yamato and Ace, and he was shocked to learn that Yamato is Kaidou's son, and that Ace was Luffy's brother and
Gol D. Roger
's son. Yamato then pulled out Oden's journal and declared that Luffy coming to Wano must have been an act of fate as he has the initial
D
.
Momonosuke questioned what he meant. Yamato then gave Oden's journal to Momonosuke, explaining to him what it is, causing him to tear up. Yamato then went on to explain more about his relationship with Ace, as Momonosuke and Shinobu listened.
Later, Yamato caught a mouse
Mary
which Momonosuke had heard broadcasting a message. Yamato explained what the Marys are and stated that their location was compromised. Just then, a group of Beasts Pirates attempted to break into the storeroom. Yamato and Shinobu fought their way out while Momonosuke hid under Yamato's clothes.
In the Right Brain Tower, Yamato and Shinobu continued moving as Yamato asked Momonosuke how he was doing. Momonosuke said that he felt disgusted with himself because everyone thought highly of him, yet he saw himself as weak and foolish. Shinobu denied this and called him brave, but Momonosuke refuted this claim and transformed into a dragon at the same time, which surprised the two.
He managed to return to normal, saying he is much better at controlling it than he used to be, citing that he would transform whenever he was surprised or sad when he first met Luffy's crew. Yamato mentioned how similar his transformation is to Kaidou's and Momonosuke wished he could become a monster like Kaidou so he could be more useful. Yamato mentioned that he wanted to help Luffy fight Kaidou but Momonosuke said that Luffy was weakened yet somehow still fine. Shinobu expressed relief before asking him how he knew that.
The group took refuge in a crawlspace on the first floor and made contact with Kin'emon. Yamato then decided to leave Momonosuke and Shinobu to join the fighting and warned Momonosuke to avoid Marys, stating that he would act as a decoy with a dummy of Momonosuke. Before leaving, Yamato asked Momonosuke how Luffy was doing, and Momonosuke told him that his state was the same as before, but there were only two voices now, which caused Yamato to hurry. Momonosuke then began to read Oden's journal.
While unknowingly being observed by a frog Mary, Momonosuke came to the conclusion through reading Oden's journal that he must not die and tells this to Shinobu. He then suddenly suffered a headache, which caused him to yell out in pain and loudly question whose voice he was hearing, worrying Shinobu.
The voice belonged to Luffy, who told Momonosuke to tell everyone that he is going to defeat Kaidou.
Soon after, Kin'emon and Kikunojo reached the crawlspace and attempted to help Momonosuke. At the same time,
Bao Huang
began broadcasting a message through all of the Marys announcing Luffy's defeat, which came in through the frog Mary. Shinobu noticed this and tried to warn the others that they were being observed, but she was ignored as Momonosuke attempted to tell Kin'emon that they must give everyone Luffy's message. Just then, Kanjuro, who had secretly followed Kin'emon and Kikunojo, came into the crawlspace disguised as Oden. Momonosuke was pleasantly surprised to see who he believed was his father, but Kin'emon covered his eyes as Kikunojo declared that he was an imposter and went to attack Kanjuro. Kanjuro defeated Kikunojo and removed his disguise, and Momonosuke was distressed to see him. After Kin'emon went on to defeat Kanjuro, Kaidou suddenly burst into the crawlspace through the wall, which greatly surprised Momonosuke. Shinobu then grabbed Momonosuke and began to flee as Kin'emon is gravely wounded by Kaidou, causing Momonosuke to cry out his name.
Momonosuke continued to sob as he observed Kin'emon's defeat at the hands of Kaidou. As Shinobu continued to run, Momonosuke revealed that he had grabbed the frog Mary, and Shinobu asked him why he was holding it. He then used the Mary to tearily broadcast Luffy's message to the alliance. He stated his name and encouraged everyone to continue fighting, and then declared that Luffy is alive and going to win. After successfully delivering the message, Shinobu is cornered by Kaidou, who asked Momonosuke if he was satisfied. As Kaidou went in to attack them, Shinobu used her powers to destroy the wall they were up against and jumped off of the side of Onigashima with Momonosuke.
Shinobu used her kite to safely land them on the Wano mainland.
After landing, Momonosuke cried about how high up they had been and called out Kin'emon and Kikunojo's names.
Later, Momonosuke and Shinobu met up with Luffy and the Heart Pirates at Tokage Port. Momonosuke began to cry and started to tell Luffy about what had happened, but Luffy told him to hold it in until after Kaidou was defeated. Luffy then asked Momonosuke to turn into a dragon and fly him back up to Onigashima.
Momonosuke begged Shinobu to use her power to age him into an adult so that he would be stronger and transform into a bigger dragon. Shinobu tried to dissuade Momonosuke by telling him that mentally he would still be a child, and turning him into an adult would be irreversible.
Ultimately, Shinobu gave in to Momonosuke's request and aged him by twenty years, making him a twenty-eight-year-old. He then transformed into his Beast Form, which had become the same size as Kaidou's, and agreed to take Luffy with him back to Onigashima.
Momonosuke carrying Luffy, facing Kaidou for a rematch.
However, Momonosuke hesitated to even lift his head due to his fear of heights, which Luffy scolded him for, starting an argument between the two. Momonosuke eventually managed to take flight, but he refused to open his eyes, which caused him and Luffy to crash into the Skull Dome, flying through several walls and floors and surprising everyone who saw them. When they reached their destination, a still-panicking Momonosuke finally opened his eyes when he heard that Luffy had spotted Kaidou and flew toward the Emperor, allowing Luffy to attack Kaidou simultaneously with Yamato. As Kaidou went into his Beast Form, Momonosuke mustered the courage to reintroduce himself and once again declared himself to be the man who will become the shogun of Wano. Kaidou, who was both surprised and amused to see what happened to the son of Oden, declared that there is no room in this world for two dragons.
However still intimidated by Kaidou's presence, when Kaidou launched an attack, Momonosuke was nearly hit by it, only able to dodge it by swirling his body and letting the attack pass through. Before Luffy would start a second attack on Kaidou, he encouraged Momonosuke to use his fangs as a weapon against Kaidou, with Momonosuke then remembering his past ambush at Oden's castle and his near death by the Kaidou's hand, finally finding the courage to stand up to his name and bite Kaidou. Remembering the humiliation he endured thanks to Kaidou, Momonosuke proceeded to bite Kaidou, intensifying the power of his bite, even after Kaidou angrily shouted at him and would net let go of Kaidou, until Luffy stepped in to hit Kaidou.
After Luffy's and Kaidou's Haki clashed, Luffy asked Yamato to help Momonosuke, so he hopped onto his head. Kaidou tried to attack them, but Yamato blocked the attack and Momonosuke fell off the edge of the island. As they fell together, Yamato explained how dragons fly by creating and grabbing clouds. As Momonosuke practiced the ability, they raced back to island and noticed that it had begun to crumble because Kaidou's powers were fading. Momonosuke attempted to directly push against the island but to no avail. Yamato explained that he would need to create Flame Clouds stronger than Kaidou's in order to change the island's direction. He further explained that the Skull Castle's basement was filled with explosives, which would explode if Kaidou's power were to fail, and the island fell. When Momonosuke suggested stopping Luffy's fight, Yamato angrily hit him and advised that they both should avert this danger themselves.
Momonosuke pulls Onigashima away from the Flower Capital.
Yamato then left Momonosuke so that he could handle the explosives. He initially panicked at being left alone with the task but reminded himself of all the lives at stake.
He focused on amassing the clouds in small bits at a time
and eventually generated enough to wrap around the island's base. He then pulled the island, slowly guiding it toward the ground
since his clouds on their own could not hold the island aloft.
As he was still moving the island, he heard someone call out to him. Later, having not noticed Law's giant sword, Momonosuke was surprised when a large hole appeared on the surface of Wano.
An explosion in the island's underground armory blew out a huge portion of the island behind Momonosuke, and another more massive explosion occurred in the hole on Wano caused by Big Mom falling in with multiple bombs. Afterwards, Yamato explained to him the reasons for the explosions, and he informed Yamato about the approach of Zunesha,
Joy Boy
's companion written about in Oden's journal,
who had come to join the battle. However, due to the page ripped out of Oden's journal and his own misgivings about his abilities, Momonosuke questioned if his father would still want Wano's borders opened.
Suddenly, one of Kaidou's blasts tore through the island, interrupting his discussion with Yamato.
Shortly after, Momonosuke noticed that he could not sense Luffy anymore, and his panic grew when Kaidou announced Luffy's death. Yamato leapt on to Momonosuke's back, and the two argued on whether to continue fighting or to surrender. They agreed to face Kaidou together, but Momonosuke was stopped by Zunesha announcing Joy Boy's return.
Shocked by this news, Momonosuke shared what Zunesha told him with Yamato, shocking him as well.
Momonosuke successfully lands Onigashima away from the Flower Capital.
Momonosuke and Yamato flew back up to the roof and witnessed the antics of Luffy's
awakened Devil Fruit
, which stunned them.
As the Flame Clouds holding Onigashima continued weakening, Yamato renewed the request for Momonosuke to create stronger Flame Clouds.
Momonosuke struggled to make more and, remembering the final moments with his mother, realized that he was failing her. Luffy later made a massive fist and called out for Momonosuke to move the island out of the way of his punch.
Momonosuke pushed against the island, while Luffy's and Kaidou's attacks clashed overhead.
Once Kaidou's Flame Clouds disappeared completely, Momonosuke finally produced a Flame Cloud strong enough to replace Kaidou's. Momonosuke then guided the island down and safely landed it near the Flower Capital. Afterwards, he collapsed from exhaustion.
Momonosuke's dragon appearance accidentally scares the people of the Flower Capital.
He soon recovered, telling Zunesha that he plans on not opening Wano's borders yet and made his way to the Flower Capital in his dragon form, scaring off the citizens in the process. Assuring them he was not Kaidou, as the explosion earlier was Kaidou's sent off, he turned back into his Human Form, with other figures emerging from the smoke, before being introduced to the people of Wano as the new Shogun by Denjiro.
As the reemergence of the Red Scabbards was transmitted through Wano, Momonosuke spoke to the people of Wano, introducing himself as Kouzuki Oden's son, telling them that the iron grip and reign of Kaidou, Orochi and the Beasts Pirates has finally ended before announcing several changes previously not happening like abandoning slavery and abolishing the weapon factories. He then went on to explain that he met a powerful friend on his voyage, forming the alliance alongside him which would ultimately defeat Kaidou and Orochi.
As the crowd cheered over the news, Momonosuke grew nervous about what else to say, mumbling to Kin'emon what else to say. He then pushed through and announced his name, asking for the support of Wano's people in rebuilding Wano together while reassuring himself that he will keep his promise to his parents. He then hugged Hiyori and made his way inside the shogun castle, alongside the Scabbards, Hiyori and Shinobu.
As he was planning another Fire Festival, he would receive message of Luffy and Zoro waking up from their unconsciousness, greeting them while they were recovering. However, due to his altered appearance, they did not immediately recognize him, so Momonosuke tried to find comfort in Nami as he used to when he was a boy, only for Nami to sent him flying as his body is now an adult, while reminded her that he was still a child inside before being teased by Yamato who put a plate on his head. He would later join the other men for a bath and was surprised to see Yamato taking a bath with them.
When Admiral
Ryokugyu
came to Wano to take Luffy's head, Momonosuke joined the fight against him alongside the Red Scabbards and Yamato, explaining he gave an oath to the people of Wano to protect them from every harm no matter the cost, including a Marine Admiral. He tried to bite Ryokugyu's wooden body, but due to his
Devil Fruit
's nature, he was unable to hurt him and Momonosuke was then entangle by Ryokugyu's vines and unable to move his dragon body. When Yamato wanted to save him, Momonosuke told Yamato he must not fight.
Momonosuke then went on to explain that he did not want Yamato to fight Ryokugyu as Momonosuke saw this as a sign of weakness not only of himself, but the people of Wano not being able to defend themselves against whatever enemy came to Wano.
Momonosuke battles Admiral Ryokugyu.
Telling Yamato, he did not want anybody else anymore to fight their fights for him or Wano, Momonosuke began shedding tears as he didn't want to rely on anymore outside people to protect either him or the people of Wano. Momonosuke then suddenly unleashed a
Bolo Breath
from his mouth to the surprise of everyone else present, including him, directly through Ryokugyu's wooden body. This was followed by an immediate second
Bolo Breath
, this time incinerating Ryokugyu's wooden body completely, forcing him to sprout again and turn back into his human form, though he once again transformed back into his wooden form to fight Momonosuke again. Their fight was then unceremoniously ended by
Shanks
from afar Wano, who forced Ryokugyu to retreat, leaving Momonosuke tear-shedded once the fight was over.
After the Fire Festival was over, both he and Hiyori came to meet their grandfather Kouzuki Sukiyaki, who apologized to them but was embraced by them both with tears as their relative, with Momonosuke stating that after the loss of their parents, they were happy to know that they had at least one more blood relative. Several days later, Momonosuke was in the Flower Capital attending to his Shogun duties when he wanted to ask Zoro to teach him some sword techniques. To his surprise, he did not find the Straw Hats and, after asking Hiyori, was informed by her that they left in the morning and was surprised that they did not bid him farewell. When Kine'mon approached him, they both learned from each other that they were left out of the farewell biddings to their surprise, wondering why they were left out, though Momonosuke was still surprised to learn that Yamato was on the roof and did not leave yet.
He then carried both Yamato and Kin'emon towards the port where the Straw Hats were preparing to depart Wano. Along the way, he had a lengthy conversation with Yamato and Kin'emon about Yamato staying, being surprised he decided to stay in Wano, nonetheless. Making his way forward, Momonosuke became angry with the Straw Hats for knowing about this and not telling him and additionally not personally bidding farewell to him. He then looked back at his life when his home was destroyed by Kaidou, the first time he met Luffy, every interaction with Luffy and finally when Luffy declared he would defeat Kaidou. But then both Momonosuke and Kin'emon angrily agreed on punishing Luffy for his apparent rudeness towards them and the lack of friendship. However, all thoughts of anger were given up when Momonosuke reached Tokage Port and, in his human form, tackled Luffy to the ground, tearfully bidding him not to leave Wano, being afraid of what the future might hold for him without Luffy's help.
Momonosuke takes his place as the Shogun of Wano.
He was then surprised when Luffy threw a flag at him with the Straw Hats logo on it, saying he intentionally waited for him to give him the flag, declaring Wano and all its inhabitants under his protection as an Emperor of the Sea. When Momonosuke asked him if he was now a part of the crew, Luffy addressed him, Kin'emon and Yamato, saying whenever they were ready to become pirates he would come and pick them up. When the Straw Hats departed, Momonosuke addressed Kin'emon, saying he would surpass his father one day. When the trio later returned to the Flower Capital, Momonosuke was wondering where to put the flag.
