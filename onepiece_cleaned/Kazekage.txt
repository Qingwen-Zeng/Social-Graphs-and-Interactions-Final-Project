History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
While
O-Robi
was sneaking around
Orochi Castle
, Kazekage and the rest of the Orochi Oniwabanshu silently appeared behind her.
On
Fukurokuju
's orders the group moved to restrain her, with Kazekage throwing shuriken toward her. However, the Oniwabanshu discovered that this Robin was actually a
body double
, and Fukurokuju sent them to the banquet hall to locate the real Robin.
Daikoku
eventually spotted Robin and the Oniwabanshu confronted her, but with
Brook
's assistance Robin began to repel them with her powers, and the intruders managed to escape from the castle.
After
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution, the Orochi Oniwabanshu arrived to help fight off the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Several days later, the
Fire Festival
arrived and the Oniwabanshu accompanied
Kurozumi Orochi
to
Onigashima
to celebrate with the
Beasts Pirates
.
However, during a speech,
Kaidou
killed Orochi and announced his intention to assume control over
Wano Country
. Kaidou gave the Oniwabanshu and
Mimawarigumi
the choice to join him or die. Fukurokuju promptly pledged the Oniwabanshu's allegiance to him, and Kazekage and his comrades were relieved that they would not have to fight the Beasts Pirates.
As the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
waged an all-out-war in
Kaidou's stronghold
, the Oniwabanshu fought against the rebels.
They were surprised to see
Queen
's
Ice Oni
virus had restored
Hyougoro
to his former stature and strength.
The legendary yakuza defeated most of the Oniwabanshu, including Kazekage and Daikoku, as well as the Mimawarigumi.
