Salome is a large white snake with large pink spots running down her body. The underside of her body is pale yellow, with thin horizontal black lines across it.

Personality

For a snake, Salome appears to be a friendly and fun loving snake. She is very close to Hancock and cares about her well-being, as she was shown worried about her condition when she was bedridden from
Love Sickness
. No matter the situation, Salome is always seen smiling. Salome seems to be fond of food, as she was shown eating the food on the
Marine ship
with
Luffy
and even showing enjoyment on her part.

Further information:
Snake Weapon
As an oversized Snake Weapon, Salome usually curls herself into a chair for
Boa Hancock
to sit on, similar to a throne. She also has curled herself as a spiral for supporting her. Because of her size, she can use Salome to gain a height advantage in order to effectively use her Slave Arrow as an aerial bombardment technique.
She also has the ability to track down things on the ocean floor, shown when she was able to sense Whitebeard's seaquake before it arrived, and when she helped Hancock follow
Trafalgar Law
's
submarine
.
Salome is also a very strong swimmer, capable of diving into the ocean and save Luffy in very quick time.
In the non-canon
Pirate Warriors
series, Salome can attack enemies with her body and can transform into a bow which Hancock can use to fire
Slave Arrows
. This technique was named
Prisoner Crossbow
in
Pirate Warriors 4
, where it appears as both a combo attack and Special Move for Hancock.
