When the Roger Pirates defeated a battalion of Marines and spotted the
Whitebeard Pirates
approaching them, Ganryu joined his comrades as the two crews battled each other for four days until the fight settled into a gift exchange.
The crew gained Oden after the confrontation, and they sailed to many destinations including
Skypiea
,
Water 7
,
Fish-Man Island
,
Wano Country
, and
Zou
. During their adventures, Ganryu was seen enjoying a hot spring with his crewmates. On Zou, Ganryu noticed when Oden sensed the Road Poneglyph and suggested that he could go back to the ship if he was not feeling well. The crew made it to the final island and laughed when they saw the treasure left behind by
Joy Boy

After departing from the island, named
Laugh Tale
