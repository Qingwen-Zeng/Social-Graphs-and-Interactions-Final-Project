After he was badly wounded because of
Shutenmaru
's food theft, he was taken care of by
Tsuru
. As Tsuru tended to his injuries, he regretted having lost the food given by
Luffy-tarou
.
Around two weeks later, the Beasts Pirates Headliner
Holed'em
came to Okobore Town to confront the citizens over food from the
Paradise Farm
being stolen in large quantities over the past several days. In order to keep safe the samurai who were rumored to be planning a raid against
Kaidou
, the citizens claimed responsibility for the thefts, leading to the town being burned down and their fates left unknown.
