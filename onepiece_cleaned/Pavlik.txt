Pavlik
is an infamous
New World
pirate captain who was subordinate to
Whitebeard
.
Appearance
[
]
Pavlik is a fat man with short legs and thin arms. He dresses in mafia-style clothing such as a black fedora alongside a white collared shirt with a black tie under black coat.
In the manga, he appears on separate occasions with a slightly different appearance. In his debut, he had a thick gray beard and wore a black pirate captain coat,
but he had shorter facial hair and wore a black coat with a white cape over, in subsequent appearances, much like that of his concept art and the anime.
Personality
[
]
Pavlik is very loyal to
Whitebeard
, as he was willing to risk his and his own crews' lives to save
Portgas D. Ace
. This shows that Pavlik highly treasures friendship because he charged straight into battle upon orders to save their comrade.
Also, his willingness to challenge
Marine Headquarters
shows that he is a fearless pirate that will not back down even in the toughest of situations, which is further showed when he was faced with an army of
Pacifistas
, but still stood his ground and continued to fight.

History

Past
[
]
In the past, Pavlik became a renowned pirate in the New World and allied himself with
Whitebeard
as a subordinate captain.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Marineford Arc
[
]
When
Portgas D. Ace
was to be executed at
Marineford
, Pavlik and his crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
in order to save him from execution. While the
Marines
were bracing for the arrival of the pirates, Pavlik and the allied fleet of the 43 subordinate captains caught them by surprise when the fleet suddenly appeared out of nowhere just off the shores of Marineford.
A few moments later, the pirates received the orders to attack and, immediately following the vice admirals' entrance into battle, Pavlik charged into battle alongside several of the other subordinate captains.
During the battle, Pavlik blew up the head of a
Pacifista
as he fought alongside
Rush
,
Elmy
, and
Arthur
in clearing a path to save Ace.
After
Whitebeard
and Ace's death, Pavlik watched in horror alongside
Ninth
and
Happygun
as they witnessed
Sakazuki
piercing straight through
Jinbe
and hitting
Luffy
.
At the end of the war, the
Red Hair Pirates
arrived and Sengoku allowed the surviving pirates to leave.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The scene where the allied captains charged into battle is omitted in the anime. However, the anime does at a scene in which Pavlik is seen commenting to a fellow pirate about how they still have to deal with the Pacifistas.
In the manga, he was only seen fighting against the Pacifista with other captains.
Because of the omission of his manga debut scene, Pavlik is only seen in the anime with his second design, and not the initial one shown in the manga.
