Past
[

In many instances in Sabo's life, Didit tried to guide and teach him by ways of nobility. She told him that he should marry a royal princess so the family could live easier and be happier. When Sabo was assaulted by an armed royal boy, Didit was much more concerned by the wellbeing of the royal child than her own. These attitudes of Didit and
Outlook III
caused Sabo to leave home to live in
Gray Terminal
.
When Sabo returned home, Didit welcomed him, commenting on his awful smell, and introduced him to
Sterry
, his adopted younger brother.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Outlook and Didit horrified.
In the anime, after Sabo stole a small boat to escape and start his life as a pirate, Didit and her husband witnessed this departure, much to their shock.
To make matters worse, Sabo had accidentally cut in front of
World Noble
Jalmack
's ship, which caused him to be shot down. His mother and father both seemed horrified at this, either at the presumed death of their son or that their son would dare to obstruct a Celestial Dragon.
