Personalities
[
]
The decuplets are all loyal to their family and crew, as they have been seen joining Big Mom's army to avenge their fallen crewmate and brother
Cracker
,
going to crew meetings,
and joining
Oven
's force on
Cacao Island
to take down the Straw Hats.
The male decuplets seem to be more business-minded, as Newshi showed his reservations about gathering excessive amounts of strength to take on the
Straw Hat Pirates
. In contrast, the sisters seem to be more jovial, as they delighted in the atmosphere during the occupation of Cacao Island and anticipated having fun while standing guard.
They idolize
Katakuri
, but one of the brothers was also open to the possibility of
Monkey D. Luffy
defeating Katakuri, prompting Allmeg to hit him on the head.
They all became vengeful when they learned that Luffy defeated their brother and tried to attack the former.
Some of the brothers seem to be very sadistic, as Newichi, Newsan, and Newgo joyfully cheered as they attacked Luffy,
while another ruthlessly brutalized Pekoms.

Concludes non-canon section.
The next night, the decuplets reported to
Cacao Island
along with many of their
siblings
and crewmates to join Oven's battalion in preparation to ambush Luffy and the Straw Hats. While the brothers remarked on the ridiculous size of their forces, the sisters were looking forward to what was going to happen, and Nutmeg hugged Oven.
As the arranged time for the Straw Hats to arrive drew near, the decuplets brought out their scythes, and one of the brothers wondered if Luffy would defeat
Katakuri
. This caused Allmeg to hit him with her scythe as Oven scoffed at the idea. The pirates discussed how Luffy would escape and noted that
Charlotte Brûlée
would likely get captured, with Allmeg calling her clumsy. With five minutes to go, the Big Mom Pirates prepared to ambush Luffy.
Pekoms
came out of the
mirror
with a captive Brûlée, but the Big Mom Pirates quickly discovered that he was hiding Luffy, and one of the brothers decuplets raced to attack Luffy with his crewmates. When Luffy took to the air and Sanji saved him from
Raisin
, Fuyumeg was surprised when her brother was defeated. Shortly after, three of the brothers accompanied their brother
Yuen
into the sky to confront Luffy and Sanji, while Newshi helped his crewmates attack Pekoms. However, the skirmish was interrupted when
Germa 66
arrived at Cacao Island.
As Sanji and Luffy made their escape with Germa's assistance, the decuplets were in utter shock once they heard about Katakuri's defeat at Luffy's hands.
They later used the power of the
Gocha Gocha no Mi
to fight back against the Vinsmokes.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, one of the male decuplets was seen attacking Pekoms while the latter was restrained. Meanwhile, some of the other brothers attacked Sanji and Luffy together with Yuen. In the anime, the brothers attack Sanji and Luffy without Yuen until Pekoms fends them off. The sisters then fight Pekoms but are beaten back as well.
The decuplets merging together is shown onscreen in the anime and their clash with the Vinsmoke siblings is shown as well.
