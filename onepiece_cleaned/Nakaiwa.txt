Past
[
]
About forty-two years ago, Nakaiwa,
Oiwa
, and
Koiwa
began searching for the legendary
white boar
, intent on claiming the
Kurokoma Family
's bounty.
About a year later, they finally managed to find a baby boar, kidnapping it and beginning their return to the
Flower Capital
. On the way, the trio stopped at
Tsurujo
's teahouse to eat, where they bragged about having found the boar. However, they were overheard by
Kin'emon
, who followed them when they left and stole the boar from them.
Intending to steal it back, the three men took Tsurujo hostage and began heading down the mountain. They were soon attacked by the
Mountain God
, who smelled its baby's scent on them and ate Nakaiwa.
Nakaiwa's status after being eaten is unknown, though many of the people eaten by the Mountain God survived. His status 41 years later is unknown.
