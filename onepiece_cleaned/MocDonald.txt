MocDonald
was a
Wild Zombie
who lived on
Thriller Bark
.

Personality
MocDonald seemed to be quite laid back, since he was seen drinking with
Unigaro
. He was also quite terrified of
Luffy
and his crew, pleading the captain to overlook him.
History
Thriller Bark Arc
While riding in the carriage,
Nami
,
Usopp
, and
Chopper
came across MocDonald and a group of creatures singing about "prey".
Later, when the rest of the
Straw Hats
were exploring Thriller Bark and searching for Nami, Usopp, and Chopper, they came across him and Unigaro having drinks. Luffy grabbed him and asked him and Unigaro if they wanted to join his crew, only for MocDonald to beg to be overlooked.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
He was later seen alongside Unigaro and the other
zombies
from the forest, cheering on the graveyard zombies as they danced.
MocDonald later reappeared as one of the zombies fleeing for their lives as an out-of-control
Oars
infused with Luffy's stolen shadow roamed across Thriller Bark. He, alongside Cerberus and Unigaro, were washed away by the flood that Oars caused after he jumped into the moat.
Not long after, MocDonald was seen expressing his fear when Oars began to rampage and destroy the mansion.
Concludes non-canon section.
When Oars was defeated, MocDonald was among the forest and graveyard zombies expressing their concern. However, as soon as Moria stood back up, he and the other zombies cheered.
He turned back into a lifeless corpse after
Moria
absorbed all of the shadows at Thriller Bark.
