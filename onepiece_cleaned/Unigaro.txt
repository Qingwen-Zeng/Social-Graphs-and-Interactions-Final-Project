Thriller Bark Arc
While riding in the
Hildon
's carriage,
Nami
,
Usopp
, and
Chopper
came across Unigaro and a group of creatures singing about "prey".
Later, when the rest of the
Straw Hats
were exploring Thriller Bark and searching for Nami, Usopp, and Chopper, they came across him and MocDonald having drinks. Later, Luffy asked him and MocDonald to join his crew.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
He was later seen alongside MocDonald and the other
zombies
from the forest, cheering on the graveyard zombies as they danced.
Later, he reappeared alongside Cerberus and MocDonald, as they were washed away by the flood that Oars caused after he jumped into the moat.
Concludes non-canon section.
While Oars was fighting the Straw Hats, Unigaro stood in shock at the fact that they were able to put up a fight with Oars.
When Oars was defeated, Unigaro was among the forest and graveyard zombies expressing their concern. However, as soon as Moria stood back up, he and the other zombies cheered.
He turned back into a lifeless corpse after
Moria
absorbed all of the shadows at Thriller Bark.
