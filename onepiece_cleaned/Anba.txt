History

Past
[
]
Twenty-five years ago, Anba joined in a crowd of
Kouzuki Family
supporters as
Oden
confronted
Orochi
and
Kaidou
inside the palace. While there, poison arrows shot into two random people, one of which was Anba, and he collapsed while spitting up blood. The effects of the poison caused Anba to go blind.
When the faith in Oden waned across
Wano
over the next five years, Anba retained his belief, arguing that he could not see Oden dancing himself.
His status in the current day is unknown.
