Gambia the Missionary
is the
staff
officer of the
Barto Club
. He was also a gladiator competing at the

for the
Mera Mera no Mi
.
Appearance
[
]
Gambia is a slim man with his top front teeth missing. He has jaguar spot tattoos on his upper arms, along with a cross tattoo on his chest. He has light colored hair in a beehive style with sideburns.
He sports a headband with goggles and wears sunglasses. He also has a dark colored vest, and shorts that go to the middle of his thighs. He has high boots that start above his knees, and dark elbow pads. He also has nun-chucks sticking out of his shorts.
Personality
[
]
He appears to be a rather laid back and cheerful individual, and has thus far always been seen with a big smile on his face. He seems to respect big name criminals, as he called the people Maynard was talking about "cool guys".
Gambia also has a kind grandmother full of wisdom whom he loves enough that he is willing to regularly call her over the
Den Den Mushi
for her help, even if the advice she gives isn't reliable.
Like his captain, he idolizes the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
He can also be bold and daring like Bartolomeo, as he participated in burning the flag of one of the
Four Emperors
,
Shanks
.
Relationships
[
]
Barto Club
[
]
Bartolomeo
[
]
Though the true extent of their relationship is unknown,
Bartolomeo
most likely cares for Gambia's well being, as he went out of his way to confront
Maynard
and properly pay himÂ back for beating up Gambia.
Granny
[
]
As the Barto Club lacks a proper
navigator
due to its members originally being a street gang, they often call their grandmother, whom she raised their crew when they were young, for advice on what to do in sticky situations. He is evidently dear to her, since she calls Gambia by an affectionate nickname, and Gambia also deeply cares about her, as do the rest of the Barto Club. However, his grandma's advice usually ends up being housekeeping tips that are not useful in times of crisis at sea.
Enemies
[
]
Vice Admiral Maynard
[
]
Gambia encountered Maynard in the Colosseum and upon meeting him he questioned him over his affiliation to the Marines and not wanting his cover blown Maynard was forced to "silence" the pirate and leaving his unconscious body in the trash room. Maynard showed no remorse for his actions and told his associates to cross him off the list of pirates;
however, Bartolomeo personally went after Maynard and defeated him for his actions.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a member of a promising rookie's crew, he is presumably very strong. He is strong enough to warrant a bounty of
67,000,000. He was, however, no match for
Vice Admiral
Maynard
.
Weapons
[
]
Gambia was seen holding
nun-chucks
, but it is not known how proficient he is in using them.
History

Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Gambia is defeated by Maynard.
In the changing rooms of the
Corrida Colosseum
, Gambia walked in on
Vice Admiral
Maynard
whilst the undercover
Marine
was informing his comrades about the situation. Having overheard Maynard talking about the other competitors, Gambia questioned if he was talking to someone outside or to himself since Maynard was also taking notes. The Vice Admiral quickly rendered Gambia unconscious and then dumped him into the bathroom and garbage dump.
Days later, after the defeat of the
Donquixote Pirates
, the escape from
Dressrosa
, and the formation of the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
, the
Straw Hat Pirates
(except the ones who remained on the
Thousand Sunny
) were brought to the
Barto Club's ship
, where
Bartolomeo
's crew happily welcomed them.

]
Zou Arc
[

During a hail storm, the

New World
, the ship arrived at
Zou
.
After finding the Thousand Sunny, the Barto Club bid farewell to Luffy and his group.
