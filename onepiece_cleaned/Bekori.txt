Appearance
[
]
Bekori's later appearance, six years ago.
Bekori is a rotund man with large lips and a large nose that is slightly reddened at the tip. He has light shoulder-length hair, a short dark beard, and a neat dark mustache. He wears a crown, a light cravat, and a dark
royal
uniform.
Six years ago, Bekori's beard and mustache grew much scruffier, and gained a lighter appearance, likely related to his aging. He would be injured by Kuma, and forced to wear a bandage over his left eye.
Personality
[
]
Bekori is a stern, money-minded corrupt
king
who prioritized paying the Heavenly Tribute over the welfare of the country's citizens. He was sycophantically devoted to the
World Nobles
, doing whatever he felt necessary to appease them and brutalizing his countrymen to expand their domains wealth so he could earn greater favor. The king looked down on poor citizens from the south region and was perfectly fine with
enslaving
them due to their lack of financial contribution to the tariff. Bekori also naively believed that the rich people who can afford to pay the Celestial Dragon's tribute in the north of his kingdom would share his thought process of discriminating against the southern end, the truth of it was however, they were all horrified and disgusted by it.
When his wealthier statesmen and other nobility of the northern sector of the Kingdom protested his draconian actions in burning down the South of the country, Bekori had no qualms ordering them shot and killed, showing that the king only ever cared about himself and not his subjects or fiefdom.
He was also not above greater levels of scrutiny against individual freedoms of the civilian populace. King Bekori even setting up hidden surveillance Mushi' out and around the southern districts of his island nation to eavesdrop on conversations held there.
Taking an almost childlike bashfulness listening in on their complaints against him. As if he saw how their indignance at his ruthlessness and unfair treatment towards the elderly as complimentary praises. Showing a bit of a puerile side as well as high pride in his own stingy underhandedness.
In addition to his social ineptness, Bekori has shown to be extremely stupid and ignorant as displayed when his foolishly underestimating Kuma, who confronts the king for his actions in enslaving the transients of, as well as burning down the South part of the country, in which he threatens the Buccaneer with consequences of what he cites as a mere priest going against his decree, seemingly ignorant of the fact that Kuma has suffered at the hands of, and now had been dismantling tyrants like him for more than a decade. Both as a slave and going on to be a commander of the Revolutionary Army. Even after being chased out of the Kingdom and heavily injured by the latter, former king Bekori still refused to learn from his mistakes, going so far as to use malicious slander to placate himself as a victim after his fall to compensate his own misdeeds. Continually thinking rather lowly of Kuma as well as shallowly believing that with Marine support he could easily depose him and take back his throne. Only for the future Warlord of the Sea to sink the entire Marine armada with him still on it.

History
[
]
25 years ago, Bekori had recently taken the throne of
Sorbet Kingdom
, succeeding
Bulldog
.
22 years ago,
Bartholomew Kuma
protested against the Royal Army enslaving citizens from the south region. Afterwards, Bekori said that only the north region of Sorbet would be the actual kingdom, and any citizens who could not pay the Heavenly Tribute would be
enslaved
. Shortly after, the
Freedom Fighters
attacked the kingdom to liberate it. After the attack, the segregation and enslavement policies were terminated.
Six years ago, 16 years after his policies backfired, Bekori returned to power and set about accomplishing his original goal once more. This time, he attempted to eradicate the "deadweight" by burning them in their homes.
Bekori explained his motivations for this event to some of his subordinates, informing them that he got the idea from an
eastern nation
that did the same thing sometime in the past, gaining said King favor with the World Nobles. When the citizens and nobles protested against his horrific plans, Bekori ordered a few of them to be killed. Before this could be accomplished, Bartholomew Kuma arrived to take him down. Bekori threatened Kuma with consequences for raising up against him, but in response, Kuma used his
ability
to blow Bekori away along with the castle, resulting in the events going down in history as the
Solo Revolution
.
Bekori attempts to oust Kuma using a fleet of Marines.
Despite the second failure of his plans, Bekori survived but refused to give up or learn from his mistakes. He worked with the World Government to smear Kuma as a "tyrant" and himself as a benevolent ruler who was violently overthrown. Shortly after, Bekori brought a
Marine
fleet to Sorbet in an attempt to oust Kuma by force, although Kuma simply sank the entire armada.
It is unknown whether Bekori survived the attack or perished at sea.
