officer
of the
Revolutionary Army
, serving as the
Fish-Man Karate
assistant instructor. She started as a
slave
on
Mary Geoise
, but was then set free by
Fisher Tiger
's rampage. She sailed along with the
Sun Pirates
to reach her
home town
. At some point before the
Summit War of Marineford
, she joined the Revolutionary Army, where she often works alongside both
Sabo
and
Hack

She first debuted as a child during a flashback in the
Fishman Island Arc
. She made her reappearance during the
Dressrosa Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
When she appeared twelve years ago, Koala was a skinny girl with long, unkempt brown hair. She also had distinctively large and round purple eyes, similar to that of a koala, and was always smiling. She had on a dirty, short-sleeved collared shirt, which she wore under dark-brown overalls and a smudge on her right cheek. As a slave of the World Nobles, she had the mark of the Celestial Dragons on her back, which was replaced by the mark of the Sun Pirates by Fisher Tiger.
After a few weeks she had neat, shoulder-length hair, a yellow dress with an orange diamond pattern on the bottom of the dress that went around it, and a pair of orange loafers.
At age 23, she became taller (though she is still rather short as an adult at 160Â cm), slim, curvaceous, and has a pronounced hourglass figure. In the anime, her hair was changed from light brown to orange, now matching her depiction in the manga. She wears a crimson newsboy cap with gold goggles, a pink shirt with a frilly collar, a maroon short skirt, brown gloves, and black thigh-high stockings with brown high heeled boots.

Personality
[
]
Koala cries for the first time since enslavement.
Aladine
described Koala as having the lifestyle of a slave ingrained in her blood. Even after being set free for three years, she was very apologetic and vowed to never cry or stop working. The pirate explained that if a slave ever cried or stopped cleaning, they would be killed. Koala seemed to consider the Sun Pirates her masters, as she asked them if she would be killed if she stopped cleaning. Aladine also said that slaves panicked constantly, even when alone, and that they couldn't trust anyone. It is unknown if Koala also became paranoid in that regard.
When
Fisher Tiger
convinced her that his crew were not like the Celestial Dragons by throwing his gun into the ocean, she finally cried for the first time in years.
She then began to regard the Sun Pirates as her family rather than her masters, though this did not stop her habit of cleaning even when she was not asked.
By the time they reached her hometown, she genuinely liked the fish-men and mermen of the Sun Pirates, creating especially strong bonds with Hatchan and the future members of the Macro Pirates. She went as far as to actually hold Fisher Tiger's hands despite him trying to shake her off.
Koala displays her temperamental side after getting frustrated with Sabo.
At the age of 23, Koala has become much more mature, having shown sympathy towards Sabo for not being able to save Ace, telling him he should not let his guilt get to him.
She has also become rather playful and cheery, having gleefully hugged
Robin
after meeting her
and also teasing Sabo about him crying upon meeting Luffy again.
She has also been shown to have a temper, as she got angry with Sabo for fighting Fujitora instead of staying at his post and comically pinched his cheeks for his disregard for his duties as a Revolutionary.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Koala's only known family is her mother. It is clear she loves her mother very much, having hugged her after reuniting with her when Tiger brought her home. It is unknown if Koala ever discovered her mother and the other people on her home island betrayed Tiger by selling him out to the Marines.
Sun Pirates
[
]
Koala was loved by much of the crew during her time with the Sun Pirates. As the crew included former slaves, they understood the plight that Koala had suffered and why she acted the way she did. They treated her and protected her while she traveled with them and were very sad to see her go. Out of all of them, she was especially fond of
Hachi
,
Jinbe
, and
Macro
.
Fisher Tiger
[
]
Koala was deeply thankful to
Fisher Tiger
for freeing her and returning her home. Though she grew fond of the fish-men, Fisher Tiger himself admitted on his deathbed that he was unable to love humans, and therefore was unable to return any affection towards her. He even refused to hold her hand, though he still smiled when she returned home.
Arlong
[
]
Unlike the other members of the crew,
Arlong
spent the entire time objecting to her presence on the Sun Pirates' ship, attempting to beat or kill her just for being a human. Koala seemed to have left a long-term impression on Arlong. Notably, in the final moments of his fight with Luffy, Arlong stated that as long as Nami was fed and well-clothed, she was happy in his eyes. As a slave, Koala had little to her name and what made Koala happy were the things she had missed while being a slave such as nice clothes and suitable meals.
Nico Robin
[
]
Koala seems to have developed a very friendly relationship with
Nico Robin
, who was rescued by the revolutionaries just prior to the timeskip. In a conversation with Sabo on Dressrosa, she commented on how she had not seen Robin in a while.
Later on, Koala hugs Robin when she does see her again.
Revolutionary Army
[
]
When she was only 14 years old, three years after Fisher Tiger's death, Koala joined the
Revolutionary Army
.
Though her official role is assistant
Fish-Man Karate
instructor, Koala is shown to work closely under the army's top leadership.
Sabo
[
]
Koala is good friends with
Sabo
, having worked with him since she was a teenager. As such, she's come to know him personally quite well, being aware of Sabo's relationship with Ace and Luffy as well as his guilt for not being at Marineford to help save Ace. She consoled Sabo by telling him that it was impossible to know whether Sabo would have made a difference or not. Even though they are friendly to each other most of the time, Koala comically pinched Sabo's cheeks when he frustrated her for fighting Fujitora and neglecting his duties as a Revolutionary by leaving his post. Although she can get irritated with him from time to time, Koala cried when she believed him to be dying and was distressed when she thought he would leave the Revolutionaries after he regained his memories but was relieved when he stated he was not leaving. Overall, Koala's relationship with Sabo is very similar to
Nami
's relationship with Luffy.
Koala was greatly concerned for Sabo's safety after a recent incident regarding him at Levely was revealed in the newspaper.
Hack
[
]
Hack
is a fellow colleague and
Fish-Man Karate
practitioner in the Revolutionary Army. He intended to get into contact with her after losing the
Corrida Colosseum
tournament but was unable to as he was turned into a toy by
Sugar
and forced to work. He complained that Koala was waiting for him to report, unaware that she had forgotten him due to the effects of the
Hobi Hobi no Mi
.
After Sugar was knocked out and Koala regained her memories of Hack, Koala was quick to inform him that Sabo was making his way to the basement. Both share a dislike for Sabo's tendency of leaving his post during missions. Hack was the one responsible for bringing Koala into the Revolutionary Army when she was 14. She studied Fish-Man Karate under his tutelage, eventually becoming a Master Assistant Fish-Man Karate Instructor.
Monkey D. Dragon
[
]
Dragon
is the leader of the Revolutionary Army whom Koala serves faithfully. After Koala returned to Baltigo following the mission to Dressrosa, Dragon thanked her for helping them find their lost comrades and her discovery of weapons on the island. He also appears to trust her well enough to carry out important tasks such as summoning the other Revolutionary leaders.
Belo Betty
[
]
Koala seems to have a causal relationship with
Belo Betty
despite the East Army Commander being one of her senior officers. Belo muses on the contradiction in Koala's reason for becoming a revolutionary. She notes Koala wants to depose the World Government to help fish-men but the
Ryugu Kingdom
is one of their affiliates. Despite this, Koala happily responds that she agrees with Dragon's crusade to dethrone the Celestial Dragons and not the World Government itself.
Bartholomew Kuma
[
]
Not much is known about her relationship with
Kuma
but she was in utter disbelief when he joined the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
. After he was rescued from slavery, Koala was obviously sad when she saw Kuma was now just a
mindless machine
.
Enemies
[
]
World Nobles
[
]
Koala was originally terrified of the
Celestial Dragons
due to them enslaving her. She coped with this problem by smiling and blindly complying with their orders to avoid punishment. However, after being liberated by the Sun Pirates and joining the Revolutionary Army at a later age, she has grown to despise them for their depravity and continued practice of slavery. She tells Belo Betty that she fully supports Dragon's crusade to dethrone them.
Marines
[
]
It is unknown if Koala discovered her hometown betrayed the Sun Pirates to the
Marines
to ensure she would not be returned to enslavement. She is cautious about the naval military as seen by her reprimanding Sabo for deliberately engaging one of their Admirals despite the possibility of attracting their notice.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
She has been shown to have certain skills like being able to take down larger enemies and great agility and can make a big jump from the stands to all the way down to an underground port while bringing Sabo clothes to wear.
Her position indicates that in terms of combat, she is above simple revolutionary soldiers, as she seems to have a decent level within fish-men standards despite being human.
Fish-Man Karate
[
]
Further information:
Fish-Man Karate
She is skilled enough at Fish-Man Karate to be able to teach it and was able to defeat an opponent much larger than her. Not being a fishwoman and still being able to learn the art makes her more impressive.
In the anime, she is shown to be proficient enough to defeat a group of five armed men with only a single strike each.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Tiger covers Koala's slave mark with his jolly roger.
At some point in her childhood, Koala was kidnapped and sold into slavery to the World Nobles.
When she was eight years old,
Fisher Tiger
attacked
Mary Geoise
and indiscriminately freed countless slaves. Koala managed to escape with a group of people and fled to an island. Unfortunately, the inhabitants there had no way of returning her to her homeland. When the
Sun Pirates
visited there three years after she was freed, the inhabitants asked them to take the little girl home. After Koala introduced herself and thanked Tiger for freeing her, she boarded the Sun Pirates' ship.
Koala was instantly met with hostility by
Arlong
, who hit her for being human, but was restrained by
Hatchan
. Tiger gave the girl the Mark of the Sun to cover up her slave mark. He then told the girl that she was allowed to cry if she wished and made a vow to return the little girl to her home. Koala then began to cry.
The last time Koala ever sees Tiger.
The Sun Pirates were able to find an
Eternal Pose
for her home island,
Foolshout Island
. When they arrive, she bid everyone farewell, and Tiger took her to her village. The whole town rejoiced, but everyone was still afraid of Tiger.
Later, she heard some strange noises. When she asked if anyone else heard them, her mother replied no. The truth was that Fisher Tiger was attacked because people from a previous island informed the
Marines
about the Sun Pirates while the people on this island allowed it on the condition that the Marines overlook the fact that she was a released slave and not take her back.
Three years after Fisher Tiger's death, at the age of fourteen, Koala joined the
Revolutionary Army
and she became a
Fish-Man Karate
assistant instructor. She became acquainted with
Sabo
and
Hack
.
Three and a half years before the current storyline, Koala and Sabo read news that
Bartholomew Kuma
became a
Warlord of the sea
much to her disbelief.
During the Timeskip
[
]
She was worried when Sabo had a mental breakdown after remembering his brother,
Ace
. When Sabo awoke from his three-day coma, Koala cried in relief.
After
Nico Robin
agreed to meet Dragon, Koala became acquainted with her.
She, alongside
Sabo
, took part in Robin's training, teaching her about the basics of
Fish-Man Karate
that could then be applied in future situations.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Koala, Sabo, and Hack arrived at
Dressrosa
in order to put a stop to a weapons trade that has been promoting wars throughout the world.
Koala sat on a pile of defeated enemies and talked to
Sabo
on the
Den Den Mushi
, inquiring about his meeting with
Monkey D. Luffy
. She told him that Ace's death could not have been prevented by him. Then, when Sabo told her to inform him if anymore underground movements happened, Koala told him that she would.
Later, Koala disguised herself as a member of the
Donquixote Pirates
, managed to get inside the
Corrida Colosseum
, and was relieved that she had arrived just in time to watch the next round.
When the
toys
in the audience transformed back into their original forms, Koala informed Hack that Sabo was heading to the basement as he demolished the entire arena.
Koala, Sabo, and Hack reveal themselves.
After Sabo acquired the power of the
Mera Mera no Mi
, destroyed the arena, and exposed the underground, Koala returned his clothes to him. At the underground trade port, she returned Sabo's hat as the Revolutionary Army members revealed to
Rebecca
their objective in Dressrosa.
After Koala and Sabo reunited with Robin and met
Usopp
, they later watched in shock as
Doflamingo
initiated his
"Birdcage"
plan and created a "game" which gave the citizens of Dressrosa a choice to either kill him or a list of people he offered to them.
Doflamingo announced his hit list, which included Sabo, Robin, Rebecca, and Usopp. With Usopp's new followers turned against them, Koala, Sabo, Hack, Robin, Rebecca, Usopp,
Bartolomeo
, and the
Tontatta
dwarves
fled from the mob.
Instead of going to the surface with the others, Koala remained in the underground trade port to continue her investigation. She discovered that the ships at the trade port were actually merchant ships disguised as pirate ships.
She later met up with Sabo in front of the new King's Plateau after he fought
Admiral
Fujitora
, and scolded Sabo for going off on his own and fighting the admiral on his own accord.
Koala later infiltrated the palace and then contacted Sabo to come, saying that Luffy's life was in danger.
She was spying on
Jesus Burgess
and wondered about what he was up to.
When Luffy became exhausted, Burgess made a move and Koala quickly alerted Sabo.
By the time Doflamingo was defeated, Koala, Hack, and some other revolutionaries took care of some business at the underground trade port, where they waited for Sabo. Koala tried to contact Sabo, but he did not respond until after he defeated Burgess. When Koala finally contacted Sabo, he asked her if she found a list. Soon after he hung up on her, Koala took her annoyance out on one of her comrades.
The revolutionaries later left Dressrosa and they took all the weapons and evidence relating to the Donquixote Pirates' smuggling operation before
CP0
could recover them.

programming. Sabo himself called on a Den Den Mushi
and denied killing Cobra. He attempted to report what he had seen in Pangaea Castle, but the World Government cut off the signal and destroyed the
Lulusia Kingdom
.
Later Koala along with the other captains' witnessed Sabo's return to Momoiro Island along with the Lulusia survivors. At first, Koala was upset that Sabo had not signaled her or the others of his safety but quickly broke down, relieved that he was safe.

World
's secret's in the next ten minutes.
