Tsurube falls into boiling oil.
Twenty years ago, Tsurube was assigned to watch over
Kouzuki Oden
and direct him into pot of boiling oil for his execution. When Oden turned to
Kurozumi Orochi
and
Kaidou
, and requested a chance to survive, Tsurube mocked him and hurried him into the boiling oil. However, he accidentally slipped and fell into the pot himself, immediately receiving fatal burns and perishing in front of the onlookers after barely climbing out of the oil.
