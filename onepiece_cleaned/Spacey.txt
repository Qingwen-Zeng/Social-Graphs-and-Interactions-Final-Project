History
[
]
One day Spacey along with other automata and Dr. Tsukimi were watching the moon and eating snacks
when suddenly a huge explosion happened on the moon. The explosion was of unknown origin. In his shock, Tsukimi swallowed his dumpling without chewing and suffocated to death.
After burying the professor, the four automata traveled to the moon (each one with a balloon)
to take revenge on the one who caused the explosion that resulted in the accidental death of their creator.
Upon reaching the moon, they found the
Space Pirates
and despite overwhelming odds, they fought the captain of the Space Pirates but were easily overpowered, so Spacey fled, leaving the other three behind.
Enel
came across Spacey
and
shocked
the automata, reviving him.
Spacey thanked Enel and led him to where his fellow automata lay defeated.
While Spacey was mourning them, a Space Pirate ambushed him and Enel.
Spacey watched as Enel attacked the Space Pirates and destroyed their ship.
After loading the other automata onto a cart, Spacey pulled them over to Enel, whom he thanked for avenging Tsukimi. However, Enel struck all four with lightning,
which revived them. They then followed Enel as he explored an ancient underground city and inadvertently activated the automata stored there.
Seeing Enel as their savior, both groups of automata decided to follow Enel as his army.
