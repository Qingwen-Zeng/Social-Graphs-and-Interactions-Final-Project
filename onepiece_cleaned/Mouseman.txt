Personality

Mouseman is a staunch supporter of
Wano Country
's social hierarchy, and so convinced the yokozuna
Urashima
to use his high status to ensure that the commoner woman
Kiku
would marry him no matter what, even suggesting that he kill and destroy everything close to her so he would be the only one who could support her.
While he does support Urashima's high standing and suggesting him to take full advantage of it, Mouseman is not above insulting such people, as he made a passive remark of how Urashima was an idiot for taking too much into consideration of taking Kiku.
