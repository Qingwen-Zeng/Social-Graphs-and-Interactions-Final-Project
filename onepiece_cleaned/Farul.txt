Prior to the Block D battle, Cavendish rode Farul into

to scold the audience for booing and jeering at
Rebecca
.
Cavendish rode Farul again when he accompanied
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Roronoa Zoro
,
Trafalgar D. Water Law
, and some of the Corrida Colosseum fighters to fight against the
Donquixote Pirates
.
Later on, it carried Cavendish to the first level of the King's Plateau.
After Luffy broke through to the second level and left behind
Ucy
, Cavendish offered Luffy and Law a ride to the next level.
Kyros
jumped on Farul's back, much to Cavendish's surprise and anger.
After carrying them to the third level,
Farul was attacked and bitten by one of
Sugar
's nutcrackers until Luffy punched the toy away.
It remained unconscious for the rest of the fight.
Three days after the defeat of
Donquixote Doflamingo
, Farul had recovered. After the
Marines
were mobilized to pursue the
Straw Hat Pirates
and their allies, Cavendish rode on Farul once again as he and the other gladiators assisted the Straw Hats in their escape.
