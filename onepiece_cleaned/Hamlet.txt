Hamlet's outfit during the post-raid festival.
Due to the nature of his SMILE transformation, Hamlet has an entire giraffe's body growing from his backside starting from the neck, thus leaving his main body hanging several meters in the air. He has long, shaggy bright green hair and possesses the ears and
ossicones
of a giraffe. He wears a regal-looking cloak that leaves his chest exposed and has pronounced shoulder pads, dark gloves, and also wears giraffe-printed pants and boots with spurs.
Personality

]
Hamlet is very cocky, speaking in a condescending tone to his underlings and being confident that he would easily deal with the threats they were afraid of.
Abilities and Powers

]
As a Shinuchi, Hamlet has authority over the lower-ranking members of the
Beasts Pirates

Devil Fruit
[
]
Hamlet ate a Giraffe
SMILE
(
キリンの
SMILE
,
Kirin no Sumairu
?
)
, which caused the entire body of a giraffe, starting from the top of the neck, to emerge from his upper back. The giraffe body is strong enough to stay upright and support Hamlet's weight, but only barely, as it is constantly shown trembling.
Weapons

History
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Hamlet and Fourtricks defeated.
When the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
invaded
Onigashima
on the day of the
Fire Festival
, Hamlet and
Fourtricks
confronted their subordinates who were being easily beaten by
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Sanji
, and
Jinbe
. They thought little of their subordinates' worries and confidently confronted the trio, only to instantly be beaten aside.
Later, Hamlet was fed a dango created by
Kurozumi Tama
with the
Kibi Kibi no Mi
which "tamed" him and caused him to be loyal to her. When Tama spoke to the tamed Gifters in the fortress to aid the alliance in bringing down
Kaidou
, Hamlet obeyed her and began attacking his crewmates.
Nami
and
Usopp
later recruited Hamlet to help carry
Komachiyo
away from the fires. After the group encountered
Kin'emon
's legs, Usopp attached the legs to Hamlet and rode the Gifter to the rest of the
samurai
's body.
After Kin'emon's legs were reattached, Usopp was waylaid by more Beasts Pirates. While
Izou
held off the Beasts Pirates, Hamlet and Usopp grabbed
Kikunojo
and Kin'emon and pulled them to the floor below.
When they were unable to continue due to the fire, Usopp sprayed water with a Pop Green, which was engulfed in flames. Hamlet pointed out the ineffectiveness of the technique, so the sniper yelled at him to shut up and give him a hand as he promised Izo that he would save Kikunojo and Kin'emon, as well as wanting to survive himself. Hamlet then asked him to save him too,
which Usopp did not need to do, as their floor was later flushed by water from the upper levels.
That evening, he enjoyed the
Flower Capital
's festival and joined everyone in the toast.
