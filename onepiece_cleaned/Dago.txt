Dago
is one of the
Franky Family
's
Kairiki Destroyers
.
Appearance
[
]
Dago's initial colorscheme in the anime.
Dago is a large, somewhat rotund man with short, afro-style orange hair and thick sideburns. He wears the
Franky Family
uniform, consisting of a metal lederhosen with a pink star and a pair of specialized goggles, as well as brown pants.
Like the other
Kairiki Destroyers
, Dago is an abnormally large human, reaching up above the legs of regular-sized
giants
and towering above the other members of the Franky Family.
In his initial appearance in the anime, Dago's hair was incorrectly colored black. This was corrected in the
Episode of Merry
special.
Personality
[
]
Dago is very loyal to the
Franky Family
and
Franky
himself, referring to him as his big brother. He is very confident in his strength and the size of the Family, even laughing when he saw
Luffy
attacking the
Franky House
.
His loyalty to Franky is such that he is even willing to invading the
World Government
's island on his behalf, participating in the raid on
Enies Lobby
with the rest of the Family.
He has a tendency to say his name,
-dago
(
だゴ
?
)
, when speaking.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Due to Dago's large size, he has remarkable strength, well above that of an average human. Having gained his immense strength from his experience dismantling ships, Dago is considered one of the strongest members of the Franky Family,
though his strength isn't enough to handle more powerful opponents like
giants
.
Weapons
[
]
Dago wears thick iron armor strong enough to even resist cannon shots from battleships; despite its fearsome reputation, however, it was destroyed by Luffy in a single attack.
While in the
Franky House
, Dago wielded a large
axe
, though he was defeated by
Luffy
before getting a chance to display his prowess in using it.
While raiding
Enies Lobby
, he instead carried a massive rifle, resembling a cannon.
History
[
]
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
Dago was at the
Franky House
when the
Franky Family
members who robbed
Usopp
returned with their gains.
He participated in the subsequent celebration, and when the
Straw Hat Pirates
attacked, confidently challenged
Luffy
, but was taken out in a single attack.
Soon after, Dago recovered from his battle with Luffy, and joined the rest of the Franky Family as they followed after the
Rocketman
to
Enies Lobby
.
When a large wave threatened to derail them, he participated in the Franky Family's barrage of bullets using a handheld cannon, and cheered with
Ottoland
when they made it through.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Upon reaching Enies Lobby, the Franky Family, including Dago, charged onto the island to begin their assault.
Forcing their way into the island, Dago and the other
Destroyers
made their way to the
main gate
, successfully pushing it open and allowing their forces through. There, they ran into the
giants
Oimo
and
Kashii
, stopping them in their tracks.
After confirming with the other Destroyers, the trio charged into the giants in a bid to motivate the other members of the Franky Family; however, Dago was easily taken out by Oimo and collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
Later, when escaping from Enies Lobby, Dago's unconscious body was tied to Kashii with rope.
At some point between Kashii being fired on by the
Buster Call
and their exit from the island, Dago woke up, and cheered aboard the
Puffing Tom
as they rolled away.
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Dago participated in the party thrown to celebrate everyone's escape from Enies Lobby.
He later joined the Franky Family when they begged Luffy to take Franky out to sea.
After Luffy accepted, the entire family went to convince Franky, though he initially refused to join; in response, the Family stole his underwear and drew him to the
Thousand Sunny
, where Luffy attempted to recruit him.
As Franky finally accepted Luffy's invitation, the entire Family cried, watching from a distance.
After the Straw Hats left
Water 7
, the Franky Family began planning for the future, running into
Iceburg
and being invited to join the
Galley-La Company
.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, the
Kairiki Destroyers
are not carried off
Enies Lobby
by
Oimo
and
Kashii
, leaving their return to the
Puffing Tom
unexplained.
