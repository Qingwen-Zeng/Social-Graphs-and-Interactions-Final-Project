Chapter 54
.
Pearl the Iron Wall
is the commander of the
Krieg Pirates
' second unit.
Due to his actions, he can be considered the tertiary antagonist of the
Baratie Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
A towering man, Pearl's ensemble includes two large iron plates covering his front and backside, as well as two small plates with large pearls embedded in them for strong, blunt attacks. When introduced, he claims that he is "a shield man", but also "a dandy man", referring to the iron plates he wears on his body, as well as his notably handsome face.
In the manga, as seen on Volume 8's cover page, Pearl's iron plates have an orange and white design, and his hair is also red, while in the anime, his plates are shining metal gray with black linings, and his hair is black.
During the Egghead Island Arc, Pearl now dons a much bulkier version of his previous armor, which now covers his entire torso, as well as larger pads on his arms. He also appears to have grown his hair out longer.
Personality
[
]
Pearl appeared to be somewhat cocky, claiming to have never lost a drop of blood in battle, as well as calling himself "dandy". He also shares Krieg's belief of using any means to achieve victory, even if it means playing dirty. However, should he see even a drop of his own blood spilled, he goes into a panicked frenzy, possibly suffering from
hemophobia
or having his perfect record tarnished anger him. Also, despite his arrogance, Pearl acknowledges the superior strength of
Gin
and Krieg.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the
commander
of the Krieg Pirates' second unit, Pearl has authority over said division, under only Krieg.
Weapons
[
]
Pearl ignites his shields to defend himself.
Befitting his epithet, Pearl is clad in iron plates to serve as his armor which grants him a high-level defense, as well as his gauntlets for damage augmentation.
This makes him impervious to bullets and, said by his crewmates, cannonballs. With this, he claimed that he has gone 61 battles without losing a drop of blood, and also boasted about being able to take a battleship's cannon shot uninjured.
Although Pearl has iron armor and uses his gauntlets to block his unarmored face, if he is by chance injured, Pearl is noted to start panicking, protecting himself by causing friction sparks to ignite his body with a defensive layer of intensely hot flames, becoming "Fire Pearl"; surprisingly, Pearl is not affected by the high heat of the flames that coat his own body. He is able to set people alight with flames in this state. He can also shoot multiple fireballs, composed of pearls that are ignited by his flames.
Pearl's attacks all involve bashing and/or crushing his enemies with his hard shields, as well as using his fire to augment his strikes, the latter of which may be more indiscriminate, as he nearly burned down the
Baratie
, the ship that his crew planned to take as their new flagship. This, coupled with his frenzy from bleeding, caused even Krieg to become worried.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Pearl is said to have been raised in a jungle, which is reflected in his habit to start a fire whenever he feels he is in danger.
He eventually joined the
Krieg Pirates
and became the commander of the second division. Eventually, the crew tried to conquer the
Grand Line
, in which they were overwhelmed by
Dracule Mihawk
on the seventh day. The remaining 100 members managed to retreat and return to the East Blue due to a storm preventing the
Dreadnaught Sabre
from being destroyed by the
Warlord of the Sea
. However, Pearl and the rest of the crew were severely weakened from starvation.
East Blue Saga
[

Baratie Arc
[
]
Gin shatters Pearl's iron shield.
After arriving at the
Baratie
, Krieg fed Pearl in order to replenish his strength. During the battle against the chefs, Pearl climbed onto the ocean-going restaurant and defeated
Patty
and
Carne
, both cooks who are strong enough to hold back the lower crew members. Pearl was then initially (and accidentally) knocked out after Luffy injured him and made him bleed for the first time in battle.
Pearl soon recovered and thrashed Sanji around (as
Gin
was holding
Zeff
hostage).
However, Gin knocked out Pearl himself by shattering his iron plate shielding, claiming he reserved the right to kill Sanji himself.
Pearl was last seen being carried off by a boat along with the rest of the defeated crew.

Adaptation Differences

In the anime, the flames created by Pearl in his "Fire Pearl" technique appear blue.
However, in the

Digitally Colored Manga
, and
Episode of East Blue
, the flames have an ordinary yellow-orange color.
Pearl's jungle background is discussed in the manga but not the anime.
In the
live-action series
