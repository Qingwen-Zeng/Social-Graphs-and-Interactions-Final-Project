History

Whole Cake Island Saga
[

Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
An hour and twenty-four minutes before the scheduled rendezvous of
Monkey D. Luffy
, Chiboust joined many of his siblings and subordinates in occupying
Cacao Island
in preparation for ambushing the young pirate if he were to escape from
Mirro-World
.
Fifty-two minutes later, he watched as his siblings discussed how Luffy would use
Brûlée
to escape. Afterwards, five minutes before Luffy was set to appear, Chiboust and the Big Mom Pirates prepared for battle.
To his surprise, however,
Pekoms
instead came out with a captive Brûlée. Pekoms attempted to use his
Sulong
form against his crewmates, but was quickly assaulted and exposed the hidden Luffy in the process. Chiboust and some of his crewmates held Pekoms down and tried to gouge his eyes out to stop his Sulong transformation, but the scuffle was soon interrupted by the arrival of
Germa 66
.
As the
Vinsmoke Family
facilitated Luffy and
Sanji
's escape, Chiboust was utterly shocked when Brûlée revealed that Luffy had defeated
Katakuri
.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, Chiboust complained about how Luffy had humiliated the Big Mom Pirates at the Tea Party and that he would get revenge by killing him. In the manga, he had no speaking lines when he debuted nor did he have his name or birth order revealed.
The anime erroneously introduced him as the 29th son of the Charlotte Family, when in Oda's sketches he is stated to be the 30th son.
