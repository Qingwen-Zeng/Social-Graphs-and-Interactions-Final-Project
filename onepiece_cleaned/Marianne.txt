Marianne
,
also known as the
"Flag-Bearer of Freedom"
and more commonly by her alias
Miss Goldenweek
, was an
officer agent
of
Baroque Works
and the partner of
Mr. 3
.
She is currently working as a painter at the new
Spider's Cafe
alongside many of her former colleagues.
She is the secondary antagonist of the
Little Garden Arc
and the protagonist in
Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
.
Appearance
[
]
Marianne is a teenager with a childish appearance, with relatively large eyes and circles of blush on her cheeks. She is fairly short in stature and wears her dark red hair tied in twin braids. Her attire consists of a wide-brimmed pink hat with a green band, a dark blue T-shirt with the word "GOLDEN" written on it in pink (orange in the anime), a sky blue cloud-patterned button-down shirt, a maroon-colored overalls skirt with the top folded down, blue striped stockings, and big red shoes with white cuffs and white soles.
After the events of her cover story, Marianne now wears an apple-shaped beret in place of her brimmed hat, as well as a scarf.
Personality
[
]
Miss Goldenweek having a picnic in the midst of battle.
Marianne is laid back to the extreme and never passes up a good chance to relax. For instance, she set up a picnic during an ongoing battle. Another example of her easygoing nature was when she sat a few feet away from a cup of tea, apparently too lazy to walk over to it and pick it up herself. She skillfully conveyed this message to her partner using only her eyes, and when
Mr. 3
understood, he chided her but brought her the cup anyway. She is often seen snacking on a piece of senbei whenever not doing anything in particular.
Regardless of her laid back persona, Marianne takes her missions rather seriously, as she prevented Luffy from destroying her partner's Candle Set to save his crew.
Relationships
[
]
Baroque Works
[
]
Miss Goldenweek cares greatly for the other members of the organization. She formed a strong bond with
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
while on
Little Garden
and was willing to go to a
Marine
base to free the rest of the captive agents. She and Mr. 3 had a relationship of mutual respect due to their partnership, and they bonded over a shared appreciation of hot tea, among other things.
Enemies
[
]
For the most part, Miss Goldenweek seemed neither afraid of nor aggressive toward her opponents. She was fairly indifferent to the majority of the
Straw Hat Pirates
but seemed to be scared of
Usopp
when he shot a fire star and Luffy and
Karoo
when they charged her.
Abilities and Powers

Further information:
Colors Trap
Marianne utilizes her unique skills as a painter to employ a special type of hypnosis based on colored paint. In this way, she can change a person's personality through the use of certain colors, influencing their behavior as she sees fit and forcing them to do whatever the trap suggests no matter what.
History
[
]
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Little Garden Arc
[
]
After the initial uncovering and subsequent flight of
Princess
Vivi
from the organization,
Crocodile
sent Miss Goldenweek and
Mr. 3
to lie in wait for Vivi and her
Straw Hat escorts
on the island of
Little Garden
.
In a
wax building
, Miss Goldenweek slept while Mr. 3 informed
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
about their mission take down the
giants
due to a
200,000,000 bounty on their heads. Mr. 5 reported he had successfully poisoned
Dorry
so the
Baroque Works
crew could easily take down the giants.
After Mr. 3 poured the tea, Miss Goldenweek woke and listened as Mr. 3 explained his plan.
Miss Goldenweek vs. Luffy.
Miss Goldenweek stood at Mr. 3's side while he handled the giants.
When the Straw Hats interfered, Miss Goldenweek had a picnic instead of fighting. After
Monkey D. Luffy
punched Mr. 3 through his wax wall, she painted a black design on the ground where Luffy stood, which caused him to reject
Nami
's pleas for help.
Miss Goldenweek demonstrated the effects of the other Colors Traps, finishing with a green design on Luffy's shirt so that he would calmly join her for tea.
Usopp
rescued Luffy by using a
Kaen Boshi
to incinerate Luffy's shirt.
Mr. 3 then emerged from the forest, and Miss Goldenweek painted his wax suit of armor. When Usopp realized that they could still save their comrades, Miss Goldenweek confirmed that they could, for which Mr. 3 admonished her.
After Mr. 3's wax structures were melted, he and Miss Goldenweek fled into the forest, and she painted the wax clones that Mr. 3 made of himself. However, Luffy saw through the ruse, and
Karoo
spotted Miss Goldenweek trying to sneak away.
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
[
]
Marianne, Gem, and Mikita hid out on Little Garden in the wax house. Upon finding out that Baroque Works had been exposed after
Crocodile
's defeat in
Arabasta
, they flew from the island on top of a pterodactyl with the help of a Colors Trap in order to go visit their comrades in jail.
However, the symbol was washed away in a storm and the three were dropped onto
Kyuka Island
where
Hina
,
Jango
, Ironfist
Fullbody
, and their
Marine unit
happened to be vacationing. Although the Officer Agents disguised themselves, Hina still recognized them and attacked them, only managing to capture Mikita.
Later, while
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
fought Hina, Marianne and Gem rescued Mikita and, by painting a black design, stole Hina's ship along with some of her Marines.
The fugitive agents work in the new Spiders Cafe.
They sailed to the Marine prison and pretended to be caught so they could enter. After locating and freeing their comrades, they broke out of the prison, but Crocodile and
Daz Bonez
stayed behind.
As they sailed away, Miss Goldenweek painted a rainbow swirl in the sky, transforming them all into their dreams.
They later remodeled the
Cactus Saloon
into a new
Spiders Cafe
, where they all work together.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Her name, "Goldenweek", comes from a series of national holidays in Japan known as Golden Week, similar to Spring Break in the United States or Half Term in the UK.
Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek's involvement in Little Garden was removed in the
4Kids
dub, but she is still mentioned during Vivi's Baroque Works debriefing and still featured in the localized
Grand Battle
video game, albeit renamed as "Miss April Fools Day". During Vivi's Baroque Works debriefing, Nami commented on Miss April Fools Day, saying, "Isn't she too young to be a creep?" despite the fact that the two had never met.
