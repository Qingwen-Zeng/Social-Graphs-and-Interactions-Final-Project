Inbi
is a member of the
Numbers
in the
Beasts Pirates
, representing the number "one".
Appearance
[
]
Like the other Numbers, Inbi is immensely tall, towering over even normal giants and being similar in size to an ancient giant.
He is similar in appearance to common cultural depictions of Satan or the devil, possessing long and pointy ears, a handlebar mustache, dark hair (blonde in the anime) with a prominent widow's peak, and a pair of horns that extend from the area above his ears and curve upward. His face is often seen curved into a sinister expression, and like
Kunyun
, his teeth is mostly straight with a pair of sharp canines. He wears a light-colored (dark blue in the anime) shirt, dark-colored pants, small ring-shaped earrings, long boots ending in a cuff, and a Shimenawa-like rope around his waist like a belt. His hands have sharp, dark-colored fingernails.
He appears to have the
daiji
壱 ("one") tattooed on the right side of his chest.
In the anime, he has a brown skin, and his horns and fingernails are colored purple.
Personality
[
]
Like the other Numbers, Inbi likes to consume alcohol, as evidenced by the multiple sake jars beside him. However, Inbi is shown holding a cup rather than a barrel, and does not appear intoxicated, suggesting he has better drinking habits than the others. He also possesses a
unique laugh
which plays off his name: "Ibibibibibi"
(
イビビビビビ
?
)
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Inbi's abilities have not been shown, but given his nature as an artificial ancient
giant
, he is likely tremendously powerful.
History

Past
[
]
Sometime in the past, Inbi was part of an experiment on
Punk Hazard
that attempted to artificially recreate the ancient
giants
. The experiment was deemed a failure, and Inbi and his fellow test subjects were eventually bought by
Kaidou
, becoming known as the
Numbers
and residing on
Onigashima
.
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Five days before the
Fire Festival
, the Numbers arrived in
Hakumai
via Mogura Harbor and headed toward Onigashima with
Scratchmen Apoo
.
Inbi and fellow Numbers
Fuga
and
Zanki
were eating and drinking in a
Skull Dome
chamber together, and were not participating in the war that broke out between the
Beasts Pirates
and
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
. They were eventually joined in the room by Apoo and
X Drake
.
Inbi sat while Apoo and Drake fought. After
Yamato
passed through the room, Apoo chased after him and ordered Inbi and Zanki to follow him.
After Apoo and Drake encountered and engaged the CP0 on their chase, Apoo abandoned the fight alongside Inbi, running down to the 2nd Basement Floor.
When they were unable to escape from the basement due to the fire, Inbi tried to break through a wall, but the wall was too hot and burned his hand. Apoo scolded him for complaining and urged him to sacrifice his arm so they could survive. Inbi grew irritated, so Apoo asked him if he wanted to fight.
They were saved from the flames by the water with which
Raizo
and
Jinbe
flooded the castle.
A week after the
raid on Onigashima
, Apoo and Inbi met up with the pirates repairing their ships at
Tokage Port
.
