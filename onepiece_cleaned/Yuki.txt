History
[
]
102 years ago, Yuki lived on a ranch on a remote island where the
Giant Warrior Pirates
celebrated. When the co-captains Dorry and Brogy were bragging about killing two enormous Sea Kings, she simply asked them both whose was bigger. This ended up starting an argument between the two, which then ended up leading to a fight which lasted for an entire century. It is unknown what happened to Yuki after that.
