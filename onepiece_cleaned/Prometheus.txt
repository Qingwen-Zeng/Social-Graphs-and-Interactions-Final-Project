Prometheus the Sun
is a sun
homie
that
Big Mom
summons from her right hand.
He is a special kind of homie, as he received a
soul fragment
from Big Mom herself,
and serves as one of her personal weapons alongside
Napoleon
and
Hera
, and formerly
Zeus
.
Appearance
[
]
Prometheus is a mass of compressed flames
with several sunrays surrounding him, giving him the appearance of an abstract drawing of the sun.
His eyes and nose are very close together, and are small compared to his large mouth. He has blushy, rosy cheeks and is usually seen with a toothy smile.
When he uses his power, his appearance changes, resembling a fireball while his facial features remain, though he can take on a more sinister appearance.
While sleeping, Prometheus does not exude any sun rays nor light, instead appearing a mere orb with a face floating in midair.
When he was initially described by
Pound
, he had a fierier appearance and was surrounded by fireballs rather than sunrays. His facial features consisted of only slanted, pupilless eyes and a mouth.
He took this appearance when joining with Big Mom to attack the
Thousand Sunny
.
Prometheus is very similar in appearance to his predecessor created by
Carmel
,
Pandora
, down to having a second more fireball-like appearance - though Prometheus lacks eyelashes, has a smaller face compared to his body, and tends to have forehead lines when smiling.
Personality
[
]
Prometheus is very loyal to
Big Mom
and will come to her when she summons him. He also cares about the safety of the citizens in
Totto Land
and may even question Big Mom and beg her to cease if he sees her tantrums are causing harm to others. However, due to being a homie, he can never physically go against Big Mom due to fearing her powerful soul as all homies do.
Loyal to Big Mom, Prometheus would not hesitate to execute any traitors in cold blood, as he brutally incinerated
Kingbaum
while callously causing heavy casualties among other homies nearby.
Prometheus has little faith in his fellow special homie Zeus, and repeatedly called him back and then scolded him when Zeus was lured into abandoning Big Mom to eat
Nami
's clouds.
Prometheus seems to overall think lowly of Zeus, considering him a useless deadweight that only serves to drag Big Mom down, and eventually convinced her
to replace him with a new thundercloud homie,
Hera
,
whom Prometheus wanted as a girlfriend, but to his chagrin, she rejected him. Prometheus showed no regret at Zeus being disposed of by Linlin and Hera.
Prior to fighting
Brook
, Prometheus had never been injured. Thus, when receiving a wound, he became very shocked and distressed at the pain.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Prometheus' intangibility.
Prometheus is far more powerful than normal
homies
, being made from a fragment of
Big Mom
's very own soul. This gives the sun a will strong enough to resist the soul projection of the
Yomi Yomi no Mi
's user.
However, Prometheus is still vulnerable to being injured by the user of the fruit.
Being made of fire, he is immune to almost all physical attacks, even ones imbued with
Armament Haki
(since he has no substantial body beneath his intangible effect), but can be harmed by water. However, due to his size, it will take a large quantity of water to just slow him down.
Prometheus can also be cut by the fire-cutting blade ability of
Foxfire Style
, and he expressed pain from the attack.
Prometheus and Zeus create a storm.
As a sun, Prometheus can fly, and is able to produce incredibly powerful flames and explosions, strong enough to harm
Vinsmoke Reiju
while she was wearing a flame-resistant
Raid Suit
.
When combining powers with
Zeus
, they can create incredibly vast and destructive thunderstorms.
Prometheus can also attack by growing in size to gigantic proportions, dwarfing even the enormous
Kingbaum
, and falling down on his opponents, burning everything in a large radius around him to cinders.
However, while Prometheus is in his gigantic size, he moves more sluggishly.
Though very powerful, Prometheus's flames can be overpowered by those generated by the user of the
Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Phoenix
, due to their special properties.
He has the ability to sense
Napoleon
's whereabouts.
Prometheus can also serve as Big Mom's mode of transportation, if Zeus is not available,
and can become a part of Big Mom's hair,
where he has the ability to burn anything he comes into contact with. Big Mom can also use Prometheus's flames to set Napoleon's blade alight in order to increase his attack power.
Similar to
Zeus
' lightning-eating habits, Prometheus needs to eat fire to regain his strength.

Then, by swinging Napoleon, Big Mom unleashes the energies in the form of a thin, highly concentrated beam that can pierce through flesh in an instant and culminates in a large explosion.

History
[

Past
[

witnessed the creation of the similar homie
Pandora
while in a hunger-induced daze, and subsequently stayed with its creator,
Mother Carmel
for some time after.
Prometheus and Zeus aiding a young Linlin in her pirating activities.
Sometime after Carmel's passing, Prometheus was created by a young Charlotte Linlin, and along with
Zeus
became one of her main weapons as she began her pirating career several decades ago. One such activity was the three of them raiding a kingdom for sweets.
Thirty-eight years ago, Prometheus was present during the
God Valley Incident
at Linlin's side.
During the Timeskip
[
]
When
Urouge
invaded
Totto Land
and defeated

sailed in to defeat Urouge.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Prometheus danced with Big Mom and many other
homies
as she asked for a status report on the preparations for
Sanji
and
Charlotte Pudding
's wedding.
During her rampage in
Sweet City
, Big Mom grabbed Prometheus and threw him onto the ground. Reappearing in the sky, the sun tried to tell Big Mom to stop, but she did not listen.
When
Monkey D. Luffy
invaded Whole Cake Island and defeated Cracker, Prometheus and Zeus created a massive storm while
Big Mom's army
marched to attack Luffy.
Big Mom uses Prometheus and Zeus to battle Brook.
Later, Big Mom broke into the Room of Treasure to deal with an intruder,
Brook
. She summoned Prometheus and Zeus to battle, and the three of them easily overwhelmed Brook.
Big Mom eventually captured Brook, and Prometheus bandaged a wound that he had received from the
Straw Hat member
, in shock that he had been injured for the first time.
Soon afterwards, Big Mom and her homies went to sleep, but Big Mom spotted a fly and swatted it. Thinking there was an intruder in the room, Prometheus, Zeus, and
Napoleon
woke up and attacked the spot where Big Mom swatted the fly before going back to sleep. Later, however,
Nami
entered the room, and Big Mom threw Prometheus at her, causing a fiery explosion.
On the morning of the wedding day, Big Mom was crying in grief when the skeleton she was carrying was not moving (not knowing that Brook had been replaced). Prometheus and Zeus cheered her up by reminding her of the wedding.
They later accompanied her to the wedding venue as the
Tea Party
began.
Big Mom attacks Jinbe with Prometheus.
When Luffy broke into the wedding venue, Big Mom summoned Prometheus and Zeus to her side in order to attack him. However,
Charlotte Katakuri
intercepted Luffy, and
Jinbe
entered the scene, formally leaving the Big Mom Pirates. When Big Mom found herself unable to remove Jinbe's lifespan like usual, she attacked him with Prometheus.
Later, when
Capone Bege
and his crew attempted to assassinate Big Mom and failed, she threw Prometheus at Bege and Caesar when they were trying to escape, catching
Vinsmoke Reiju
in the powerful blast.
Prometheus is stunned by Jinbe's water blasts.
After a craving Big Mom was told by
Perospero
that the Straw Hats had her desired wedding cake, Prometheus joined her as she chased after the Straw Hats while flying on Zeus. When Zeus became distracted by Nami's
thunderclouds
and dropped Big Mom to the ground, Prometheus angrily asked what he was doing. After
Kingbaum
chose to assist the Straw Hats in their escape, Prometheus berated him for his betrayal before growing to an enormous size and falling down on the tree homie, burning him.
The Straw Hats continued their escape, and Luffy tried attacking Prometheus, but was unable to hit the living flames. Jinbe managed to stun Prometheus by shooting bursts of water at him, though Prometheus quickly recovered and resumed chasing the Straw Hats. During the chase, however, Zeus unwittingly ate Nami's Weather Egg, filling him with storm energy. Nami then used Zeus to hit the Big Mom Pirates with a massive thunderbolt.
Once Zeus returned to normal size, Prometheus berated the cloud homie for his actions.
After Big Mom left Whole Cake Island to continue pursuing the Straw Hats, Prometheus was at the western coast with Zeus. Prometheus was exhausted and wanted to eat fire to recharge.
Prometheus expands to threaten the Thousand Sunny.
Later on, Prometheus and Zeus traveled over Totto Land's sea to reunite with Big Mom. They eventually returned to her, and they went to attack the Thousand Sunny, with Prometheus riding on top of Big Mom's head.
As Big Mom searched for the wedding cake she craved, Prometheus lit the sails on fire. Jinbe then stopped the flames by dousing the ship with a big sea current before knocking both Big Mom and Prometheus off the ship with Fish-Man Karate. They were quickly rescued by Zeus and Big Mom prepared for another assault. Brook bisected Zeus and Nami sent her thunderclouds in between the two halves of the cloud homie, causing Zeus to discharge his full power, engulfing Big Mom in a massive blast of electricity. However, Prometheus carried Big Mom, and she ordered him to chase after the Sunny.
During the chase, Prometheus grew into a gigantic size and threatened to torch the Sunny.
Prometheus stopped his attack when the Fire Tank Pirates arrived. Seeing the cake on Bege's ship, Prometheus then went after Bege and his crew.
While chasing the
Nostra Castello
, Prometheus was moving sluggishly due to his gigantic size.
After the Fire Tank Pirates changed course to
Funwari Island
, Prometheus began torching the Nostra Castello.
The Fire Tank Pirates managed to disembark on Funwari Island just as Prometheus destroyed their ship.
Levely Arc
[
]
Prometheus was with Big Mom in her chamber as she talked to
Kaidou
about their shared hatred toward Luffy and her plans for revenge.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Prometheus chases Nami, Carrot and Shinobu.
At
Onigashima
, Prometheus encountered Nami,
Carrot
, and
Shinobu
in the Pleasure Hall. Recognizing Nami as the one who took Zeus, the homie started calling for Big Mom.
After Big Mom captured Zeus, Nami, and Carrot, Prometheus went with her to the
Live Floor
.
When Big Mom later met with
Marco
, she brought out Prometheus to clash with him. However, the flames Marco generated in his
phoenix
transformation were powerful enough to overwhelm Prometheus. When
Carrot
and
Wanda
arrived, Big Mom rode Zeus and Prometheus away from the area.
Big Mom flew back into the Skull Dome
and up through the hole in the roof.
Prometheus fed on the fires burning on the roof and then listened as Big Mom and Kaidou talked.
Kid, Killer, Law,
Zoro
, and Luffy later arrived at the roof and confronted the two Emperors.
After Kaidou grazed Luffy, Big Mom tried attacking the Straw Hat captain with Prometheus, but Zoro stepped in and
cut
the sun homie in half. Prometheus later launched three balls of fire at Luffy, Kid, and Law.
During the fight, Prometheus was cut into pieces by Zoro, preventing him from helping Big Mom after she was pushed off the roof.
However, thanks to Kaidou's intervention, Prometheus was able to reassemble himself and flew down alongside Napoleon to catch Big Mom. When she called Zeus useless for not being able to help her, Prometheus agreed, saying that he was always holding them back, and asked Big Mom for a favor.
Prometheus then flew Big Mom back towards the rooftop, with Big Mom having heard his request and replaced Zeus with a new lightning homie,
Hera
. He went inside the Skull Dome with Big Mom to search for Kid, and when she encountered
Tama
and began happily talking to her, Prometheus remarked that it was Big Mom's "Mother Mode" acting up.
When Nami and Usopp, who were chased by Ulti and Page One, encountered Big Mom, Big Mom combined Prometheus with Hera and Napoleon to hit Ulti with
Maser Ho
. Following the turmoil, Prometheus was turned down by Hera to be his girlfriend, stating she only serves Big Mom and once again dismissed Zeus together with Napoleon after they encountered Zeus once more.
He joined Big Mom with his fellow homies as Big Mom prepared to fight both Kid and Law.
As the battle intensified, Big Mom tried to finish Kid off (who was weakened by Hawkin's
powers
, but was attacked by Law and seeing her being attacked, a furious Prometheus struck at Law with
Stollen Feuer
before returning to Big Mom's side.
He then turned massive in size to carry Big Mom as she sent Kid out of the floor, but was separated from Big Mom when Law used his awakened Devil Fruit Powers to hurt Big Mom's insides and Kid turned her into a magnet, burying both her and her three homies under the framework of Kaidou's castle.
Eventually, Big Mom broke free of the debris and turned the framework into homies by absorbing the souls of the nearby Beasts Pirates. After Big Mom used one year of her own life to grow massive in size, Prometheus, alongside Hera and Napoleon, grew massive in size as well, once again preparing to battle Kid and Law.
During the fight, Prometheus merged with Big Mom's hair.
