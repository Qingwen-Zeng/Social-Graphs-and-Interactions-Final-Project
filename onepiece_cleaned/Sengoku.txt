Sengoku the Buddha
is a former
Fleet Admiral
of the
Marines
,
succeeding
Kong
and preceding
Sakazuki
.
He retired from his leadership position after the
Summit War of Marineford
,
but remained in the Marines as an
Inspector General
.
He was also one of the major figures along with Kong,
Whitebeard
,
Shiki
,
Monkey D. Garp
,
Tsuru
, and
Silvers Rayleigh
during the times when
Gol D. Roger
, the "Pirate King", was still alive, and still continues to be in the present, even after his retirement from the Marines. He raised both
Donquixote Rosinante
and
X Drake
like his own sons.
Due to his actions and his position in the Marines, he is one of the three main antagonists of the
Marineford Arc
, alongside Sakazuki and
Marshall D. Teach
.
Appearance
[
]
Sengoku is a tall, fair-skinned, and muscular man with a long, braided goatee and a mustache. He is usually seen alongside his pet goat. His cap covers his hair, which is set in a large afro. His afro was revealed after using his Devil Fruit powers and having his cap knocked off. Ironically, prior to the timeskip, despite already being an elderly man upon his debut (being 77 years old at the time, thereby making him a year older than Garp and Rayleigh, both men being from his generation), Sengoku displayed little to no physical signs of his actual age, with his hair still not having grayed after 20 years.
He typically wears black-rimmed glasses and a white and gold full Marine admiral uniform that is adorned with medals. The most distinctive features of this uniform are a life-size seagull on top of his cap, and his oversized Marine coat which he wears like a cape. His coat has the kanji for justice, in blue, emblazoned on the back, and has unique colored cuffs, with his being white.
Twenty years before the present storyline, when Sengoku was already an Admiral, he did not cover his afro and sported only a mustache. During his orders to Saul to bombard Ohara, he wore less regal-looking attire than he does in the present storyline: a simple black tank top, blue jeans, and his glasses, which is unlike a typical Admiral's formal suit. The only Marine-related attire he wore at the time was apparently his Marine coat, draped over like a cape.
However, when he was fighting Shiki in Marineford, he was wearing a black double-breasted suit with a blue tie under his coat. Fourteen years ago, still as an Admiral, he is seen wearing a white suit with a floral button dress shirt underneath and begins to grow his trademark braided goatee, albeit much shorter than it is now.
His epaulettes during his time as an Admiral were similar to Garp's, which were red and black, but he doesn't have black on it, and he never used red epaulets ever since he became Fleet Admiral.
In his youth, he also did not cover his afro and he lacked a beard.
As a child, Sengoku had his trademark afro, and he was seen wearing a karate uniform with a black belt tied on his waist.
During the two-year timeskip, Sengoku aged with his hair turning gray, and has also grown sideburns. His former uniform is now replaced with a more casual wear during his retirement. He is wearing a dark blue shirt with red and green zig-zag patterns, orange tie with white marine shorts, and a Marine coat.

Personality
[
]
Sengoku appears to be an exceedingly proud, enlightened, and intelligent man who was loyal to the
World Government
and, up until the cover-up of the
Impel Down
incident, never questioned orders from them. He also will not accept any reason for letting a criminal go, and also has a habit of getting very irritated with failure. His motto is "Reigning Justice"
(
君臨する正義
,
Kunrinsuru Seigi
?
)
,
in that he prioritizes upholding justice over all things, although he certainly does not shy away from actions that fall under the code of
Absolute Justice
. From his view, the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
are just pirates,
though he notes how valuable they can be when the time comes. However, as the years went by, he appeared to be losing his faith in the government, shown after the
Summit War of Marineford
when he was furious at the order from the
Five Elders
to suppress the second escape incident in Level 6 of Impel Down to save face and keep the faith of the people, thus placing nations in danger. This eventually led Sengoku to resign from the Marines.
Before the Summit War, he was concerned over the movements of the
Straw Hat Pirates
, and had followed their actions ever since they departed from
Water 7
, though at the time his current concern was about the upcoming war against
Whitebeard
, to the point that he brushed off the incident of the attack on a
Celestial Dragon
and left it to the
Admirals
. Upon hearing about Luffy's break-in of
Impel Down
, Sengoku was so frustrated that he almost took it out on Garp,
and had come close to losing his patience with the antics of the Monkey family in general.
Sengoku also believed that a person's birth (with the consideration of the parents' reputation) is enough to determine the potential impact they could bring to the world if left unchecked, such as Ace being Roger's son
and Luffy being Dragon's son. This is shown at Ace's execution, where one of the main reasons for Ace's execution was not just because he was a pirate, but because he was the son of
Gol D. Roger
, and Sengoku believed that Ace must be eliminated by any means necessary, even if that meant an all-out war with Whitebeard.
His epithet, Sengoku the Buddha, may seem contradictory at best since throughout the course of the series, while he has shown himself to be an extremely calm, composed, collected man, he has also shown himself to be quite capable of anger and violence.
Doflamingo
remarked on this irony when the Seven Warlords of the Sea convened at Mary Geoise to choose a successor for Crocodile.
However, with the revelation of his Devil Fruit power, it would seem his epithet's origins come from his fruit's ability, exactly like the three current admirals (although his is not an alias).
He also appears to have some common sense, as shown when he ordered the Summit War to be put to an end and ordered the other Marines to tend to the wounded, in doing so he avoided further casualties and a potential conflict with the
Red Hair Pirates
. His
justice
is not as uncompromising as
Akainu
's, and it seems to be more of a mix of both absolute and moral justice, as he did hold a large speech about morality. Another hint of moral justice is also shown when he got infuriated when the
World Government
decided to cover up the mass escape of the Level 6
Impel Down
prisoners released by Blackbeard, although he once said not to question the World Government's orders.
In addition, in his conversation with
Kong
, he stated that
justice
is a matter of personal values and does not endorse one form of justice over the other, mirroring
Smoker
's talk with
Tashigi
in
Arabasta
. This insinuates that Sengoku is more of a pragmatist in applying justice.
Caesar Clown
also states Sengoku is too soft for rejecting the potential of mass-murder weapons and experimentation on prisoners, in contrast to what Caesar believes
Sakazuki
would want,
further enforcing that Sengoku is more moral than he appears.
After becoming an Inspector General, Sengoku seems to have become far more cheerful and laid-back and tends to take things very casually like his friend Garp, such as how he merely laughed playfully when Fujitora voiced his thoughts in how Law and Luffy should be acknowledged as Dressrosa's heroes, along with the Admiral's decision to not arrest the pirate alliance immediately. Tsuru notes this drastic change in Sengoku's behavior is the result of how he has less responsibilities as compared to his time in the past.
Regardless, he still shows wisdom as he passed down his knowledge to the current generation of Marines about the past regarding the Four Emperors and pointed out how many world known figures have some affiliation with Wano.
Sengoku weeping inconsolably at the news of Rosinante's death.
Though he may appear to be stern because of his duties as a Marine, he is actually very kind and compassionate. His drastic actions at the
Summit War of Marineford
were motivated by the desire to protect innocent civilians from getting embroiled in conflict out of fear that when the secrets held in
One Piece
are discovered, it would turn the world on its head and lead to total war. He also expressed extreme rage towards the World Government for trying to cover up the breakout of extremely dangerous criminals imprisoned in Level Six of Impel Down, as letting such criminals loose could pose immense danger to civilians. Furthermore, learning about
Donquixote Rosinante
's death, a man he considered like his own son, was enough to break his heart and drive him to tears.
After the death of
T Bone
, Sengoku retained his serious demeanor when necessary, in spite of his laziness. He showed concerned for the civilians and how they attacked the Marines due to the influences of
Cross Guild
.
Like his longtime colleague Garp, Sengoku's favorite snack is
okaki
, fried rice crackers. He is often seen munching on them, especially in his retirement. Like Issho, Sengoku's second favorite snack is a Soba Noodles.
Relationships
[
]
Marines
[
]
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
Sengoku's annoyance at Garp.
Monkey D. Garp
is a lifetime colleague of Sengoku's, having occasionally accompanied him on his assignments when he was still an Admiral, and even then, Sengoku found him irritating.
As Garp is considered a "Hero of the Marines", Sengoku respects him greatly. However, their relationship was tested after discovering that Garp withheld the information that the infamous
Monkey D. Luffy
is his grandson, which left the Fleet Admiral furious at Garp. This, added to the frustration caused by Luffy's repeated actions against the World Government, caused Sengoku to start losing patience with Garp and he made it clear he would have forced him to take responsibility if it were not for his position as the Hero of the Marines. Garp, on the other hand, took the development happily, much to Sengoku's frustration.
Sengoku had somehow found out that Garp had adopted
Portgas D. Ace
, the son of Pirate King
Gol D. Roger
, which was meant to be kept secret from the
World Government
. Sengoku warned Garp not to do anything foolish regarding Ace's execution, or there would be no mercy.
Sengoku also knows that the
Revolutionary
known as
Dragon
is Luffy's father, and by extension Garp's son. It is unknown as to how long Sengoku knew about all this, or when he first learned about this, or how it would affect Garp's standing in the Marines. However, Sengoku had no problem in revealing everything to the entire world.
When Garp allows Luffy to pass him, Sengoku was displeased, saying that Garp was in the end "still a grandfather". When Garp stood up after being hit by Luffy, he asked him whether he was alright, showing some concern. Sengoku is also quick to restrain Garp if he tries to do anything foolish, as shown when Sengoku pinned Garp to the ground when he later tried to go after Akainu for killing Ace.
Despite being Garp's superior officer, Sengoku nonetheless carries a great deal of respect and still considers him to be an important friend and ally.
After the Summit War, both Sengoku and Garp retired from their position but their records remained intact. Sengoku asked Hina of Garp's whereabouts since the new flavor Rice Crackers came out only to learned that he and SWORD have sailed to Hachinosu to rescue Koby.
Tsuru
[
]
Sengoku appears to be well-acquainted with Vice Admiral
Tsuru
as well. Thirteen years ago, in the
North Blue
, she worked under Sengoku's orders to stop the Donquixote Pirates. Despite being outranked by him, Tsuru still had no problem calling him a fool for providing her wrong intel.
Nowadays, Tsuru appears to be annoyed with Sengoku's new cheerful disposition and lack of responsibility that is almost similar to Garp.
Kuzan
[
]
Sengoku seems to show great respect for the former
Admiral
and appreciates his view on justice as well as his potential for leadership. This was proven when he personally nominated
Kuzan
to replace him in the position of Fleet Admiral, when he decided to step down himself.
Issho
[
]
Sengoku seems to show respect for the newly promoted
Admiral
and respects his view on justice. He does not berate
Issho
for his choice to expose the abuse of the Warlord of the Sea position by
Donquixote Doflamingo
to the general public. Despite this, the former
Fleet Admiral
does lightly suggest that Issho apologize to
Sakazuki
to mitigate the punishment he received for his refusal to suppress the Government's decision to permit the Heavenly Demon to usurp the Dressrosa throne.
Sakazuki
[
]
Sengoku seems to be casual with his successor to the position of Fleet Admiral. He is amused when Issho uses a loophole to attend the Levely and comments to Akainu on how difficult it is to lead the Marines. When Sakazuki interrupted his meeting with the young Marines, Sengoku is not bothered at all and talked to his successor about
Kouzuki Oden
.
Donquixote Rosinante
[
]
Sengoku's first meeting with Rosinante.
Despite being the last remaining relative of the pirate and future Warlord of the Sea
Donquixote Doflamingo
, Sengoku had great trust in
Rosinante
, as Doflamingo was unknowingly being monitored by his younger brother. When Rosinante was 8 years old, Sengoku took him under his wing and later helped him become a Marine.
It was implied that Sengoku was responsible for Corazon's façade of hating kids, in a ploy to discourage children from being drawn to and staying with the
Donquixote Pirates
.
Sengoku always saw Rosinante as a son and was devastated when his death was reported. Because of this, and with Rosinante lying to Sengoku just once regarding to the
Minion Island
incident, Sengoku would later converse with
Trafalgar Law
to confirm how and why Rosinante died and was able to get some closure upon learning the circumstances.
X Drake
[
]
After he fled his father's crew Sengoku took in Drake and treated him like his son.
World Government
[
]
Twenty-two years ago, Sengoku was shown to be loyal to the World Government and did not like anyone questioning them. However, he has now lost his trust in them, especially the
Five Elders
, concerning the suppression of the Impel Down incident. This was proven by showing how angry he was at the government's decision not to issue bounties on the many criminals who had escaped from Level 6 of Impel Down. This is also shown by his outburst at their decision to keep quiet about the breakout, even though any one of the escapees could potentially destroy a country. This was one of, if not the biggest reason, for his retirement from the Marines.
Enemies
[
]
Edward Newgate
[
]
As Sengoku was a major figure back in
Gol D. Roger
's time, and still is today, he is one of the few enemies
Whitebeard
respects. Sengoku, along with the entire Marines and World Government, waged war against Whitebeard over the life of
Portgas D. Ace
before the latter's death. With the Marines' victory, Sengoku respected Shanks' wish to relinquish the bodies of Whitebeard and Ace for a proper burial, as opposed to showing them on the televised broadcast as trophies. By Shanks' admission, the Fleet Admiral respected the old pirate. In his meeting with
Kong
, Sengoku acknowledged Whitebeard to be the greatest of all legendary pirates.
Marshall D. Teach
[
]
Sengoku shows a great deal of hatred towards
Blackbeard
for a number of reasons. These reasons include abandoning his post in Marineford, stealing a warship, infiltrating Impel Down, recruiting a number of extremely dangerous prisoners into his crew, abusing his position in the Seven Warlords of the Sea and later resigning from it, obtaining the power of the
Gura Gura no Mi
, and attempting to completely destroy Marineford.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Before resigning from the Marines, Sengoku was angry with
Luffy
's actions such as defeating Warlord of the Sea
Crocodile
, invading
Enies Lobby
and defeating
Rob Lucci
of the
CP9
, defeating Warlord of the Sea
Gecko Moria
, punching
World Noble
Saint
Charlos
, breaking into and out of
Impel Down
, and intruding on the war against Whitebeard in an attempt to rescue Ace. Coupled with the fact that each action deals a devastating blow to the World Government and that he is also
Vice Admiral
Garp
's grandson, Sengoku tended to take the frustration he felt after one of Luffy's stunts out on Garp. Sengoku also knows that Dragon is Luffy's biological father and considered the young pirate to be a great threat to the world due to his heritage, which is exactly the same way he felt about Ace.
After the timeskip, he seems to no longer show any animosity towards Luffy, as he did not reprimand Issho for letting Luffy and Law escape Dressrosa.
Shanks
[
]
Despite
Shanks
being a pirate, which would make him an enemy, Sengoku appears to have some respect towards him, stating that because of his words, he would officially end the war with the Whitebeard Pirates as well as hand over Ace and Whitebeard's bodies to the
Red Hair Pirates
to be given a proper burial. This is the first time Sengoku has shown respect towards a pirate, whereas he would not show respect even towards the Seven Warlords of the Sea.
Shiki
[
]
Sengoku seemed to view
Shiki
as his main enemy twenty years ago in the same sense that Garp viewed Gol D. Roger. He warned Garp that Shiki was his to capture and was annoyed when Garp said he would give him the credit, showing Sengoku felt the need to capture Shiki himself and wasn't merely after fame. Although he was willing to fight Shiki with Garp when he attacked Marineford, this could be to limit the damage Shiki could cause seeing as he destroyed half of Marineford when fighting both of them.
Trafalgar D. Water Law
[
]
Despite being on opposite sides of the law, they both cared for the same person, Donquixote Rosinante, and currently honor his memory in their own different ways. Sengoku told
Law
that he should live because Rosinante sacrificed himself for the pirate. Perhaps because of Rosinante's actions, Sengoku decided to let Law leave Dressrosa, under the claim that he (Sengoku) is no longer a field officer, and therefore not obligated to arrest the renegade warlord.
Sengoku was surprised to discover that Law was a
D
, but apparently claimed that he knew nothing about the unique meaning of the letter.
Jack
[
]
As the Marines transferred
Doflamingo
toward
Impel Down
,
Jack
attempted to rescue him at any costs. Sengoku's reputation was not enough for Jack to take back Doflamingo by force.
Seven Warlords of the Sea
[
]
As with
Vice Admiral
Smoker
and
Admiral
Kizaru
, Sengoku believes that the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
are no more than pirates, and therefore, trusts them very little, made clear when he called them "
scum of the sea
". However, he sees them as being very useful in times of need. When these World Government allies refuse to live up to their duties, such as
Boa Hancock
,
Jinbe
, and
Marshall D. Teach
did, Sengoku shows his resentment. Surprisingly, despite being informed about the exposure of
Donquixote Doflamingo
's criminal enterprises on Dressrosa, he does not seem enraged and casually discusses the fiasco (although this was when Sengoku is semi-retired and was no longer as responsible).
Others
[
]
Kong
[
]
Sengoku and
Kong
are acquainted with each other even after Kong become the Commander-in-Chief for the World Government. Sengoku once worked under him when Kong was Fleet Admiral during Roger's time. After the Marineford War, Kong reassigned Sengoku as Inspector General after he succeeded in persuading Sengoku to stay in the Marines.

Sengoku and
Z
were once friends until Z resigned from the Marines after the World Government allied with
pirates
. Sengoku stood silently for his former friend even after his attempting to destroy the new world.
Concludes non-canon section.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the former
Fleet Admiral
of the entire Marine force, Sengoku had absolute power over every action the Marines do, including summoning a
Buster Call
, granting and removing a
Warlord
's title at any time, provided they meet the criteria for either. The only ones that are above him are
Imu
(in secret), the
Five Elders
, and Commander-in-Chief
Kong
. However, with his resignation, came the loss of such authorities.
Alongside
Garp
, Sengoku is one of the most powerful Marines of his generation. Both
Gol D. Roger
and
Whitebeard
held high regard for him. After defeating a group of Marines, Roger commented that he was one of the two Marines that were worth his time, the other being Garp.
When
Shiki
was wreaking havoc in Marineford twenty-four years ago, Sengoku fought alongside Garp and were able to subdue him whilst destroying half the city in the process, keeping him imprisoned in
Impel Down
, a tremendous feat as Shiki is an immensely powerful swordsman who had single-handedly slaughtered an entire army of Marines before they subjugated him.
Even at 79 years old, Sengoku could, alongside
Fujitora
and
Tsuru
, defeat
Jack
, one of the top-ranking, strongest members of the
Beasts Pirates
under the Emperor
Kaidou
.
Tactical Skills
[
]
An extraordinary master strategist with immense military experience, Sengoku is renowned for his tactical and strategic genius by Marines and pirates alike. He is mainly responsible for all the Marine maneuvers deployed throughout the Whitebeard War at Marineford, such as forwarding a plan to all Marines that
Portgas D. Ace
was to be executed ahead of the official schedule with the intention that the opposing pirate forces would intercept the message and lose their composure. He then conspired with Admiral
Akainu
in a plot to derail the alliance between Whitebeard's core divisions and the 41 independent New World pirate crews assisting by directing a 20-strong Pacifista division to target only the non-Whitebeard division pirates, and it was possible that the earlier transmissions regarding Ace's true parentage was not only an act of public justification but also to demoralize those pirates who were undermined by the Roger Pirates. With Akainu's persuasion, Sengoku's plan managed to drive one of those captains to attempt assassinating Whitebeard himself, and while the blow was not fatal, it did further debilitate Whitebeard's already hazardous condition.
He operated his strategies while keeping close in mind the various powers of his greatest subordinates, especially the Marine Admirals: raising Marineford's siege walls in conjunction with Akainu's "Ryusei Kazan" to rout the allied pirate forces and destroying Whitebeard's flagship, the
Moby Dick
while protecting the brunt of the Marine garrison from the damage.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Even without his Zoan Devil Fruit powers, Sengoku has enormous strength, enough to effortlessly hold down an enraged Garp with only one hand. Sengoku is also a tremendously skilled hand-to-hand fighter. Combined with his Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit powers, he could knock away all the members of the
Blackbeard Pirates
, who are extremely powerful in their own right, sending them flying.
Sengoku has extraordinary speed, even in his gigantic buddha form. He could launch an unexpected surprise attack on all the members of the Blackbeard Pirates.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Daibutsu
Sengoku transforms with his Devil Fruit.
Sengoku ate the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Daibutsu, a
Mythical Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a
giant golden Buddha
and a human-Buddha hybrid at will. This power is the source of his nickname, "Sengoku the Buddha". A number of Marines claimed that they have never seen him use this power before the war.
As a Zoan, Sengoku gains an immense boost to his already impressive physical abilities while in his Buddha form. With only a single indirectly connecting punch, Sengoku was able to make the Marineford execution platform collapse, despite the punch being cushioned and blocked by Luffy's
Gear 3 inflated belly
and Mr. 3's "stronger than steel"
Candle Wall
.
He can also release an exceptionally powerful golden shockwave with a palm thrust, it is strong enough to send a majority of the incredibly strong Blackbeard Pirates, consisting of some of the most dangerous criminals in history, flying a fair distance away. In the anime, his golden shockwaves are strong enough to clash evenly with the tremor shockwaves created by the
Gura Gura no Mi
of
Blackbeard
.
Haki

Past

Early life
[

Not much is known about Sengoku's early life, other than he is originally from the
South Blue
and joined the
Marines
56 years ago along with
Monkey D. Garp
and
Tsuru
, at the age of 23.
Over the years, Sengoku rose up through the ranks of the Marines, eventually achieving the rank of
Admiral
at some point before the Great Age of Pirates.
Thirty-one years ago, Sengoku met an 8-year-old
Donquixote Rosinante
, who was grieving the death of his father at the hands of his older brother
Doflamingo
. Sengoku took the boy under his wing, coming to see him as a son. Rosinante eventually joined the Marines.
Encounter with Shiki the Golden Lion
[
]
Sengoku and
Garp
fight
Shiki
.
Twenty-seven years before the current storyline, the Marines were alerted to
a confrontation
between
Shiki
and
Gol D. Roger
, and the then-Admiral Sengoku, Garp, and several other high-ranking Marines were sent on a mission to contain it. Before they could make it, a storm occurred, and half of Shiki's fleet was sunk during the battle. Three years later, Roger turned himself over to the Marines, and his execution was announced across the world. A week before Roger's execution, Shiki attacked
Marineford
, demanding that he be allowed to kill Roger. Sengoku and Garp intervened and fought him together. After a fierce battle that destroyed half of Marineford, they managed to defeat Shiki, and he was imprisoned in
Impel Down
.
Ohara Incident
[
]
Twenty-two years before the current storyline, Sengoku received orders from the
World Government
to carry out a secret mission. This mission was to send a
Buster Call
to obliterate
Ohara
. With these orders, Sengoku gave the
Golden Den Den Mushi
for the operation to
CP9
director who was to investigate the situation,
Spandine
.
Among the five
Vice Admirals
Sengoku chose to lead the Buster Call were
Sakazuki
,
Kuzan
, and
Jaguar D. Saul
.
Admiral Sengoku telling Saul of his mission to
Ohara
.
Following the arrest of
Nico Olvia
, Sengoku notified Saul of his role in the upcoming mission. The
giant
protested against this and tried to reason with Sengoku that the Oharans were merely scholars interested only in history. Sengoku, however, ignored his protests and told Saul to just follow orders. Later, Sengoku received news that Saul had liberated Olvia from her imprisonment. Seeing that the Buster Call mission to Ohara was in jeopardy, Sengoku ordered his subordinates to quickly find the two before the operation could be stopped.
After the operation had finished, Sengoku was informed by Spandine that one of the scholars of Ohara had escaped from the Buster Call attack. This little girl,
Nico Robin
, was deemed a threat. With that in mind, Sengoku and other high-ranking officials put up a
bounty
of
79,000,000 on her in order to help catch her.
Pursuit of the Donquixote Pirates
[
]
After Rosinante enlisted into the Marines and rose to the rank of commander, Sengoku assigned him with a mission to spy on the
Donquixote Pirates
, led by Rosinante's elder brother
Donquixote Doflamingo
, and to make sure that children do not get involved with the pirate crew. Fourteen years before the current storyline, Rosinante contacted Sengoku and asked for permission to put his mission on hold, which Sengoku granted. He then accepted a request from
Vergo
to transfer to the
G-5
base, noting the progress he had made in the one year since he had joined the Marines.
Six months after Rosinante left the Donquixote Pirates, Sengoku contacted him again and was surprised that he was informed of the
Ope Ope no Mi
from his brother. Sengoku then informed Rosinante of a trade that was going to occur on
Rubeck Island
in three weeks and Rosinante informed the admiral of Doflamingo's plans to steal the
Ope Ope no Mi
and that the crew would be on
Swallow Island
three days before the exchange. Sengoku then made plans to ambush the Donquixote Pirates on Swallow Island and warned Rosinante not to go anywhere near there.
After discovering Rosinante's death, Sengoku grieved.
At some point afterwards Sengoku meet
X Drake
, who fled from his father's crew during the incident, and took him in, eventually seeing him as a son, just like Rosinante previously.
Sometimes afterwards, Sengoku rose to the rank of
Fleet Admiral
.

After
Crocodile
had been defeated by
Monkey D. Luffy
and stripped of his rank as a
Warlord of the Sea
, Sengoku was called in to discuss Crocodile's replacement in
Mary Geoise
, along with the various Marine officers attending there and whoever among the Seven Warlords of the Sea decided to show up. He showed up late and caught Doflamingo
messing around
with some of the Marine officials attending the meeting. Seeing the pirate's actions, he told him to stop immediately. With that settled, he apologized for being late, greeted everyone, and started the meeting.
The meeting in Mary Geoise.
While Sengoku discussed some further formalities with Doflamingo, he and the others were shocked by
Dracule Mihawk
's sudden appearance in the meeting. Sengoku and everyone else were then later interrupted by the appearance of
Laffitte
, who had somehow snuck into the meeting room. As Sengoku was told of the identity of this newcomer, Laffitte suggested a perfect candidate to replace Crocodile,
Marshall D. Teach
. Having never heard of Teach before, Sengoku told Laffitte that an unknown pirate without a reputation would not be much use as a Warlord of the Sea. Laffitte, however, told Sengoku that he and the rest of his crew already had a plan to make Teach famous. With that, Laffitte left Sengoku and the other people attending the meeting and told them to remember his crew's name, the
Blackbeard Pirates
.

and return with Luffy's head as proof of completion, revealing himself as the one who placed the termination order for the pirate crew. He also voiced concern about their increasing proximity to
Marine Headquarters
and commented on how Luffy tended to get into one troublesome incident after another. Garp also annoyed him when he talked about tea and crackers instead of showing concern over his grandson's progress.

Sengoku during Shiki's attack on Marineford.
When
Shiki
returned from his 20-year disappearance, he attacked Marineford using his powers to levitate and hurl fleets of ships at the island as a warning to the Marines. Sengoku was surprised he was still alive after all this time. After Shiki's surprising defeat at the hands of Luffy days later, Sengoku lamented on how the Marines were useless and they had been saved by pirates.

Sabaody Archipelago Arc

Sengoku was greatly irritated by Luffy's attack on
World Noble
Saint
Charlos
and for "taking hostage"
his father
and
sister
. Seeing this, Admiral
Kizaru
offered to go to
Sabaody Archipelago
himself to handle the problem with Sengoku's permission.
Amazon Lily Arc
[
]
At Marine Headquarters, Sengoku received the report that Vice Admiral
Momonga
had managed to "convince" Pirate Empress
Boa Hancock
to follow up on the mandatory summons of the government. Sengoku was pleased by this as he acknowledged Hancock's strength but was also troubled that
Jinbe
refused to cooperate with them and was prepared to lose his status, fighting the Marines instead of
Whitebeard
.
Afterwards, an official told him of the number of pirates that Admiral Kizaru managed to capture at Sabaody and at least five hundred pirates were to be sent to
Impel Down
. Sengoku was irritated for being bothered for such a reason and asked to be informed only of matters relating to Whitebeard. In the same manner, he brushed off the matter of the incident with Saint Charlos, saying it was a matter for the admirals. He then asked where Garp was and was annoyed upon learning that he left for Impel Down a while ago. He then received news that Whitebeard's main ship, the
Moby Dick
, was on the move and that all twenty-three patrol ships were decimated. He ordered extreme caution even at Impel Down.
Impel Down Arc
[
]
Sengoku blaming Garp for Luffy's actions in Impel Down.
To Sengoku's great displeasure, he received information that Luffy had broken into Impel Down and, putting the dots together, Sengoku correctly deduced that Luffy's invasion within the great prison itself was to rescue
Portgas D. Ace
from execution in the critical time when they were supposed to be preparing for war against Whitebeard. Garp, however, found it amusing that his grandson would go to such lengths simply to rescue Ace. Sengoku angrily told Garp that no one had attempted anything so atrocious in the history of Impel Down, since twenty-two years prior to current events, and was annoyed that the one who would do it was Garp's grandson.
Sengoku also said to Garp that had he not been the "Hero of the Marines", he would have held Garp personally responsible for his family's actions. Garp simply replied that the life of an old man would not atone for Luffy's transgressions.
When Blackbeard stole a Marine ship with his crew and broke into Impel Down, Sengoku looked distraught at the news.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Sengoku reveals who Ace's father is.
Three hours prior to Ace's execution, Sengoku told Garp that he would reveal Ace's origins to the world,
which Garp allowed. Sengoku then revealed to his subordinates that Ace's father was none other than Gol D. Roger, the Pirate King. He later witnessed the arrival of Whitebeard and
his allies
. According to Whitebeard, they had not seen each other in decades. When Whitebeard began his attack, Sengoku stated that Whitebeard ate the
Gura Gura no Mi
and that he had the power to destroy the world.
Following several attacks from both sides, he proclaimed that the war had begun.
Even though pirates had breached the outer defenses. Sengoku was unbothered by the news and continued with his plan to execute Ace before the scheduled 3:00 p.m. When Garp sat on the execution platform and was torn between family and duty, Sengoku warned him not to do anything foolish or he would suffer the consequences.
Luffy's unceremonious self-introduction into the
Summit War of Marineford
had Sengoku apoplectic, going so far as screaming at Garp for having his family intruding in the World Government's affairs again. Sengoku only got angrier when Jinbe loudly declared his resignation from the Warlord of the Sea title. When asked by Kizaru if executions were in order for each and every last one of the Impel Down escapees, Sengoku wholeheartedly agreed and gave the order to attack.
When Luffy declared that he was Ace's brother, which brought the question of how Roger can have a second son after he died before Ace's birth and Rouge dying shortly after the birth, Sengoku revealed to the world that Luffy was not only Ace's adoptive brother but is also
Revolutionary
Dragon
's son, making Luffy another dangerous future element.
When Whitebeard split his forces rather than focusing them all in the bay, Sengoku realized that Whitebeard had sensed the Fleet Admiral's ruse but believed that the Emperor's intuition would not be enough to save him.
Meanwhile, Sengoku had ordered Akainu to deceive
Squard
, one of Whitebeard's allies, telling him that Whitebeard had sold out every one of his allies to the Marines.
Once their preparations were complete, Sengoku gave the order to cut the video broadcasting as an army of
Pacifista
—lead by
Sentomaru
—appeared at the mouth of the bay.
Even though the pirates were not all in the bay as planned, Sengoku still ordered the Pacifistas to attack the rear and also ordered the withdrawal of Marines off of the ice and into the plaza. Once the broadcast was ended, the Marines planned to raise the siege wall and execute Ace. However,
Buggy
had stolen one of the
Visual Den Den Mushi
to broadcast his own fame as a member of the
Roger Pirates
, so Sengoku had to delay Ace's execution and ordered the Marines to shoot down Buggy and his crew.
As part of the plan to deceive Squard, the Pacifistas attacked all non-Marines in the bay except members of the Whitebeard Pirates, and because of his hatred towards Roger (and by extension, his son Ace), Squard believed Akainu's words and attacked Whitebeard, stabbing him in the chest. Everything went according to Sengoku's plans, except for the fact that the whole world had seen everything happening thanks to Buggy's Den Den Mushi. In order to prevent him from broadcasting any more of the battle, Sengoku ordered Aokiji to
freeze
him, the Den Den Mushi, and the Impel Down prisoners with him.
When Whitebeard himself entered the battle and quaked the whole island, Sengoku ordered the raising of the siege wall; however,
Little Oars Jr.
's unconscious body held down a section. Sengoku then ordered Akainu to melt the ice underneath the pirates.
Sengoku flinched when one of Whitebeard's shockwaves slammed against the wall but was unable to break it. His order to commence Ace's execution spurred Luffy into hurtling himself over the siege wall and landing in front of the execution platform, at which Sengoku grimaced.
Sengoku then ordered for Ace's execution, but the executioners were attacked by Crocodile, much to Sengoku's surprise.
Sengoku prepares to fight.
After Oars Jr. had helped breach the siege wall with the newly revealed ship, which allowed the Whitebeard Pirates access into the main plaza, Sengoku stated that he would not be able to sit and watch anymore. He rolled up his sleeves and assumed that he would soon go into battle himself.
When
Marco
flew
at the execution platform, Garp, without an order from Sengoku, moved from his spot and punched the Whitebeard Commander.
Sengoku watched as Ace was moved to tears by the sacrifice everyone was willing to make for him.
After Marco and
Jozu
were grievously injured, Sengoku ordered the Marines to focus on Whitebeard, but the Emperor refused to die until he could secure a future for his "children". Telling Whitebeard to see their future as it was, Sengoku ordered for another pair of executioners to proceed with executing Ace. Luffy then unleashed a wave of
Supreme King Haki
, which knocked out the executioners. Sengoku was shocked at this sudden burst of Haki.
Sengoku strikes an inflated Luffy.
When Luffy, thanks to
Inazuma
's
powers
, managed to reach the execution platform,
Sengoku complained about Garp hesitating and letting his grandson pass through him, declaring that even he was a father. Then, when Luffy tried to free his brother, Sengoku angrily transformed into
his giant form
, declaring he would carry out the execution himself. As Sengoku attacked Luffy, the latter activated
Gear 3
, which surprised Sengoku, seeing that Luffy's body size increased. Sengoku's attack was stopped by Luffy's Gigant Fusen, supplemented by
Mr. 3
's
Candle Wall defense
. The execution platform was destroyed by Sengoku's massive punch and the fleet admiral fell to the ground with the pirates.
After Ace had been freed, Sengoku was ashamed of himself for allowing Ace to escape in his presence. As Whitebeard was reducing Marineford to ruins,
Sengoku told his men that Whitebeard was the threat for the moment.
Sengoku pins Garp down.
After Akainu had killed Ace, an enraged Garp expressed a desire to kill the admiral in revenge. To prevent him from acting on this desire, Sengoku pinned Garp down to the ground, calling him a fool.
When Akainu blasted off a portion of Whitebeard's head, Whitebeard still continued to shatter the Marine Headquarters, and Sengoku was shocked that the great pirate could still have so much power.
Sengoku's shock became mixed with fury when the
Blackbeard Pirates
arrived on the battlefield, with many legendary prisoners from Impel Down standing on the execution scaffold. Sengoku's fury only intensified when he learned that Blackbeard only wanted the Warlord of the Sea title to break into Impel Down to recruit those prisoners and that he had discarded the title.
When Whitebeard was saying his last words about the
Will of D.
, Sengoku showed great fear and was furious with Whitebeard because he revealed to the entire world that
One Piece
truly existed. After Whitebeard had taken his final breath, Sengoku witnessed Blackbeard and Whitebeard disappearing under a black cloth, and later Blackbeard coming out of it after somehow stealing the powers of the Gura Gura no Mi from his former captain and using them to attack the already crumbling Marineford.
Sengoku attacking the Blackbeard Pirates.
When Blackbeard declared that this age was his and intended to start it off by sinking Marineford, Sengoku transformed into his Buddha form and delivered a powerful shockwave to the Blackbeard Pirates, sending the whole crew flying. He then warned Blackbeard not to go around spouting nonsense such as sinking the mighty fortress which represents
justice
and prepared to fight to defend the pride of the Marines.
Blackbeard taunted Sengoku and Garp, stating he would end their age just like he ended Whitebeard's.
The battle came to a halt by
Koby
's screaming for everyone to stop. Sengoku had listened to the young Marine's speech before he witnessed the arrival of
Shanks
, who stopped Akainu from killing Koby and stated to be in Marineford to end the war. After a short conversation with Shanks, Sengoku allowed him to take the bodies of Ace and Whitebeard, saying that he would take full responsibility for letting all the pirates on the battlefield go. He then told the Marines to tend to the wounded and that the war was over.
Post-War Arc
[

Sengoku resting after the battle.
Sitting on a pile of rubble during the war's aftermath and covered in bandages from the injuries he had sustained at some point during the war, Sengoku was informed by
Brannew
about
Magellan
's critical condition. Sengoku forbade Magellan from leaving his medical care to take responsibility for the mass breakouts or to commit suicide for his failure. He was also told about the situation in Impel Down Level 6, in which there were Level 6 prisoners missing from the prison other than the four Blackbeard took, despite Blackbeard ordering them to massacre each other and that he would take the winners as his new recruits.
This led Sengoku to suspect that other Level 6 prisoners had also escaped. Sengoku told Brannew to distribute wanted posters immediately, as even one Level 6 prisoner getting into a nation could cause major casualties to its citizens. However, Brannew informed the fleet admiral that the World Government was trying to keep this breakout quiet in order to save face and to keep the faith of the people. This level of suppression greatly infuriated Sengoku.
Sengoku meets Kong and resigns.
Two weeks after the war, Sengoku approached Commander-in-Chief
Kong
, requesting resignation from his position as fleet admiral. Kong, though somewhat disappointed at this, accepted Sengoku's decision but assured him that both his and Garp's (who resigned earlier) records would remain untouched as an influential way of recruiting new Marines. Before departing, Sengoku suggested that Aokiji replace him as the next Marine fleet admiral.

Fujitora
's argument with Fleet Admiral Sakazuki and expressed how happy he was to not be Fleet Admiral anymore. They then met up with Admiral Fujitora and Sengoku laughed playfully at how Fujitora used a dice to determine his decision to not capture Luffy and Law.

D.
" and asked Sengoku about it. Sengoku was surprised at the revelation but did not answer the question. Sengoku then told Law to live his life as Rosinante wanted. Their conversation ended when Issho used his gravity ability to lift all the rubble in Dressrosa in preparation to strike Luffy's allies at the eastern port.
After Fujitora had allowed Luffy and his allies to escape, Sengoku appeared behind him, saying that he heard him thanking Luffy.
After leaving Dressrosa, Sengoku and the Marines escorted Doflamingo. Sengoku asked Issho to apologize to Sakazuki, but he refused, saying that he still has his pride. Sometime later, a subordinate of

Though he sank two of the Marine ships, Jack was ultimately defeated.
