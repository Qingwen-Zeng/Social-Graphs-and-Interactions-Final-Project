Gonbe
is known as
Chimney
's
pet
cat, although he is actually a rabbit.
Appearance
[
]
Gonbe thinks he is a cat but obviously has the body of a rabbit, including long ears and a cotton-tail. He is mostly light blue with a cream-colored face and front. Like his master, he constantly has a wide grin on his face.
After the timeskip, Gonbe seems to have grown somewhat bigger and looks a bit more like a normal rabbit.
Personality
[
]
Gonbe is never seen away from Chimney's side: he goes wherever she goes, often mimicking her actions. He is rarely seen without a broad smile. He is convinced that he is a cat and even makes the sound of one ("nya"; Japanese equivalent of "meow").
