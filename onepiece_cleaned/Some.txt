O-Some
is a geisha who works in
Wano Country
's
Flower Capital
.
Appearance
[
]
Some is a young woman of average size with wavy light-colored hair that is tied into a bun at the back and has flowers attached on the right side. She wears a dark-colored kimono with a light-and-dark checkerboard pattern on the top, as well as a light obi with a star pattern.
Queen
considers her to be very beautiful, and states that she is his second choice for a partner behind only
Komurasaki
.
Personality
[
]
Some is a meek woman who was quick to apologize for getting in
Sanji
's way, not wanting to be mistaken for a combatant in the war on
Onigashima
. When she was attacked by Queen (with Sanji appearing to be the perpetrator at the time), Some was shown with a look of great fear on her face.
She is also shown to be quite caring, and will be courageous to help those she cares about in danger, seen when she went into a battle area to find and rescue her pet rat
Chuji
. Although she displays great reverence toward the Wano administration and occupying
Beasts Pirates
as is required, Some has rejected the romantic advances of Queen numerous times in spite of the great power the All-Star holds.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being a geisha who was summoned from the
Flower Capital
to perform at
Kurozumi Orochi
and
Kaidou
's
Fire Festival
celebration, it is likely that Some is a very skilled entertainer.
She does not appear to have any fighting skills. When
Queen
unexpectedly attacked her, Some was launched back a great distance and was left with heavy bleeding; however, she did remain conscious after the attack and got up without any adverse effects a short time later.
History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Some worked as a geisha in the
Flower Capital
and was brought to
Onigashima
on the day of the
Fire Festival
to provide entertainment for
Kurozumi Orochi
and
Kaidou
's festivities. The
Beasts Pirates
All-Star
Queen
tried to buy her services numerous times, but she turned him down. When fighting broke out as pirates and Wano citizens invaded Onigashima, Some and the other geisha hid inside a room in the Left Brain Tower Pleasure Hall. Some then went out into the hall where she encountered a running
Sanji
, and she assured him she meant no harm. However Queen, who had activated his invisibility power, came in and struck Some to the ground. Some was tended to by her fellow geisha, and since Queen was invisible, they believed that Sanji had been the one to strike her.
Not too long afterward, Some recovered from her injuries and went out to find her pet rat
Chuji
, despite Sanji and Queen fighting furiously right outside. She found Chuji and beckoned him to her, not realizing that Queen was invisible and coming up to attack her again for turning him down. However, Sanji then appeared and struck Queen, making him visible and leaving Some in surprise.
She was relieved when Sanji sent Queen flying out of Onigashima and returned Chuji to her, only for him to collapse in front of her. She then called for help to come to Sanji's aid.
Some laid Sanji down on a futon and gave him medical care, cleaning his body and bandaging him.
Later, she was surprised when he suddenly woke up after
sensing
Luffy
's
awakening
on the roof.
Some and other geisha then followed Sanji in an attempt to escape the fire inside the
Skull Dome
, but found it impossible to go outside due to the island having crumbled away.
They were saved from the fire when
Raizo
flooded the dome with water. However, Some struggled to withstand the force of the flow and had to hold onto Sanji to avoid being swept away.
Final Saga

Oni Child Yamato's Golden Harvest Surrogate Pilgrimage
[
]
Some was among the crowd of people watching
Yamato
receive provisions from
O-Tsuru
in the
Flower Capital
. She cheerfully waved at Yamato while holding
Chuji
in her right hand.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Some and Sanji's anime-original interaction.
Some is featured in a segment of the
anime-original
farewell episode before the
Straw Hat Pirates
depart from
Wano Country
. The segment shows that after the end of the
Raid on Onigashima
, Some returned to geisha training under
Tsugaru Umi
. She seems to have become infatuated with
Sanji
and a regular customer for his soba. During their last interaction, she became flustered when Sanji scratched
Chuji
who was peeking out of her kimono. She was saddened upon hearing that Sanji was going to leave soon, and was about to say something to him when they were interrupted by
Robin
and
Brook
.
