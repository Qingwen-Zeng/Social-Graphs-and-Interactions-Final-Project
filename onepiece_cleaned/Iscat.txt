at Bigstein Castle and caught him in its mouth.
Nami
then came to save him by using an electric attack from
Zeus
. Afterwards, Iscat used a powerful swipe attack that destroyed part of the castle, and forced them all to fall to the ground. It approached Nami and Usopp in its lion form and prepared to finish them off. Before it could attack,
Luffy
,
Zoro
, and
Sanji
arrived and used a combination attack against it, causing it to fall unconscious and revert to its normal form.
While the Straw Hats were escaping from the
