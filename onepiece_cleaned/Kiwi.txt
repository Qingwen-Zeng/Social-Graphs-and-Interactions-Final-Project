History
[
]
Past
[
]
Twelve years ago, after
Tom's Workers
had completed the
Puffing Tom
, Mozu and Kiwi rode the
Sea Train
on its opening day.
They were inspired by this event and tried to be shipwrights; however, they failed the Galley-La company tests and began drinking heavily.
They were then found by
Franky
and started working for him after he had encouraged them to stop drinking.
Water 7 Saga
[

Water 7 Arc
[
]
Franky and the Square Sisters confront Luffy.
In the
Franky House
, Mozu and Kiwi stood at Franky's sides while he counted money that the Franky Family stole from the
Straw Hat Pirates
. After Franky had beaten up
Usopp
, who had come to take back the money, Mozu and Kiwi followed Franky out the door. They boarded the
Sea Train
and went shopping with the stolen money.
The next day, when they returned from their shopping trip, Franky and the sisters were shocked to find the Franky House in ruins.
Zambai
informed them that it was the Straw Hats who destroyed the building and that they will be at
Dock 1
, so Franky and the sisters went to the closed dock to confront
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Nami
.
The sisters mimicked Franky's poses and then cheered Franky on as he fought Luffy.
The sisters were disgruntled by the
Galley-La
employees' interruption of the fight.
While the shipwrights attacked Luffy, Franky and the sisters sat by and had tea before flipping the table in outrage over the continued interference in Franky's fight with Luffy. After Franky's
Coup de Vent
destroyed Dock 1, the sister questioned if Franky was going to pursue Luffy, who had escaped in the destruction, but Franky needed to refuel first.
Afterwards, the three visited
Blueno
's bar, and Franky refilled on cola and dispersed the remaining stolen money to the other patrons. The sisters enjoyed their own drinks, while Franky talked with
Kokoro
.
The sisters were confused when Franky smashed the counter in frustration, but they followed him as he stormed out. As they left, Kiwi thanked Blueno for the drinks.
As the
Aqua Laguna
approached, the strong winds forced Mozu and Kiwi to walk sideways. They reconnected with the rest of the Franky Family, and Franky planned to kidnap Usopp in order to lure out the other Straw Hats.
Franky and the sisters took Usopp and the
Going Merry
to their secret warehouse under the bridge. They cried after hearing Usopp's story about leaving the Straw Hats, but cheered up when Franky tried to turn it into a song. After Franky and Usopp had agreed to put aside their past transgressions against each other, Franky offered Usopp a position as a ship demolisher, but Usopp refused since he was still a pirate. Kiwi served them all tea, while Franky and Mozu explained the Aqua Laguna, Water 7's fate, and the Sea Train. Franky and Usopp then got into a fight over dismantling the Going Merry.
The sisters were shocked by Franky's harsh treatment of Usopp and Merry, and began crying alongside Usopp during the discussion of
Klabautermann
.
Afterwards,
CP9
rang the doorbell of the warehouse.
The sisters thought it was the rest of the family bringing the Straw Hats to them. When they answered the door, both sisters were knocked down, with
Kalifa
taking down Kiwi with a kick to the neck.
Determined to save the abducted Franky, the sisters and the rest of the Franky Family tracked down the Straw Hats and begged to join Luffy on the
Rocketman
. Luffy accepted so the Franky Family attached their
King Bulls
,
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
, to the rear of the sea train.
After the train had found the tracks, the sisters and Zambai attended a meeting in the rear compartment, where the Straw Hats, Franky Family, and Galley-La shipwrights agreed to work together.
When the train faced crashing into the Aqua Laguna wave, Luffy and
Roronoa Zoro
punched and slashed a hole through the wave, which greatly impressed Mozu and Kiwi, along with everyone else.
Later, after Nami had changed clothes in front of everyone, Mozu and Kiwi teased
Paulie
, who complained about the women's immodesty.
While bored on the train, the sisters participated in a reenactment of Luffy and Zoro splitting the Aqua Laguna wave. When the Rocketman came upon the Puffing Tom's discarded train cars, Zoro cut the cars in half, which completely shocked the sisters. As the train continued, the sisters were worried to learn that "Ship Cutter"
T Bone
was standing ahead on the tracks. However, Zoro defeated the Marine Captain, and the sisters celebrated and praised Zoro.
When
Yokozuna
jumped onto the track, Luffy demanded that the train turn around, which confused the sisters and the others.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Yokozuna knocked the train off the track and separated the train from the Franky Family's ship. Kokoro and Nami managed to navigate the train and locate the Franky Family, and then continued on to Enies Lobby.
As they approached the island, the Franky Family, Straw Hats, and Galley-La workers laid down their plan of attack. Usopp introduced himself as Sogeking, but the sisters saw through the disguise. The Franky Family and Galley-La workers volunteered to go ahead and force open the two gates so that the Straw Hats could ride the train through.
They fought their way through the Marines and opened the main gate, but when they reached the island gate, they were confronted by
Oimo
and
Kashii
, the two
giant
gatekeepers.
Mozu, Kiwi, and Zamabi, along with the Galley-La members, prepared Sodom and Gomorrah for battling on land, while the rest of the family fought the giants. After riding the King Bulls into battle, Mozu and Kiwi sliced apart Kashii's shoe so that Paulie and Zambai could knock the giant backwards. They then tricked Oimo into slamming his club into Kashii's face, knocking the fellow giant unconscious.
While the others continued fighting, Mozu and Kiwi snuck into the gatehouse and unlocked the gate. The Franky Family and Galley-La employees then wrapped up Oimo and pushed open the gate.
The Marines questioned if these infiltrators were the Straw Hats; Zambai announced that they were, which shocked Mozu and Kiwi. The
Watchdog Unit of the Law
then confronted the infiltrators and woke up Oimo; however, the
Rocketman
flew over the gate and slammed into the giant's back. The Franky Family rejoiced to see the Straw Hats
and watched as the pirates took down more Marines. The Franky Family and Straw Hats rode the King Bulls further into the fortress, while the Galley-La employees stayed behind to hold off the Watchdog Unit and Marines.

As they reached the courthouse, Sodom was grievously wounded, so his passengers shifted to Gomorrah and the group continued forward.
After Kokoro called and told them how to lower the drawbridge, the Franky Family planned to split into two groups, but the
Just Eleven Jurymen
, the Marines, and the World Government agents stopped Gomorrah and surrounded the infiltrators.
Despite his injuries, Gomorrah charged through the crowd and carried the infiltrators into the courthouse square.
Mozu and Kiwi led separate teams up the towers to lower the drawbridge, while Zambai led a third team to follow the Straw Hats into the courthouse itself.
Mozu and Kiwi's teams struggled to combat the Marines, agents,
and Jurymen but refused to give up on their mission.

With help from
Peepley Lulu
and
Tilestone
, Mozu's and Kiwi's teams managed to overcome the Jurymen and reach their respective levers, lowering the drawbridge. However, courthouse defenses fired mortars at the bridge, disabling it. The Franky Family spotted Franky on the Tower of Justice and called out to him, and Franky was moved by their rescue attempt. They watched in horror as Spandam shoved Franky off the tower, but Kokoro drove the Rocketman through the courthouse and over the drawbridge, launching it into the air and catching Franky.
The Franky Family cheered on Franky and the Straw Hats.
Afterwards, the Marines and Government agents captured and restrained the Franky Family and Galley-La employees. When Spandam accidentally announced that he had triggered a
Buster Call
on the island, the Marines and agents fled, leaving behind the captives.
Paulie, who had pretended to be tied up like the others, freed the captives.
Kashii and Oimo, who had been befriended by Usopp, carried the Franky Family, the King Bulls, and the Galley-La employees as they raced to escape the island before the Buster call could begin.
They watched in awe as the Gates of Justice fully opened
and were shocked when the warships toppled the Tower of Justice and began bombarding the island.
Upon reaching the coast, the Franky Family was met with three warships, and Vice Admiral
Strawberry
ordered to stay where they were until the Marines and Government agents were loaded on to the ships. Mozu and Kiwi voiced their desperation as there was nowhere to retreat. Once their men were safely aboard, the warships pulled back and began bombarding the island, knocking the Franky Family and others off a cliff,
but they were all saved at the last minute by Paulie's ropes. The Straw Hats and Marines were alerted to their survival when they cheered on Luffy's victory over Lucci. They climbed back up the cliff
and escaped on the Sea Train.
Post Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Mozu and Kiwi accompanied Franky to visit the Straw Hats to inform them of their leader's decision to build them a new ship. They then bore witness to the sudden appearance of Vice Admiral
Garp
, whom they were shocked to learn was Luffy's grandfather
and became even more surprised to learn that Luffy's father was
Revolutionary Dragon
.
They later took a break from shipbuilding to party with their new friends and allies at the Galley-La Headquarters.
When Franky and Yokozuna returned to working on the ship, Mozu and Kiwi watched as Iceburg and other Galley-La employees arrived to help in the construction.
Mozu, Kiwi, Chimney, and Gonbe ran to where the Straw Hats had been staying and announced that construction had finished. On the way to Scrap Island, they and the Straw Hats were stopped by the Franky Family, who revealed the Straw Hats' new bounties, as well as Franky's wanted poster. Mozu and Kiwi were distressed over Franky's safety, and Zambai implored for Luffy to take Franky as a crewmate, even if it required force.
Once the Straw Hats were packed, Mozu and Kiwi led them down to the
Thousand Sunny
, but Franky had already left. The Franky Family forced Franky back to Scrap Island, stealing his briefs and firing him from a cannon, much to Mozu and Kiwi's shock. Luffy then asked Franky to join his crew,
but Franky refused. Robin attempted to force him to join by squeezing his testicles, which horrified Mozu and Kiwi, who feared that they would fall off like fruits from a tree. Franky finally accepted after Iceburg and Zanmai talked him into it. Mozu and Kiwi cried as Franky bid farewell.
After the Straw Hats' departure, the sisters, along with the other members of the Franky Family, were offered jobs by Iceburg, whom they started calling their new "Big Bro" as thanks, much to his annoyance.
