Personality

Like all other mermaids, Seira is kind and caring, and is apparently fun loving.
When meeting
Luffy
,
Usopp
,
Sanji
and
Chopper
for the first time she comments approvingly on their boldness of having entered
Fish-Man Island
illegally, stating that she loves pirates, which is probably why she seems to like Sanji like the rest of her friends.

Being a mermaid, Seira has several abilities unique to her race. It is not yet shown but she may have the ability to talk to fish and call out to them using sonar waves, which is one of the basic abilities found in all mermaids and some Fish-Men. Apart from the ability to breathe underwater, as a mermaid she also has the ability to swim very quickly at speeds much faster than the flying fish used by the
Flying Fish Riders
. However, like any mermaid, she is vulnerable on land.
She also appears to be a skilled dancer.

Hammond
's attack, the princes made it clear that they were simply trying to deliver
Jinbe
's message to
Monkey D. Luffy
