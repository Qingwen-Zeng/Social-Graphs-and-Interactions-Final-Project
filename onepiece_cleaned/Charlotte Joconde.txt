Joconde came to
Cacao Island
along with many of her siblings and crewmates to stand guard in preparation for an attack on the
Straw Hat Pirates
. When she saw how much of their forces was gathered to take on the Straw Hats, Joconde stated that Big Mom's name was weeping.
As the Straw Hats' promised rendezvous time drew near, the Big Mom Pirates prepared to ambush
Monkey D. Luffy
once he exited the
Mirro-World
.
She was then preoccupied with fighting
Germa 66
's forces that she did not notice
Oven
's command to stop Luffy and
Sanji
from escaping.
After the Straw Hats escaped, Joconde cheered as Big Mom herself arrived to the battlefield.
