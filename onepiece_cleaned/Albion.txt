"Gashed" Albion
is one of the rookie
pirates
who joined the
Fake Straw Hat Crew
. He has a bounty of
92,000,000.
Appearance
[
]
Albion is a pale man with a large, ovular head that is wrapped in bandages, like most of his body, from his forehead to his scalp, with his face only occupying the lowest part of his head. He has a long black ponytail on the back of his head, growing out from under the bandages, and wears a captain's coat. Around his neck is what appears to be a shirt collar with two buttons that have "A" on them, along with a red and maroon striped tie around his neck. He also has a dark yellow sash around his waist.
He has three thin daggers on his right hip and is also seen carrying a sword in his left hand.
Personality
[
]
Albion seemed calm when
Caribou
attacked the
Marines
but appeared annoyed by his attitude. Albion appears to be among the many others who were easily fooled by Fake Straw Hats' charade. Still, his desire to have his name known throughout the seas may have contributed to his decision to join
Demaro Black
's crew, as he did not question the dubious credibility of the fake Straw Hats. He quickly became angered upon realizing that his "boss" was a fake weakling, accusing the latter of taking advantage of the real
Luffy
, whom everyone thought to be dead, all the while considering Black to be a "random piece of trash worth a mere 26 million". As
Sentomaru
put it, Albion and the rest of the recruits were stupid for being so easily duped by the frauds.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Albion's weapons during the reunion with the Fake Straw Hats.
Not much is known about his abilities. It can be assumed that he is rather strong since he was able to make it all the way to
Sabaody Archipelago
and almost became a Supernova. He was also able to escape
Sentomaru
's platoon, when most of the other recruits were apprehended.
Weapons
[
]
He has at least four bladed weapons, so it might be assumed that he is a
swordsman
. He is seen holding three daggers between the fingers on his right hand and using them like claws, similar to
Buggy
's knife-combat style. He uses a curved
sword
in his left hand.
History
[
]
Return to Sabaody Arc
[
]
Albion arrived at
Sabaody Archipelago
around the same time as the
Straw Hat Pirates
' reunion. While there, he joined the
Fake Straw Hat Crew
, which he believed to be the true ones, and gathered at Grove 46 along with the rest of the
pirates
who had been recruited.
After
Caribou
instigated a fight with the
Marines
, Sentomaru arrived with two
Pacifistas
and revealed that
Demaro Black
had impersonated the real
Monkey D. Luffy
and deceived the pirates, which angered Albion and the others.
Albion was among the pirates who evaded capture by the Marines.
