captain
whose crew was captured by the
Kid Pirates
as they tried to escape back to
Paradise
from the
New World
.
Appearance

]
Kendiyo is a large man, bigger than Kid, and slightly fat as well. He has bushy brown hair and a scraggly beard, and wore a red captain's coat over a white shirt and brown pants. He has a sword over his back.
Personality
[
]
Kendiyo is shown to be a weak-hearted pirate. After his defeat and capture by the Kid Pirates, he wanted to run away and return to Paradise with his crew.
He seems to be very caring toward his crew as he begged Kid to let him and his crew escape alive from the New World and return to
Paradise
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Judging by the fact that he was able to make it all the way to the New World, it can be assumed he has some strength. However, he was no match for the harsh conditions of the New World or Eustass Kid, and was eventually captured by the latter.
Weapons
[

He has a sword, which he is presumably competent in using it.
