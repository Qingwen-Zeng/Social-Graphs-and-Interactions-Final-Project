Past
[
]
Spandine and his agents arrive at Ohara.
Kamaya was alongside the then-CP9 chief,
Spandine
, as he entered
Ohara
in the
West Blue
under the orders of the
World Government
. They were attempting to stop the
scholars
in Ohara from illegally studying the
Poneglyphs
, and warranted an investigation. However, this was merely an excuse to launch a
Buster Call
against the entire island. Kamaya alerted Spandine that the
Marines
were trying to contact him, but was ordered to ignore the call.
On the island, Kamaya ordered his subordinates to round up anyone who called themselves a scholar. Following this, Kamaya accompanied Spandine to a nearby forest, where they confronted
Nico Olvia
. Together with
Laskey
, Kamaya handily beat the woman and then carried her unconscious body to town, where the other scholars were awaiting punishment. With their mission accomplished, Spandine ordered Kamaya to contact the
Five Elders
for a report.
