"Sonar King" Shoujou
is the
big boss
(
大園長
,
ō bosu
?
)
of the
Shoujou Pirates
, the head of underwater sonar operations around
Jaya
's coast, the sworn brother of
Masira
, and a follower of
Mont Blanc Cricket
, as part of the
Saruyama Alliance
. He and Masira were both fans of
Liar Noland
, the fairy tale concerning Cricket's ancestor,
Mont Blanc Noland
.
He became an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Jaya Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Shoujou is a large man who looks like an orangutan with long green hair. He wears a black button up shirt that is too small for his body showing off his hairy torso, a green captain's coat with his arms in the sleeves, and a green captain's hat with his personal
jolly roger
on the front. He also wears a belt that has the kanji for forest engraved upon it. Due to not having cut his hair in twenty five years, his hair is so long that its entire length is almost as long as Shoujou's entire body height. Despite looking like another species, he is actually a
human
.
After the timeskip he has removed his coat and has replaced his captain's hat with a wide brimmed straw hat. He is also seen with a container with the beetle Luffy gave him in it hanging from a strap that goes across his chest.
Personality
[
]
Shoujou shares his brother's short temper and territorial attitude, but unlike him, he is more laid-back and dislikes being referred to as a monkey. Still, he befriends the
Straw Hats
with the same ease.
Despite his friendly attitude, he does think highly of his power and abilities. He confidently states that he is the logical replacement for
Crocodile
as a
Warlord of the Sea
, despite clearly being nowhere near Crocodile's level of power. He has the habit of telling trivia about his own life to others, asking them if they are impressed about it, but is usually ignored.
Like his brother, he is protective of Cricket, who they have come to know as a father figure. He and his fellow Alliance members displayed an amazing spirit to get back up and continue their modifications to the
Going Merry
after
Bellamy
's attacks. On their last encounter with the Straw Hats, they left on good terms.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Shoujou commands a large crew of pirates that makes up nearly one half of the Saruyama Alliance. Shoujou and the pirates under him are experts in underwater sonar echo location. They aid
Mont Blanc Cricket
in his search by searching the seas around Jaya using sonar.
Shoujou himself has a very special type of voice that he uses in both underwater search and in battle. He also wields a microphone that allows him to amplify his voice's strength and reach.
Techniques
[
]
Search Sonar
(
探索の雄叫び
,
Sāchi Sonā
?
, literally meaning "Roar of Search")
: When searching, Shoujou sends sound waves from his
ship
to the water below via a microphone. Shoujou's
Utan Divers
then listen for the echoes of these sound waves and determine the identity and location of the various underwater objects surrounding Shoujou's ship in a radius.
Havoc Sonar
(
破壊の雄叫び
,
Habokku Sonā
?
, literally meaning "Roar of Destruction")
: When engaged in battle, Shoujou can use his voice to make a special noise into his microphone that sends out destructive sound waves causing pain to anyone and damaging anything nearby. This technique was first seen being used in a failed attempt to strike at the Straw Hats and their ship, the
Going Merry
.
Non-Canon Techniques
[
]
Saru Lunge
(
猿ランジ
,
Saru Ranji
?
, "Monkey Lunge")
: An anime only attack, both he and
Masira
launch a strong punch against their opponents. This was first used against the Bellamy Pirates. In the Funimation dub it is called
Monkey Punch
.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
"Shoujou
" (originally the name of
a vaguely ape-like mythological creature
) is the Japanese for
orangutan
(
猩猩
?
)
, fitting with the Saruyama Alliance's simian theme.
It may also be a joke on the
Shōjo
(
少女
?
)
manga demographic
, whose female-targeted leads stereotypically have long, flowing hair—a trait that this character takes to an unsanitary, "realistic" extreme.
Due to the presence of two
"long"
o
s
in his name, it has received varying romanizations:
Shojoe
by
4Kids
(in the
Pirates Carnival
video game),
Shojo
by
Funimation
, and
Shoujou
by
Viz
. The last of these was eventually determined
canon
by the
Vivre Card databook
.
The kanji in his title of "big boss"
(
大園長
,
ō bosu
?
)
literally means "zoo director", playing into his ape/monkey theme.
