Baron Tamago
(also known as
Viscount Hiyoko
and
Count Niwatori
in his second and third form respectively) is a knight-ranked
combatant
of the
Big Mom Pirates
,
who originates from the
Longleg Tribe
. He and his partner
Pekoms
were responsible for collecting the monthly payment of sweets from
Fish-Man Island
in exchange for
Big Mom
's protection.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist during the
Whole Cake Island Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Baron Tamago is tall due to his long and lanky thin legs. He has many wrinkles on his forehead and a big mustache that curls upwards. He also wears sunglasses
and has a scar over his left eye which he lost during a previous fight with
Pedro
five years ago.
On top of his head, he sports a magenta cup full of hot tea and saucer which he drinks from at times.
As Baron Tamago, he appears to wear magenta pants with an egg shell like shape that goes up to his belly. He wears a formal magenta tuxedo as well, along with a pink shirt underneath, and a yellow bowtie. He carries a long wooden cane with him. Tamago's rather strange appearance caused
Zoro
to comically mistake him for a compass.
As Viscount Hiyoko, he has a yellow skin color, and his arms and hands have transformed into wings. His attire changed and he has a yellow suit with white pants.
As Count Niwatori, he resembles a large rooster wearing a pale pink suit.
Personality
[
]
Tamago always uses French words like "bon" at the beginning of his sentences and "soir" and "s'il vous plaît" at the end of his sentences. He uses "bon" as a suffix and prefix, but mostly a suffix.
Also, in reference to his egg-theme, Tamago often uses egg-related puns. He refers to inexperienced people as "half-boiled" and when people surprise him with their ignorance, he even calls them "raw".
When he says "you" he uses the kanji for "egg yolk"
(
黄味
?
)
, as both are pronounced
kimi
.
He is polite and negotiable, as well as rather intelligent, as he saw exchanging the treasure for some extra time to make more candy to be perfectly acceptable. Tamago even offered to give the citizens more time until they could accomplish the task (although the time he gave them was clearly insufficient compared to the situation explained). He even fully elaborated the protection Big Mom lent to
Fish-Man Island
in exchange for candy to the
Straw Hats
' "Monster Trio", along with the consequences of them failing to fulfill their end of the bargain. Like most of Big Mom's subordinates, Tamago is afraid of her.
Tamago seems to dislike arrogance as shown when he admitted being disgusted by
Caribou
after Pekoms noted that
Logia
users who thought themselves to be invincible did not tend to live long.
Ironically, he himself is subjected to displays of boasting as during his second fight against Pedro, he bragged about his superior speed compared to the mink's. After the misfortunes the Big Mom Pirates suffered since the Straw Hats arrived at Whole Cake Island, Niwatori became concerned of how they underestimated the Straw Hats and even warned Mont-d'Or that arrogance could lead to negative consequences.
Tamago follows his missions to the letter, even at the expense of his partners, as he condoned Capone Bege's decision to shoot Pekoms because Pekoms was willing to let the Straw Hats go as thanks for their protection of Zou. Despite that, when finding out Pekoms survived and was on Whole Cake island, Tamago stated he intended to bring him before Big Mom and have the latter beg her for forgiveness while mentioning their past as comrades.
That being said, Tamago is very loyal to Big Mom and her crew, and gets furious if anyone betrays them. He was furious when he found out about Bege's assassination plot against her, adding how he used to admire his skill, and was later shocked upon learning that Pekoms betrayed the crew to assist the Straw Hats' escape.
Tamago also does not follow the popular trend of exposing and decorating his longlegs like other members of his tribe do.
Relationships
[
]
Big Mom Pirates
[
]
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Like a lot of people of her
crew
, Tamago is scared of
Big Mom
and wishes to avoid bringing her bad news, as he does not want to be the target of her resulting rage. However, he still dares to disagree and try to correct her when she is angry, such as when he suggested accepting the
Straw Hats
' offer of treasure instead of candy to repair ships that were destroyed by Eustass Kid.
Big Mom does seem to value Tamago to a certain degree. She was angry at
Pedro
for scarring Tamago's left eye, though her indignant mood subsided when Pedro took out his own left eye.
Despite being terrified of Big Mom, Tamago held undying loyalty towards his captain as he was enraged to learn that Bege had been plotting to assassinate her.
He also urged Mont-d'Or to take extreme measures to prevent Big Mom's name from getting tarnished.
Pekoms
[
]
Tamago and
Pekoms
get along quite well. They are colleagues who collect the candy payment for Big Mom together. Tamago calms Pekoms down when he gets angry and negotiates with their customers on his behalf.
When
Capone Bege
tried to kill Pekoms due to him abandoning the mission, Tamago approved Bege's decision, showing that he puts his missions over his allies. However, in spite of that, when he heard of Pekoms' survival and arrival on the island, he intended to beg Big Mom to forgive Pekoms to honor their long history together. Hearing that Pekoms went with the Straw Hats seems to have made the situation more troubling for him.
After the destruction of the Whole Cake Chateau, the two were reunited and went back to serving the crew.
However, he was shocked to learn that Pekoms betrayed his crew to assist Luffy.
Charlotte Smoothie
[
]
He appears to be well respected by Sweet Commander
Smoothie
as she was willing to heed his advice despite her outranking him.
Smoothie even apologized to him after realizing he was right about
Pedro
having an
accomplice
who broke into the treasure room.
Enemies
[
]
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Tamago was initially quite compliant with the Straw Hat Pirates, wanting to accept their offer of treasure and conversing with them politely.
However while their first encounter was on positive terms, it did not leave any impression on Tamago. When they met again, it was Tamago's mission to retrieve
Caesar Clown
. Tamago wanted just to kill all the Straw Hats by sinking
their ship
and then to retrieve Caesar from the wreckage.
Later on, Tamago attempted to recruit
Sanji
into the Big Mom Pirates due to the latter's impending wedding to Pudding only for Sanji to reject the offer.
He also had Big Mom's troops watch the Sanji Retrieval Team's movements while they were in the Seducing Woods.
Niwatori appears to have recognized the luck that the crew has due to them being people Pedro was willing to sacrifice himself for. He tried to implore his crew not to underestimate them because of the recent events that have occurred since their invasion but his warnings were ignored.
Pedro
[
]
Tamago knows Pedro since the latter once attempted to steal Big Mom's
poneglyphs
. It seems that he is extra-cautious around the
mink
, as he would even need the assistance of a Sweet Commander just to make sure Pedro fails in his quest to acquire the poneglyphs in their possession.
He also respects the mink well enough that he would always correct his soldiers in calling Pedro a "Jaguar" mink, whenever they would misidentify him as some other species of cat.
When Pedro was cornered in Big Mom's courtyard, Tamago stepped out to confront him and mocked him for his futile effort. It is also revealed that Pedro was the one who took Tamago's left eye.
Tamago also seemed to be sad at Pedro's assumed sacrifice due to his respect for the man's noble intentions. Furthermore, Pedro's self sacrifice gave Niwatori a new perspective of the Straw Hats.
Capone Bege
[
]
Tamago had utmost respect and trust for Bege as a Rook of the Big Mom Pirates and was extremely furious to learn that he had betrayed the crew by attempting to assassinate Big Mom.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Tamago, like many others in the crew, is responsible for collecting candy payments from the various islands under Big Mom's protection,
and is trusted by his captain enough to be assigned a knight rank.
He is a very powerful man, given his bounty, and was able to emerge from a battle against
Pedro
, the captain of the
Mink Tribe
's
Guardians
with a bounty of
382,000,000, with only a scar on his left eye to show for it.
Intelligence
[
]
Tamago is intelligent and cautious with impressive intuition as he became the first to notice Luffy's potential and threat to the Big Mom Pirates as Luffy's allies began supporting the Straw Hat Pirates.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Tamago is extremely strong, in contrast to his disproportionate, thin-limbed build. He was able to easily lift, with each of his thin arms, a sack larger than his own torso of gold and jewelry.
As one of the
Longleg Tribe
, his legs are considered the main point of his combat strength and, at the same time, his weakness.
He is capable of performing rapid kick attacks, horizontally spinning his legs in a whirlwind motion akin to a rolling cartwheel, which are powerful enough to send opponents crashing into walls. Due to his legs' length, his kicks have great range (superior, by his own word, to that of Pedro's sword strokes), and he is capable of clashing his legs directly against a blade with no apparent repercussions.
He wears special tights that can protect him from electric attacks, particularly
Electro
.
He is also quite agile, as he kept up with Pedro's own very impressive speed (all the while preventing the cup atop his head from spilling).
Attacks
[
]
Leg Benedict
(
レッグ・ベネディクト
,
Reggu Benedikuto
?
)
: After performing a whirlwind of kicks, Tamago kicks his opponent horizontally across their face, sending them flying back. It was first seen in his second battle with Pedro.
This attack's name is a pun on "leg" and the breakfast dish "
eggs Benedict
".

Sunny-Side Legs
(
サニーサイド レッグ
,
Sanīsaido Reggu
?
)
: Tamago flips upside-down and spins rapidly like a top, delivering a flurry of kicks.
This attack's name is a pun on "leg" and "sunny-side up", a method of preparing fried eggs.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Main article:
Tama Tama no Mi
Tamago evolves into a chicken.
Tamago ate the Tama Tama no Mi, a
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that makes his body composition like that of an egg; the external surface of his body is like an eggshell with a giant egg yolk inside. When his eggshell body takes significant damage, it will break like an egg. Once broken, Tamago will regenerate from the yolk, evolved into a stronger chicken-like form.
He has three forms,
Baron Tamago
being his base form,
Viscount Hiyoko
which resembles a chick, and
Count Niwatori
which resembles a rooster. He is stated to become stronger in combat each time he regenerates and evolves, and is a "true knight" once he reaches his third form.
Should his strongest form be destroyed, he reverts to his base form. This endless cycle effectively prevents him from dying in battle, as long as his yolk is not killed in the midst of an evolution.
Haki
[
]
Further information:
Haki
Tamago possesses the ability to use
Armament
and
Observation Haki
.
Despite this, he has never been seen using either in combat, being more reliant on his Devil Fruit and sword Abilities.
Swordsmanship
[
]
He is highly skilled and experienced in swordsmanship as he is able to hold his own against
Pedro
, a powerful mink swordsman. Tamago uses his swordsmanship in conjunction with his leg attacks, providing a multifaceted offense.
In the anime, Tamago's swordsmanship can be improved by evolving with his Devil Fruit powers. As Viscount Hiyoko, he has shown extreme proficiency and speed in dual wielding knives, able to corner Pedro and even disarm him of his sword.
Weapons
[
]
He is seen carrying a pistol on his right hip, and a shikomizue (cane sword) similar to
Brook
's.
When he becomes Viscount Hiyoko, he wields two knives.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Five years prior to the beginning of the series,
Pedro
and the
Nox Pirates
entered
Big Mom's territory
to search for
poneglyphs
. Tamago clashed with Pedro and lost his left eye in the process. After Pedro was driven out of Totto Land, his crewmate
Pekoms
ended up joining the
Big Mom Pirates
, becoming Tamago's partner in collecting
Big Mom
's candy tributes.
Fish-Man Island Saga
[
]
Fish-Man Island Arc
[
]
Tamago appears on
Fish-Man Island
, in front of the
Candy Factory
. He scolded Pekoms for threatening the citizens, stating that doing so would not help them collect the monthly candy offering any time soon, and warned the inhabitants of Fish-Man Island that Big Mom would destroy them if they did not pay up the sweets. When
Monkey D. Luffy
tried to barter, offering money instead of candy to Big Mom, Tamago tried to reason with Big Mom, stating that
Eustass Kid
had recently sunk two of their pirate ships, and that they needed money. Big Mom harshly scolded Tamago, calling him brain-dead for trying to make a compromise, and demanded that Luffy meet her in the
New World
. Regardless, Fish-Man Island was given this one pardon thanks to Luffy's intervention, and the two envoys were given the large amounts of treasure in compensation, including the
Tamatebako
.
After taking all the treasure that Luffy offered, they were attacked by
Caribou
, who had stolen the treasure first. Pekoms easily defeated Caribou and Big Mom's two messengers left the island.

After seeing Caesar's defeat by Luffy, Tamago suggested that they call Big Mom.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Later on, Tamago, along with Pekoms and the
Fire Tank Pirates
, were part of the group of Big Mom Pirates which pursued the
Curly Hat Pirates
off
Dressrosa
, in order to claim Caesar Clown.
During the pursuit, the group was surprised that the Curly Hats were able to fight back and escape.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Zou Arc
[
]
A few days after retrieving
Sanji
from
Zou
, Tamago conversed with Sanji aboard
Big Mom's ship
, attempting to convince Sanji to accept Big Mom's invitation to join her crew.
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Tamago gives Judge exploding wristlets to put on Sanji.
Sometime afterward, Tamago gave a pair of exploding wristlets to
Vinsmoke Judge
to put on Sanji should the Vinsmoke patriarch have problems with his son.
A few days later on
Whole Cake Island
, Tamago was in Sweet City when Big Mom developed a craving for croquembouche and went on a rampage. He noted that croquembouche tourists were staying in the city, but was told that they had already checked out. He and the other residents of Sweet City began panicking as Big Mom arrived and started eating everything in her path, although she was later stopped by
Jinbe
.
The next day, Tamago took
Charlotte Pudding
to try on wedding dresses, despite her insistence that she has matters to attend to elsewhere. Tamago was then brought outside by soldiers as they told him that Pekoms was nowhere to be found, and that they had located all but two of the
Sanji Retrieval Team
in the Seducing Woods. Tamago stated that the mink they had yet to locate was Pedro. Since the two were acquainted, Tamago thought he knew where the
mink
may be. However, Tamago told the soldiers to search for Pekoms, as he had wanted to bring his partner back in good standing but was in a pinch because of his disappearance.
Tamago at the Room of Treasure.
Tamago later increased security at the Room of Treasure, where the three poneglyphs in Big Mom's possession were stored. Aware of Pedro's goal, he guarded the poneglyphs alongside the Sweet Commander,
Charlotte Smoothie
.
After hearing that Pedro was spotted, Tamago and some soldiers immediately pursued the intruder.
As he was chasing after Pedro, he told some guards to corner him at the garden. He was then contacted by Smoothie via Den Den Mushi. She informed him of a second intruder, who managed to enter the Room of Treasure and locked Smoothie outside. Tamago told Smoothie to capture Brook alive so Big Mom could add him to her collection.
Right after Pedro ran into the courtyard, Tamago and his men confronted him. Tamago then reminisced of their previous encounter five years ago and reminded Pedro on how Big Mom
stole 50 years of his lifespan
. Pedro replied that he had no intention of leaving Whole Cake Island alive.
Tamago is cut in half by Pedro.
As Tamago and Pedro clashed, Tamago demanded to know why Pedro had returned despite his shortened lifespan. Pedro explained that he had done so for the Straw Hats, whom he believed would one day surpass him and Tamago while causing the world to transition into its "dawn", but clarified that he had no intention of dying until they had achieved their goals as he cut Tamago in half, causing a giant yolk to fly out of his body.
Using
his Devil Fruit power
, Tamago evolved into Viscount Hiyoko, gaining a chicken beak and wings, and attacked Pedro with two knives. However, Pedro quickly cut apart Hiyoko, who began to evolve into his next form, Count Niwatori. Pedro then set off a large collection of explosives in his jacket, causing a massive explosion that engulfed Niwatori and his soldiers.
However, Niwatori survived the explosion and attended a meeting with the other Big Mom Pirates, where they discussed the status of the Sanji Retrieval Team and the
Vinsmoke Family
. He mistakenly assured
Mont-d'Or
's assertion that Pedro had blown himself up in the courtyard.
The next day, Niwatori was on the third floor of the Whole Cake Chateau during the wedding ceremony. The Tamatebako dropped to the base of the Chateau and exploded, causing the structure to topple over. As the castle collapsed, Niwatori panicked as he realized what was happening.
He later made it outside the castle ruins and gathered with his crewmates, hearing about what had happened during the ceremony and becoming furious at Bege's treachery. He then revealed that the
Sun Pirates
had run away, but that he had been unable to relay this information due to communications being cut off. Pekoms confirmed this revelation as the rest of the crew prepared to go after their enemies. However, they were interrupted by Big Mom's food-crazed rampage.
Niwatori assists Mont-d'Or in coordinating the pursuit of the Straw Hats.
Niwatori later stood by while Mont-d'Or transmitted instructions to the Big Mom Pirates throughout Totto Land to keep the Straw Hats and the Fire Tank Pirates from escaping.
As Pekoms grieved over Pedro's presumed death, Niwatori expressed his condolences for Pekoms' loss and surprise for Pedro's self-sacrifice before pointing out on how they underestimated the Straw Hats and those unexpected incidents had been occurring since their arrival. He then warned Mont-d'Or that they could not allow the smallest chance for Big Mom's name to be tarnished.
Niwatori was later surprised to hear that the territorial sea slugs went missing.
As night fell,
Stussy
and
Morgans
met with Niwatori and Mont-d'Or. Niwatori remarked on how long Katakuri's fight with Luffy was taking, and Stussy then revealed that the explosion that toppled the Chateau was caused by the Tamatebako.
As the Straw Hats' promised rendezvous time on
Cacao Island
drew near, Niwatori listened as Mont-d'Or promised Morgans that the Big Mom Pirates' forces would crush the Straw Hats.
Niwatori began to panic when he heard that Pekoms had assisted Luffy in reaching Cacao Island. He fell into complete shock when he learned that Luffy  manage to defeat
Katakuri
. Just then he and Mont-d'Or received a report that
Germa 66
arrived on the island.
Niwatori was later excited to hear that Big Mom's craving was satisfied.
