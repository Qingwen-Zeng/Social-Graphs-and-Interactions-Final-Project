History
[
]
During the Timeskip
[
]
Sheepshead was part of the forces led by
Jack
that invaded the
Mokomo Dukedom
searching for
Raizo
of
Wano Country
. Sheepshead mocked the minks living there and became annoyed when they disrespected Jack, causing him to introduce his leader before telling them to hand over Raizo. When
Ginrummy
affirmed that the
Beasts Pirates
' only goal was to capture Raizo, Sheepshead was annoyed that she incorrectly referred to him as a samurai, but was berated for placing too much emphasis on that detail. After the Pleasures were defeated, Sheepshead was shocked by the combat prowess of the minks before joining the battle himself alongside the rest of the Gifters.
The battle changed as
Inuarashi
and the
Musketeer Squad
arrived, later followed by
Nekomamushi
and the
Guardians
,
but the Beasts Pirates continued fighting. The fight lasted for five days, and the minks eventually managed to gain the upper hand. However, the Beasts Pirates won the battle after Jack brought out
Koro
,
Caesar Clown
's gas weapon, and laid waste to the city and its inhabitants.
