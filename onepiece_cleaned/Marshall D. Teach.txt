Marshall D. Teach
,
most commonly referred to by his epithet
"Blackbeard"
,
is the
captain
-turned-
admiral
of the
Blackbeard Pirates
,
and one of the
Four Emperors
that rule over the
New World
.
He is also the only known person in history to wield the powers of two
Devil Fruits
,
as well as being part of a special bloodline, which is only known to a small number of individuals, including his own crew and the
Five Elders
.
Teach started out his pirate career as an
apprentice
of the
Whitebeard Pirates
, then later became a member of the crew's 2nd Division.
However, he murdered
Thatch
, the 4th Division Commander, in order to steal the
Yami Yami no Mi
, a rare darkness-based
Logia
Devil Fruit with the power to nullify the Devil Fruit abilities of others.
He then fled from Whitebeard's crew and, after defeating the infamous 2nd Division Commander
Portgas D. Ace
and handing him over to the
Marines
,
was awarded a position among the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
. He only held the position briefly, though, using it to infiltrate the great underwater prison
Impel Down
and escaping with multiple infamous Level 6 prisoners recruited into his crew. Upon arriving at the
Summit War of Marineford
,
he resigned from his position and murdered
Whitebeard
, mysteriously stealing his
quake-generating power
. This, along with his victory in the
Payback War
and conquest of the majority of Whitebeard's territories during the
timeskip
, resulted in his acknowledgement as one of the Four Emperors, as well as him being considered a part of the "
Worst Generation
" along with the eleven
Supernovas
.
After the
Rocky Port Incident
, he turned the island of
Hachinosu
into his base of operations with the ambition of having it officially accepted into the
World Government
as the Blackbeard Kingdom.
Teach initially had no
bounty
;
however, after resigning from the Seven Warlords, recruiting several dangerous criminals to his crew from Impel Down, and becoming one of the Four Emperors, he received a bounty of
2,247,600,000.
Following the downfalls of
Kaidou
and
Big Mom
during the
Wano Country Arc
, his bounty was increased to
3,996,000,000 for unknown reasons.
Due to his actions throughout the series, namely his key role in the deaths of Portgas D. Ace and Whitebeard, Teach consistently serves as one of the primary antagonists of the entire series. During the
series' first half
, he is an unseen minor antagonist in the
Drum Island Arc
, a minor antagonist in the
Jaya Arc
, the secondary antagonist of the
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
, and one of the main antagonists of the
Summit War Saga
(specifically, the secondary antagonist of the
Impel Down Arc
and one of the three primary antagonists in the
Marineford Arc
). During the
series' second half
, he is a minor antagonist in the
Dressrosa Arc
, a supporting antagonist in the
Egghead Arc
and serves as one of the overarching main antagonists in the
Final Saga
.
Quick Answers
What are the two Devil Fruits that Marshall D. Teach wields?
Marshall D. Teach, also known as Blackbeard, wields the powers of two Devil Fruits - the Yami Yami no Mi and the Gura Gura no Mi. The Yami Yami no Mi gives him the power of darkness, which can 'reduce anything to nothingness'. The Gura Gura no Mi, on the other hand, grants him the power to create earthquakes. Teach is the first and only known person to wield the powers of two Devil Fruits simultaneously, a feat attributed to his unique body structure.

Marshall D. Teach, also known as Blackbeard, is part of a special bloodline in the One Piece universe. This lineage is known only to a select few, including his own crew and the Five Elders. This bloodline is significant because it hints at a famous lineage and is potentially linked to his unique ability to wield the powers of two Devil Fruits, a feat unheard of in the One Piece world.

How did Marshall D. Teach rise from being a pirate apprentice to an admiral?
Marshall D. Teach, also known as Blackbeard, started his journey as a pirate apprentice. He joined the Whitebeard Pirates, where he spent two decades learning the ropes. However, his ambitions led him to kill a crewmate to acquire the Yami Yami no Mi. He then formed his own crew, the Blackbeard Pirates, and became a captain. His cunning and strategic mind led him to deceive the Marines by joining the Seven Warlords of the Sea, which was a ploy to gain access to Impel Down and recruit powerful crewmates. After usurping the position of Emperor from Edward Newgate, his crew grew into a fleet of ten ships, each led by one of the Ten Titanic Captains, and Teach himself became an admiral.

How old is the character Blackbeard in One Piece?
In the world of One Piece, the notorious pirate Blackbeard, also known as Marshall D. Teach, was 38 years old at his debut. However, after the timeskip in the series, he is now 40 years old. He's known for his towering height and his infamous deeds, making him a character that's hard to forget!
Provided by: Fandom
Appearance
Teach is a very tall man with dark skin, being exactly twice
Luffy
's (pre-timeskip) height. He has a massive build as his body is round with relatively thin limbs. He has a prominent lipped mouth with several broken or missing teeth (though sometimes he does have a full set, which might be an inconsistency error made by
Eiichiro Oda
), a pronounced crooked nose and a very large and hairy chest and torso. Long, thick, woolly black hair falls down the back of his neck, underneath a black bandanna. He also has a black beard that grew around his jawline (hence his epithet).
At his first appearance in
Mock Town
, Teach wore an open buttoned white shirt with rolled up sleeves, green trousers with black line patterns, a yellow sash around his waist and classic black swashbuckler boots complete with large bronze buckles. During his raid on
Banaro Island
, he had added a large black and gold captain's coat over his attire, along with white beads on each wrist as bracelets and rings with gemstones on all of the fingers of both his hands (similar to his predecessor,
Crocodile
). At both of these moments, his beard was still small and scruffy.
At the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
meeting at the
Marine Headquarters
, he added a pair of necklaces of red as well as golden-yellow and blue beads to his dark orange sash (dark yellow in the anime) and a traditional black tricorne hat over his grey bandana, as well as switching to a red shirt, while wearing his captain's coat like a cape. His beard had also gotten thinker and more noticeable at this point.
He also has three
flintlocks
and a flask tied to his sash around his waist.
In
SBS Volume 63
, Oda drew the Seven Warlords of the Sea as children. Teach is shown wearing a baseball cap with a rolled up long sleeve shirt and green shorts. He is also wearing black curled tip shoes, and unlike his usual cheerful expression, is crying for an unknown reason.
After the timeskip, Teach has grown his beard longer and split it into multiple sections, very much like his real-life basis.
He also wears golden hoop earrings and a bigger tricorne with his
Jolly Roger
in front and two white feathers with red tips and a purple flower on the side. Underneath the tricorne he wears a yellow bandana with red polka dots and also now dons a pair of sunglasses. He switched to a light purple shirt with puffy sleeves with a black captain’s coat with red linings along with a cloak made of orange feathers. He now wears dark blue pants with light blue floral designs on them, red and white striped socks and silver buckles on his swashbuckler boots.

Personality
Teach's personality seems to be a strange mixture of courage and cowardice, carefulness and recklessness, and intelligence and stupidity. While at times his character appears strong and fearsome, like he has full control of a situation, in others he will seem weak and ridiculous, struggling in ways that are unbecoming of a pirate of his stature. All those contrasting elements reinforce the idea that Teach is rather unpredictable and somewhat of an enigma, making him similar to series' protagonist
Monkey D. Luffy
to a great extent. It is worth noting that Teach was a rather gloomy and serious individual in his childhood, back when he was nothing more than an orphaned
pirate apprentice
, unlike his more outgoing and expressive adult self.
In general, Teach is perhaps the most realistic depiction of a pirate within the series, showing various degrees of greed, dishonesty, brutality, opportunism and cunning. This is a point Teach has in common with his crewmates for the most part, as they are known for being equally rowdy and violent. Having wild personalities under his command, however, does not bother Teach in anyway, as he believes that a pirate crew is primarily defined by its members being in sync about their goals and agendas, with relationships among personnel being a secondary concern. This means that Teach is willing to welcome in anyone who he thinks could assist him in achieving his objectives, whether they are infamous criminals from
Impel Down
, which is the case for half of his Titanic Captains, former
Warlords
, like
Gecko Moria
, or even former
Marines
, such as
Kuzan
.
Blackbeard has no tolerance for his subordinates' failure towards him such as
Avalo Pizarro
for allowing both
Koby
and
Moria
to escape.
Like many other characters, Teach has a
unique laugh
: "Zehahahahahaha!". This laugh is not present in the English dub until the
Duel on Banaro Island
.
Deceptiveness
Teach is most well-known for his treacherous, long-term plans, having lied and deceived various organizations in order to reach the top of the pirate world. As stated by
Shanks
, Teach is very patient and careful, choosing to lurk in the shadows until the perfect opportunity presents itself, at which point he will quickly act to capitalize on whatever he has set his sights on. As an example, Teach as a child joined the
Whitebeard Pirates
to find the
Yami Yami no Mi
, killing
a crewmate
in cold blood despite having spent two decades aboard the ship. Later, he deceived the Marines by joining the Seven Warlords of the Sea in an elaborate and convoluted fashion for the sole reason of gaining access to Impel Down in order to find new, powerful crewmates.
Marco
considers Teach to be a very ungrateful and deplorable individual.
Though he betrayed the Whitebeard Pirates, Teach does consider the crew he himself formed as comrades to an extent, which is made evident when he was willing to make a trade with the Marines for a battleship big enough to hold all of them comfortably for the sake of one crew member,
Sanjuan Wolf
. Despite his obvious malevolent nature, he can also put up a front of compassion, care, show sympathy and empathy towards his crew's well-being and is willing to take assaults intended for them. However, this apparent kindness does not eclipse his lust for power, as he would have no qualms in sacrificing anyone of his crew in order to save his own skin or obtain a powerful Devil Fruit. In addition, Teach does not care about any allies sailing under his flag, which is in contrast to most Emperors, who tend to retaliate when their subordinates get attacked.
Ambition and Fatalism
Teach is an ambitious, power-hungry man who will bide his time to get whatever he needs in order to become stronger. Having a major interest in
Devil Fruits
, Teach believes that their pros heavily outweigh their cons. As such, he is constantly on the lookout for powerful abilities to steal for himself and his crew, with this ability hunting routine being the backbone of his rule as one of the
Four Emperors
. Teach also seeks to become a
king
, even attempting to negotiate with the
World Government
to make his homebase of Hachinosu an official nation.
Teach's ultimate goal seems to be world domination, as it is the main objective for the missions and aspirations the Blackbeard Pirates undertake under him. Teach will negotiate with powerful adversaries, kidnap high-ranking officers, steal important Poneglyph copies, recruit former high-ranking Marines or even infiltrate Government-controlled islands, as well as confronting high-level World Government operatives, in order to further this goal in the long run.
Teach and Luffy bickering during their first meeting in Mock Town.
Teach, like others who carry the
Will of D.
, has a strong belief in fate and the dreams of men, but unlike the others, is the only one who truly seems to take it to heart. He shares several attributes with Luffy, including having a voracious appetite, a carefree attitude and a love for partying, as well as a competitive and reckless nature to the point of persevering even if there may be grave consequences, and huge ambitions to follow his dream of finding the
One Piece
and become the new
Pirate King
.
Despite that, there is a great contrast between him and Luffy: primarily, Teach fears death whereas other D. carriers embrace it if it comes. Furthermore, when backed into a corner, Teach has shown himself to be a coward: when being held at chokepoint by
Whitebeard
, he pathetically begged for mercy, calling him "Pops" and reminding Whitebeard that he was his "son" and that he could never kill one of his own "family". Just before his death, Whitebeard cryptically noted that Teach was not the one Roger had been waiting for and dismissed Teach as being incapable of continuing
Roger
's legacy.
Perhaps because of his strong belief in fate, Teach is highly amoral. He believes that there is no inherent "good" nor "evil" in the world, jeeringly mocking anyone who expresses such belief. His nihilistic tendencies are in line with the power of the
Yami Yami no Mi
he possesses, which is said to reduce everything to "nothingness".
During his raid on
Impel Down
, he stated that his plans have not gone exactly as expected but is willing to take these surprises in stride and adapt his plans to whatever new circumstance he stumbles into.
Carefreeness and Arrogance
Teach is often very calm, composed, relaxed, easygoing, cheerful, and free-spirited, being often politely sarcastic and mocking towards those around him. He does not seem to hold resentment towards those who wrong him or when a disaster befalls his crew, taking things in stride while laughing in amusement. He is also fond of relaxing and having some leisure every now and then, believing that the pirate life should be fun.
Teach is overconfident and tends to converse and/or taunt his opponents in the middle of battle, having done this in every confrontation he has been depicted in and something Whitebeard once pointed out as a weakness of his. This arrogance often translates into consequences, as he almost always suffers a heavy, painful attack while his guard is down. Since having acquired two Devil Fruit powers, Teach has developed a severe superiority complex, believing himself to be truly invincible and the strongest of them all. Despite his arrogance, Teach does show a sense of caution, and will avoid fighting opponents he views as highly troublesome.
Relationships
Crews
Blackbeard Pirates
Teach with his crew.
In contrast to his obvious malevolent nature, Teach has shown respect and leadership for
his own crew
. He was willing to take the brunt of an enemy attack for them, despite his
Devil's Fruit
's weakness of increasing incoming damage, but that act of selflessness is rare for Teach. In true to his way of letting fate decide things, Teach will often employ his Devil Fruit powers even with his crew still present and at risk of getting harmed by them. Of particular note, when he first gained the powers of the
Gura Gura no Mi
, there was a chance of the plan backfiring and leaving the Blackbeard Pirates with no option but splitting up. However, the crew were more than satisfied with things going this way since they all seem to believe in the power of ultimate fate to some degree. Teach seems to trust his top officers, the Ten Titanic Captains enough to divulge the secret of his special bloodline.
Despite their loyalty towards him, Teach receives a fair amount of casual disrespect from his crew from time to time, especially from the
Impel Down
recruits, but he seems to get over it all save for a few annoyed moments. In general, they all enjoy having fun and hanging out with their leader for parties and drinking sessions. In the end, however, Teach only truly cares about himself as his lust for power always outweighs the well-being of his crewmembers. This is best exemplified by Teach being willing to sacrifice his petrified crew members, including two of his Titanic Captains, in his failed attempt to kill
Boa Hancock
and steal the power of the
Mero Mero no Mi
.
According to
Belo Betty
, Teach does not care for allied pirates who are under his flag, in spite of some of them, like the
Peachbeard Pirates
, using the Emperor's name as a way to intimidate their victims.
In contrary, his subordinates' faith in him is unwavering, as they are convinced, he will ultimately be the Pirate King, ready to do whatever he calls at any given point.
Laffitte
As
chief of staff
of the crew,
Laffitte
often acts as a sort of adviser and messenger to Teach. Laffitte has shown himself to be very loyal to Teach, as he threatened to kill Pizarro for demanding to be captain of the crew, stating that the Blackbeard Pirates are called as such for a reason.
Van Augur
Van Augur
is among the higher ups of the crew likely to call out on Teach's irresponsible and reckless behavior. Despite this, he is loyal to Teach and obeys his orders, while in turn Teach appreciates his talents enough to put Augur in charge of his third ship.
Augur is aware that Teach has many enemies and is protective of him, especially against those who seek an audience with the Emperor.
Doc Q
Teach riding with Doc Q and Stronger.
Doc Q
is one of the original four members to join the Blackbeard Pirates and has served Teach faithfully ever since the beginning. Teach acknowledges his power and even rewarded Doc Q's loyalty by giving him command over the ninth division of the crew. On the other hand, Teach cares little for Doc Q's well-being. He even showed abusive behavior by riding on top of Doc Q and
Stronger
despite his overweight body at one point, although Doc Q seemingly did not mind this treatment.
Jesus Burgess
Teach has enough faith in
Jesus Burgess
' abilities that he gave him the very important mission of acquiring the
Mera Mera no Mi
.
Even after Burgess failed at the task, Teach did not lose confidence in him.
Even though Teach rose up to the rank of Admiral, Burgess still calls him Captain out of habit.
Shiryu
Teach asks Shiryu to join his crew.
Like Augur,
Shiryu
often scolds Teach for his brashness and being too cocky. The two first met during the chaos going throughout Impel Down instigated by Luffy and his
allies
. Seeing that he had no future in the prison and after saving the Blackbeard Pirates from
Magellan
's
poison
, he accepted Teach's offer to join the crew. Teach has enough trust in Shiryu's strength that he made him one of his Titanic Captains.
Sanjuan Wolf
Not much is known about their relationship but Teach sees the
Giant
as a valuable asset and was willing to make a deal with the Marines for a ship that could carry him after the crew's previous ship nearly broke in half due to
Sanjuan Wolf
's massive weight.
Avalo Pizarro
Teach threatens Pizarro for his failure.
Avalo Pizarro
once desired to usurp the Blackbeard Pirates'
captain
role, but now appears keen on pleasing Teach and avoiding doing anything that could upset his operations. He often makes sure to rein in his crewmates and subordinates from causing unnecessary destruction on Hachinosu, sometimes using Teach himself as a threat. This is a result of Pizarro's own fear of his captain, as he was personally threatened by him due to his own failure to stop Koby's and
Moria
's escape.
Still, Avalo dislikes that Teach tends to hog all the worldwide renown due to his Emperor status, and thus seeks to make his own name famous as well.
Vasco Shot
The relationship between Teach and
Vasco Shot
is largely unknown but the two enjoy having drinking sessions together and generally hanging out with the rest of the crew. Shot was one of the crew members who accompanied his Admiral to Amazon Lily to find and kill Hancock in order to steal the Mero Mero no Mi from her. Ultimately, Teach does not genuinely care for Shot as he was willing to leave him petrified if it meant getting Hancock's desirable Devil Fruit. After Shot was unpetrified, he continued to serve Teach, either not knowing or caring that his Admiral was so callous about his well-being.
Catarina Devon
Catarina Devon
was one of the crew members who accompanied her captain to Amazon Lily to find and kill Hancock in order to steal the Mero Mero no Mi from her. Devon stated that she wanted to take Hancock's head as a trophy but Teach told her that she could do so after her abilities were taken from her. Due to Teach's selfish nature, he was willing to leave Devon petrified if it meant getting Hancock's very useful power. On the other hand, due to his "special" lineage, Devon has expressed loyalty to her captain and his goals.
Kuzan
As a former
Marine
Admiral
turned Blackbeard Pirate,
Kuzan
has a peculiar relationship with his now leader.
After clearing up a misunderstanding, Teach asks Kuzan to join the Blackbeard Pirates.
After Kuzan had left the Marines, he and Teach had a chance meeting in the
New World
where, in spite of initial hostility towards each other, both men surprisingly hit it off after spending the night drinking together. Despite Laffitte's suggestion, Teach refused the idea of stealing Kuzan's
Hie Hie no Mi
when he had the chance, and instead invited the former Marine into his crew. While Kuzan was angry, thinking that the Emperor thought he could recruit him after a few drinks, Teach pointed out that the Blackbeard Pirates were not exactly "best friends" and that all of the crewmembers' profit from their own agendas. Therefore, deciding to live his life on his own terms, Kuzan accepted the offer.
Since then, Kuzan has assisted Teach in accomplishing many of his objectives and in defending
Hachinosu
from enemies, all while offering some of his own invaluable experience as a former Admiral to keep Teach in touch with how the Marines operate. Teach gave praise to Kuzan following his capture of Garp.
Whitebeard Pirates
When Teach was orphaned at the age of twelve, he asked to join the
Whitebeard Pirates
during their visit of his homeland, a request that the crew granted without hesitation. However, Teach had already plotted to use the crew for his search for the
Yami Yami no Mi
since then, in his desire to become the next Pirate King. Throughout the next twenty-six years on board their ship, Teach was on very good terms with them, even turning down the chance to be a commander among the crew, although that was most likely a measure not to make himself infamous before he was ready to reveal his plans. Still, the fact that he was not able to discern
Luffy
's relationship with Ace on their encounter (whereas many other Whitebeard Pirates did, as Ace spent much time telling them about Luffy) until it was pointed out by Ace himself showed his own ignorance in regard of his former crew.
Despite all the seemingly great times they once had, and with all the outward respect Teach gave to them, his only reason for even joining the Whitebeard Pirates was just to acquire the Yami Yami no Mi; once he saw it in
Thatch
's hands, he saw no further reason to remain with the crew, and promptly betrayed and murdered Thatch to take the fruit for himself before fleeing. This very action made his former comrades see him as an enemy and a traitor to their crew. Along with Teach mocking them about Thatch and
Ace
's deaths, it only angered them further.
After Teach had murdered his former captain with a nine-on-one attack, he utilized the knowledge and experience he gained from the crew to arrogate Whitebeard's status of Emperor and annex nearly all of his territories, further showing how in the end Teach merely exploited the crew who had once accepted him as family.
One year after the Summit War of Marineford,
Marco
and the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates confronted the Blackbeard Pirates in the "Payback War" and were ultimately defeated. This event was what led Teach to be recognized as one of the Four Emperors.
Edward Newgate
In spite of being given a place to stay by
Whitebeard
while he was a young orphan, Teach seemingly never considered his former captain as anything more than a stepping stone to achieve his true objectives. This is best evidenced by the fact Teach had zero qualms in desecrating Whitebeard's dead body in order to steal the
Gura Gura no Mi
for himself.
Teach admitted at
Marineford
that he respected and admired Whitebeard until age caught up to the latter, but considering Teach's subsequent actions, it is unknown if this was his true feelings about his former captain or a form of mockery. At the very least, Teach did think highly of Whitebeard's status, as the latter's strength and influence were cited as reasons to believe he had the highest chance of stumbling into the
Yami Yami no Mi
, leading to Teach's continued membership under the Whitebeard Pirates.
Whitebeard admitted he had a bad feeling about Teach and at first tried to prevent Ace into pursuing him, thinking his former son was more trouble than he had let on. During the
Summit War of Marineford
, Whitebeard himself refused to acknowledge Teach as family and attacked with no mercy, pointing out Teach's weaknesses and carelessness while doing so. Whitebeard also believes that Teach is not the person that
Gol D. Roger
seemingly predicted would succeed him as the next Pirate King, cryptically saying that his traitorous subordinate was "not the man Roger was waiting for".
Portgas D. Ace
Teach was
Portgas D. Ace
's subordinate in the second division of the Whitebeard Pirates. Because of this, Ace felt responsible for Thatch's murder and sought to take matters on his own hands by finding and then punishing Teach for his crimes against Whitebeard and his family.
Originally, Ace and Teach had a friendly relationship, with Ace respecting Teach's seniority as a Whitebeard crewmember and thinking the latter was more deserving for the job of second division commander (which had been left vacant since
Oden
left the crew). Instead, Teach thought Ace had the necessary "ambition" to take the position and encouraged the newcomer to fill the vacancy. Even after leaving the Whitebeard Pirates, Teach still referred to Ace as "commander", implying he still somewhat respected Ace as his superior despite being enemies.
After Teach deserted the crew, Ace went on a great search for his former subordinate, eventually finding him at
Banaro Island
following some stolen Marine intel. There, Teach attempted to convince Ace into joining his crew, but this promptly backfired (especially after Ace learned Teach was hunting
Luffy
as well). The two then went on to fight each other, with Teach winning and then handing the defeated Ace over to the
World Government
in exchange for becoming one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
. As such, Teach had a great contribution on Ace's eventual death, with many like
Luffy
and
Marco
acknowledging him as the primary responsible for it.
Enemies
Straw Hat Pirates
Teach has been an enemy of the
Straw Hat Pirates
ever since he and his crew encountered them in
Mock Town
. His first act against them was when he tried to collect the bounties of two of the crewmembers, but he failed thanks to a timely
Knock Up Stream
. All of the Straw Hats greatly despise Teach for the huge role he played in Ace's death.
Monkey D. Luffy
Teach and Luffy.
Both being firm believers in fate and dreams, Teach originally gave
Monkey D. Luffy
sound advice on being a pirate, but Teach later attempted to capture Luffy for his second bounty but failed to do so. When he learned of the latter's third increase, Teach attempted to go after him again, but Ace caught up to him before he could accomplish his task. Teach was surprised to learn Luffy was Ace's brother and the latter fought him to protect Luffy.
In their second meeting, Luffy was shocked to see him, but later becomes angered when learning that Teach was the one who put Ace on his path towards death. Luffy himself almost forgot his original mission to save Ace and attacked Teach, only stopping because of
Jinbe
's intervention. While Luffy calmed his mind, Teach had realized he underestimated Luffy as he found his strength impressive. Teach did not stop Luffy from attempting to rescue Ace, going so far as to say to give it his best and reminding him of the words he said when they first met. The pair are considered enemies and with Ace's death taken into account, Luffy's hatred for Teach increased immensely. Despite this, Teach still seems to hold a strong respect for Luffy seeing that he is a fellow "dreamer" with an aspiration to find the
One Piece
and become the Pirate King.
Two years later, when Teach was speaking to Burgess (through a
Den Den Mushi
) at the
Corrida Colosseum
, the latter told him of Luffy's presence which intrigued him as he greeted the young pirate who was angered to hear him. Teach spoke to Luffy with a jovial tone telling him that Burgess would win the tournament and claim the
Mera Mera no Mi
before Luffy firmly told him that he would not allow them to claim his brother's power.
Luffy's hatred for Teach increased after learning that the Blackbeard Pirates had attack
Baltigo
(the Revolutionary Army's base of operations), which placed his father Dragon and brother Sabo in danger.
Despite being enemies, Teach has become something of a fan of Luffy as he was simply ecstatic when he heard of the chaos Luffy and his crew caused on
Enies Lobby
.
When news of the Straw Hats' actions in
Totto Land
spread across the world, Teach was deeply amused by the fact that Luffy challenged
Big Mom
, though he stated it was too soon for him to be called an Emperor.
After hearing about the war in
Wano Country
, Teach showed even more excitement for Luffy's upcoming
clash
with
Kaidou
.
Jinbe
Teach appears to know
Jinbe
, having commented on his friendship with Ace. Jinbe was enraged at Teach for causing Ace's arrest and death sentence by the Marines but was cautious about his disposition and abilities.
After the Summit War of Marineford, Jinbe kept tabs on Teach as he informed Luffy of Teach's usurping of Whitebeard's Emperor status and his relentless hunt for Devil Fruit users to absorb their abilities. He warned Luffy that Teach would consider the Straw Hats to be invaluable targets.
It is unknown if he is aware that Jinbe has joined Luffy's crew.
Trafalgar D. Water Law

Following
Big Mom
and
Kaidou
's downfalls, Teach attacked
Law
at
Winner Island
, in an attempt to steal his
Road Poneglyph
copies. Teach mocked Law for not being more welcoming to a fellow member of the
Worst Generation
, and Law was not intimidated by the idea of fighting Teach.
It is known that they were both involved in the
Rocky Port Incident
, but unknown at what capacity, except that Law was seemingly familiar with Teach beforehand.
Teach defeated Law in battle and told him that the one hundred pirates that had their hearts stolen by the Surgeon of Death during the incident would be elated if he were to do the same to him. Teach also held interest in Law's
Devil Fruit
, the
Ope Ope no Mi
, being aware of its more outlandish applications like the perennial youth surgery. Teach however let Law escape from his grasp due to
Bepo
's surprise
Sulong
transformation, something that frustrated him.

bears a grudge against Teach for his role at triggering the Whitebeard War by defeating and handing over Ace to the World Government for the vacant Warlord of the Sea position. Later, this intensified after Teach defeated the
Bonney Pirates
in the
New World
, leaving Bonney and her crew helpless.
Bonney does not seem to fear Teach, and even went as far as insulting him in front of his crew. Teach offered her to become "his woman"—not knowing she is really a
child posing as an adult
—but she refused and struck him while at it, something Teach did not appreciate due to feeling that was improper behavior for a lady. When
Akainu
arrived to deal with Teach, the latter lost his interest on Bonney and went on the run.
World Government and Marines
Teach joined the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
after defeating Ace and handing him over to the
World Government
. However, Teach exploited the benefits the Warlord of the Sea title granted him in order to enter facilities that would otherwise have been unreachable to an ordinary pirate. Teach only wanted to be a Warlord of the Sea so as to be able to reach Impel Down in order to liberate several Level 6 prisoners and bolster the ranks of his crew.
He stole a Marine ship with his crew, using it to break into Impel Down. After he had achieved this goal, he resigned from his Warlord of the Sea title upon reaching Marineford.
Teach made enemies of the Marines after revealing his treachery when he went to Marineford during the Whitebeard War. The Marines hold themselves accountable for not only the potential power he wields, but also for the number of dangerous criminals he freed from Impel Down. Sengoku personally was furious over the latter's betrayal and took it upon himself to fight Teach when he bragged about sinking Marineford. Despite all this, Teach later tried to trade Bonney for a Marine battleship, which the Marines did not go through with, sending Akainu to deal with him instead.
Two years later, Teach once again attempted to negotiate with the Government, by capturing the famous
Koby
and using him in exchange for
Hachinosu
to be recognized by the Government as a legal country for criminals. Even after being rebuffed by Koby being a
SWORD
member, Teach intended to press on with his attempt, being interested in seeing how the world will react if Koby is disavowed by the Marines.
The
Five Elders
are aware of Teach's special lineage, which they consider to be particularly notable.
Koby
Teach holding Koby captive.
Teach is appreciative of Koby's actions during the
Rocky Port Incident
which helped Teach defeat
Ochoku
and become the ruler of Hachinosu.
After Koby surrendered himself to Teach in exchange for 800 Marine hostages,
Teach wanted to use Koby's status as a hero to pressure the World Government into accepting his demands to turn Hachinosu into an official country. Seeing value in having Koby around for negotiations, regardless of his official status as a Marine, Teach kept Koby alive, but imprisoned in a cell on Hachinosu. After Koby escaped,
Avalo Pizarro
forbade any of their subordinates from killing Koby for this very reason.
Magellan
Teach seemed aware of
Magellan
's infamy as he was expecting to confront
Impel Down
's warden at some point after invading the prison. Magellan, meanwhile, treated Teach like he would any intruder, quickly dispatching him so he could focus on the mass breakout that was happening at the time.
Shanks
Shanks
and Teach first met around 26 years ago after a skirmish between their respective crews, but they kept their distance from each other back then.
Teach at the very least did not seem to think very highly of Shanks at the time, remarking that he and
Buggy
looked unimpressive despite their shared roles as
apprentices
for their crews.
Nowadays, Shanks has a watchful eye out for Teach, making sure to gather intel, monitor his movements in the
New World
and trying to guess where he could appear at any moment. Although the exact events are unknown, Shanks previously admitted to Whitebeard that his facial scar came from a direct attack from Teach, being the only injury, he ever took that truly bothered him.
Even at Marineford, Shanks addressed Teach in a tense manner, being the only one to regard Teach as a massive threat compared to the Marines or the Whitebeard Pirates, who otherwise prioritized clashing against each other. Having already proclaimed "his era" was beginning, unveiling the new members of his crew and demonstrating control over two Devil Fruits, Teach said he had achieved his goal for the time being, while also stating that it was not yet time for his battle with Shanks.
Gecko Moria
They had no interaction when Teach was a Warlord of the Sea, though
Gecko Moria
was amused to be informed that the latter filled the vacant position left by
Crocodile
.
In an attempt to rescue
Absalom
, Moria attacked
Hachinosu
and demanded that Teach show himself. Even after Moria had attacked his underlings, Teach still gave Moria the option to join him though he did so derisively.
Moria was eventually imprisoned at some point after this encounter, implying he rejected Teach's proposal.
Boa Hancock
Teach subdues Hancock in front of Koby.
Teach invaded
Amazon Lily
in order to kill
Boa Hancock
and steal her
Mero Mero no Mi
. He apprehended her while she was off guard when she was about to attack
Koby
. While grabbing Hancock by her throat, Teach was aware of Hancock's trickery that is if he let her go, she would eventually turn him into stone and easily kill him. Due to Hancock being dangerous, he attempted to kill her and steal her Devil Fruit by choking her. This was until he spared Hancock's life and left Amazon Lily due to
Silvers Rayleigh
's arrival, as well as Hancock warning Teach that if he killed her and stole her powers, his petrified crew members would remain petrified forever although he did tell her that he does not even care about his crewmates.
Hancock (much like Luffy) holds an immense hatred towards Teach and considered him as her mortal enemy when she told him to "get his filthy hands off of her", showing her disdain for the Emperor. Even when Teach was initially choking the life out of her, Hancock refused to submit herself to the likes of him.
Silvers Rayleigh
Teach and
Silvers Rayleigh
have been enemies for a long time, where Rayleigh made it clear that he never liked Teach. Rayleigh arrived at Amazon Lily to stop Teach in his attempt to kill Hancock and steal her Devil Fruit. Teach had no intention to fight Rayleigh and decided to leave Hancock alone and retreat from Amazon Lily due to Teach's fear of Rayleigh. On the other hand, Rayleigh admitted Teach would eventually beat him in an actual confrontation due to the former's advanced age, acknowledging that Teach had grown into a veritable threat.
Monkey D. Dragon and the Revolutionary Army
Teach became enemies with
Monkey D. Dragon
and the entire
Revolutionary Army
after
Sabo
defeated Burgess at
Dressrosa
. Sabo, in particular, hates Teach and his crew for their responsibility in Ace's capture that led to his eventual death, something that helped fuel his thrashing of Burgess as the latter mocked Sabo's own inability to save him at the time.
Teach and his crew invaded
Baltigo
and destroyed the Revolutionary Army's main headquarters in an attempt to steal their weapons and retrieve a wounded Burgess (who had managed to stow away into a Revolutionary ship), until the Blackbeard Pirates were forced to retreat due to the Marines and
CP0
arriving at the scene. After the conflict, Dragon and his army relocated to
Momoiro Island
.
In spite of being enemies, Teach was excited to hear that Sabo and the three commanders of the Revolutionary Army had faced off against Admirals
Fujitora
and
Ryokugyu
in
Mary Geoise
to rescue
Bartholomew Kuma
from the
Celestial Dragons
.
Teach seems to hold them in some regard, as he had Laffitte keeping tabs on their actions following the clash on Baltigo.
Charlotte Pudding
Blackbeard held Pudding captive
Teach sent his crew to capture
Big Mom
's 35th daughter,
Charlotte Pudding
and bring her to him. Pudding declares to Teach that if Big Mom was alive, she will make him pay for capturing her, but he and his crew mocked her believing that Big Mom was dead. Blackbeard wrapped his arm around Pudding much to her chagrin and disgust.
Other
Caribou
Caribou
is a fierce admirer of Teach. His dream is to join his crew. Caribou claims he has valuable information for Blackbeard. Hearing about this, Teach let Caribou come to him, but if the information he had was not good enough, Teach would execute him.
Abilities and Powers
As one of the
Four Emperors
, Teach is one of the four most powerful pirates in the world, proof of this would be having received a bounty of
2,247,600,000 during the timeskip
and would later increase to
3,996,000,000 for unknown reasons, which is the second highest among the current Emperors.
Also, as the
admiral
of the Blackbeard Pirates, Teach has absolute authority over the crew, with the crew itself staffed with extremely powerful and infamous individuals. Furthermore, as the current ruler of
Hachinosu
, he has dominion over the entire island.
Even before gaining any devil fruit powers,
Jinbe
stated that he was still a fearsome individual at that time when he was a member of the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
As great evidence of this, is that during this time he fought
Shanks
and left scars on his left eye; and although the exact circumstances of what happened are not known, Shanks declared that it was not due to carelessness, recognizing Teach as a dangerous threat.
Likewise,
Portgas D. Ace
, before officially becoming 2nd division commander of the crew, believed that Teach could have become commander, but the latter refused.
He managed to kill
Thatch
, the 4th division Whitebeard commander and escape from the
Moby Dick
and Whitebeard's territory seemingly with relative ease.
After gaining the powers of the
Yami Yami no Mi
, Teach managed to take on his former commander, Ace, another powerful
Logia
user. Such was his confrontation that many of the witnesses who witnessed it declared that his power was not of this world.
When he defeated Ace and handed him over, the
World Government
quickly recognized his victory, so they granted him the position of
Warlord of the Sea
despite not having a bounty or reputation at the time.
After the
Summit War of Marineford
, the
Five Elders
believed that Teach had a huge lead ahead of anyone else to usurp the position of Emperor once held by
Whitebeard
.
This predication came true after Teach and his crew managed to overwhelmingly defeat
Marco
and all the remaining members of Whitebeard's crew, officially becoming the new Emperor.
Two years later, Teach has become even more powerful, as he easily defeated his fellow ex-Warlord,
Boa Hancock
, and even
Silvers Rayleigh
, the former "Right Hand of the
Pirate King
", confessed that he would stand no chance against the Emperor due to his elderly age.
Another testimony of his might is that he was able to defeat
Trafalgar D. Water Law
, a fellow member of the
Worst Generation
, who is also another ex-Warlord, has a bounty worth
3,000,000,000 and one of the two pirates responsible for defeating former Emperor
Big Mom
.
Likewise, veteran pirate
Chinjao
who usually looks down at the Worst Generation believes that Teach has potential to greatly influence the pirate world.
Tactical Skills
Teach arrives at Marineford with his new crew after successfully orchestrating the events leading to the
Summit War of Marineford
.
Teach has shown himself to be an expert planner and a master at orchestrating manipulative schemes provided he has time to prepare; he waited two decades aboard the Moby Dick with the
Whitebeard Pirates
and even integrated with the crew dynamic solely to increase his opportunities of obtaining the
Yami Yami no Mi
(and also recruited some future members of his own crew during this time, indicating great charisma and leadership skills even as a regular crewmate).
He also went to capture Monkey D. Luffy to guarantee an offer for the vacant position of the Seven Warlords of the Sea by the
World Government
, which in turn was simply sought for free access through the
Gates of Justice
into the notoriously impenetrable
Impel Down
to recruit mighty Level Six prisoners to strengthen his crew. This scheme completely deceived both
Sengoku
and
Tsuru
, the two greatest strategic masterminds of the Marines, with Sengoku realizing Teach's true intentions only after the Blackbeard Pirates had appeared in Marineford.
Marco also suggested Teach had already made plans to steal the
Gura Gura no Mi
, from being on the crew for so long. Instead of taking Whitebeard head-on to steal his Devil Fruit, Teach effectively manipulated Whitebeard and the entire military force of the Marines, including the
Admirals
Akainu
,
Aokiji
, and
Kizaru
, into fighting each other during the former's attempt to rescue Ace. Eventually, Whitebeard became fatally injured and weakened enough for Teach and his crew to brutally overpower and ultimately kill Whitebeard to steal the Gura Gura no Mi, becoming the first person to wield two Devil Fruit powers. When confronted by Shanks and his
crew
, Teach instead had his crew retreat as he deemed that it was not the right time to fight them, which showed a great sense of caution. This side of him was seen again when he chose to flee from Marine Admiral Akainu. Later, in an attempt to steal the
Road Poneglyph
rubbings, Teach set a trap for whichever of the three crews left
Wano Country
and headed to
Winner Island
.
Following his victory over the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates, Teach used his previous knowledge of the latter's territory to conquer most of it, becoming one of the Four Emperors.
However, for all his combat prowess and intellect, Teach can be overconfident and careless, as noted by Whitebeard. He has a habit of concentrating too much on conversations with his opponents while fighting them, letting his guard down in the process, a weakness he has demonstrated in his battles against Whitebeard,
Luffy
, Ace,
Magellan
, and
Law
. This usually results in him suffering critical injuries. In fact, if not for
Shiryu
's help, Teach and his entire crew would have been killed by Magellan's
poison
.
Physical Abilities
Teach withstanding an attack from Luffy, despite the handicap of his own devil fruit.
Teach has an immense amount of superhuman endurance and durability. During his fight with Ace, he was engulfed in flames and pierced in the chest by two
fire spears
, but after putting out the flames, he was able to shake off the impact of the attacks.
Another indication of his sheer endurance is shown when he took a
Jet Pistol
from an enraged Luffy,
and was hit by one of Sengoku's shockwaves in his
Daibutsu
form only to come out with minor injuries both times.
Teach also shows an incredible tolerance to pain as, despite his Devil Fruit greatly amplifying the pain he receives, this never stops him for long, demonstrated when he took a point-blank
quake bubble
attack from Whitebeard to his head and neck without losing consciousness. He shrugged off a kick to the head from
Supernova
Jewelry Bonney
,
took a direct slash from Whitebeard's
bisento
without suffering any lasting damage,
and quickly recovered after having his insides fried by Law's
Shock Wille
.
According to Marco, Teach has a unique body structure that is different from other
humans
, which could even explain how he was able to possess two Devil Fruits,
while any individual would have normally ended up dying. This is further shown when
Buggy
stated that Teach did not need to sleep like other people. It is rumored that Teach has never slept once in his whole life, which shows off his tremendous stamina.
Teach also possesses tremendous physical strength, even for his comparable size, as demonstrated when he seriously injured Luffy and Ace, both of whom are exceptionally durable, with just one hit, sending them crashing back with incredible force and across great distances. He was able to stop an enraged Whitebeard's
quake
attack with his own physical strength and with the help of his
Kurouzu
technique.
Devil Fruits
Teach, wielding the powers of both the Yami Yami no Mi and the Gura Gura no Mi.
Through an unknown method, Teach became the first and so far, only known person to wield the powers of two
Devil Fruits
at the same time.
Marco
speculated that this was possible due to an unstated peculiarity unique to Teach himself, having to do with an "atypical body structure" of some sort. He also pointed out that the other Whitebeard Pirates should be aware of this fact.
With the power of darkness (the Yami Yami no Mi), which "reduces anything to nothingness", and the power of earthquakes (the Gura Gura no Mi), which "brings destruction to everything", Teach claimed himself to be truly invincible and the strongest of them all.
Teach has since attempted to acquire other additional Devil Fruits such as
Boa Hancock
's
Mero Mero no Mi
and later
Trafalgar D. Water Law
's
Ope Ope no Mi
, though it is not known if he has acquired any more abilities yet or how many he has in total.
Yami Yami no Mi
Further information:
Yami Yami no Mi
Teach using Kurouzu.
Teach ate the Yami Yami no Mi, a unique
Logia
-type Devil Fruit
which allows him to create, control, and transform his body into darkness. The darkness appears reminiscent of a fiery black smoke while also bearing a resemblance to a liquid. Unlike a normal Logia user, Teach cannot turn intangible; in fact, any damage he takes will actually hurt worse than normal.
Teach has an infinite amount of space inside of his body made of darkness.
The darkness has strong properties of gravity and absorption. The darkness has the power to pull things in, much like a black hole. Even light itself cannot escape. Furthermore, the gravity is so strong that it can completely crush anything in its path. Once something has been pulled in, it can be absorbed into the darkness, where it will be trapped until Teach himself decides to release it. It is described as a void which devours everything and returns all to nothingness.
The most frightening power of the fruit is that it allows Teach to absorb/nullify other people's Devil Fruit powers. So long as Teach maintains physical contact with the other Devil Fruit user, it is as if the victim never ate their Devil Fruit at all.
Gura Gura no Mi
Further information:
Gura Gura no Mi
Teach using the power of the Gura Gura no Mi.
Teach, through currently unknown means, stole the power of the Gura Gura no Mi from the dead body of its previous user,
Whitebeard
. The Gura Gura no Mi is a
Paramecia
-type Devil Fruit that gives him the ability to cause earthquakes and generate powerful shockwaves. It is considered to be the strongest power of the Paramecia class, in addition, it is said that it has the power to destroy the entire world.
He has the power to send incredibly powerful shockwaves through the air, creating cracks in the air itself in the process. By striking at the general area with his quake powers, he can cause large earthquakes. His quakes cause serious damage and alterations to the surrounding landscape and are capable of destroying buildings.
He can also "grab" the surrounding area and literally tilt it, he can even do this with not just an entire island, but also the surrounding seas. He unknowingly caused a tsunami at a
nearby island
when he first tried this.
In the anime, he has also displayed the ability to use his shockwaves defensively, as their vast raw power can easily stop incoming attacks, even from the
Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit power
of the then-Fleet Admiral,
Sengoku
.
Upon initially obtaining the power, he did not have great control over it.
After the timeskip, he seems to have more control of the power, as he casually created an earthquake with no effort.
Haki
Main article:
Haki
Observation Haki
Teach is a highly skilled user of
Observation Haki
. As he was able to sense that
Luffy
's bounty of
30,000,000 was too low compared to his strength,
and during his raid on
Impel Down
he was able to sense that Luffy's Haki had improved since meeting him in
Jaya
.
Armament Haki
Teach uses Armament Haki to guard against S-Hawk's attack.
Teach is an extremely skilled user of
Armament Haki
.
By hardening his arm, he was able to defend himself against
S-Hawk
's sword slash, which could cut
Amazon Lily
's large mountain in half.
Weapons
Teach's tekkō-kagi weapon.
Teach has occasionally been shown using tekkō-kagi weapons, one of which he favored since his youth days. It is also the weapon he used to give Shanks his facial scars.
When the Whitebeard Pirates started protecting
Fish-Man Island
, he was seen with longer tekkō-kagi in one hand.
He has yet to been seen wielding a claw weapon in the present day, however.
Teach used a
flintlock pistol
when dealing the deathblow to Whitebeard along with the other Blackbeard Pirates,
and also has three pistols tied in his sash.
His accuracy with them is not completely shown, as he was only seen emptying his ammunition into Whitebeard at point-blank range, yet Whitebeard was still briefly alive after he had finished shooting.

Anime and Manga Differences
While the manga has never depicted how exactly Teach killed Thatch, the anime shows that Teach literally stabbed him in the back.
In the anime, the fight between Teach and Whitebeard is slightly extended, as Teach punched Whitebeard several times while having the latter in his grip. He also shot Whitebeard in the heart with his flintlock and fired several more times before ordering his crew to join in. In the manga, he simply ordered them to attack right after surviving one of Whitebeard's quake bubbles. Also, the wound he received from the Whitebeard's bisento was not as brutal as it was in the original manga. In the manga, the Yami Yami no Mi was in Teach's left hand and the Gura Gura no Mi was in his right. In the anime, they are reversed.
In the anime, the fight between Teach and Sengoku is also extended, with the former's quake punch and the latter's shockwaves tearing apart Marineford. Sengoku knocked Teach back with another shockwave, but he retaliated by tilting the island just as Whitebeard had done. Jesus Burgess jumped into the fight to assist but was knocked back by the intervention of Garp.
When Teach shifted the seas, the tsunami saved the Heart Pirates from a naval bombardment and a longer scene of people escaping Sabaody Archipelago is shown.
Translation and Dub Issues
Name and Epithet
Initially, the "Teach" portion of his name was romanized
Teech
in all official English translations—the
VIZ
manga,
Funimation
-dubbed anime and Simulcast subtitles, and
4Kids
' localization of the video game
Pirates Carnival
. This is an accurate transliteration of the katakana
(
ティーチ
?
)
used in the original Japanese, albeit weaker in the intended allusion to the historical pirate
"Blackbeard" Edward Teach
.
Interestingly, all of Funimation's home-releases of the anime render the name as
Teach
, in both subtitles and translations of on-screen text. In contrast, the VIZ manga continues to favor
Teech
.
For a time, some minor debate also existed—similar to that surrounding
Whitebeard
—as to whether
Blackbeard
was the "proper" translation of the epithet
Kurohige
(
黒ひげ
?
)
, as
Hige
(
髭
?
)
is a generic term for facial hair that applies to both mustaches and beards, and Teach had virtually no beard during his first few appearances. However, this became moot from the
Impel Down Arc
on, when Teach began wearing a prominent beard.
Laugh
During his earliest appearances in the
Jaya Arc
, the Funimation dubbed anime made no attempt to adapt his
distinct
"Zehaha"
laugh
. However, from the
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
on, the laugh was generally retained.
Other
In the original manga and anime, Teach comments
"I'd thought thirty million too low for his
Haki
"
(
あの覇気で３千万はねえと思ったが
?
)
on seeing Luffy's updated bounty. However, both the Funimation anime and the VIZ manga translate this line with
"even thirty million"
, producing the opposite implication: that Teach (much like the
Bellamy Pirates
) had thought Luffy was not even worth his pre-Arabasta bounty.
(Notably, this line was also the first to explicitly name
Haki
. As the term's significance would not be revealed until the
Amazon Lily Arc
, neither Funimation nor VIZ acknowledge it in their respective translations.)
Inspirations and Influences
Oda's rendition of the real-life Blackbeard from
SBS Volume 49
.
Teach is, in many aspects, designed as a fictionalized version of "Blackbeard" Edward Teach, possibly the most notorious pirate in (Western) history and
Eiichiro Oda
's personal favorite pirate.
In addition to his name, epithet, and general viciousness, Teach's in-story history parallels his historical counterpart's in several areas:
Initially unknown, he rises to utter notoriety within three years (the historical Teach was active as "Blackbeard" for only three years, from 1716 to 1718).
His rise is facilitated by the betrayal of a fellow pirate (the historical Teach acquired many men and at least one ship by usurping the authority of fellow captain
Stede Bonnet
; by some accounts, Bonnet was, much like
Portgas D. Ace
, arrested and executed while trying to pursue revenge).
He has sought
government
authorization
, if only temporarily (the historical Teach, in addition to probably originating as a
privateer
, briefly accepted a pardon from
North Carolina
governor
Charles Eden
in 1718).
After the
timeskip
, Teach has also begun wearing a long, multi-braided beard—an element common to nearly all contemporary descriptions and illustrations of the historical Teach.
Two related characters would derive looser inspiration from the historical Teach:
"Whitebeard" Edward Newgate
took on his given name, while
Thatch
took on an alternate spelling of his surname (also reported by some sources as a deliberate alias).
Early Concepts
Early concepts of Teach from
One Piece Green
.
In
One Piece Green: Secret Pieces
, an early concept of Teach was revealed, including that he was originally named
Everything D. Teach
(
エブリシング・
D
・ティーチ
,
Eburishingu Dī Tīchi
?
)
.
His original name may be taken from the 17th century English pirate
Henry Every
, famous for becoming the richest pirate in the world at the time and getting the highest bounty in history placed on his head.
