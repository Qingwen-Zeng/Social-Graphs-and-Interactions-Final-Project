Momoo
is a giant sea cow from the
Grand Line
, and the first
Sea Beast
seen in the series.
He is classified as a Type A creature, "Big Friendly".
Originally, he was utilized by the
Arlong Pirates
as a method of intimidation towards the residents of the
Conomi Islands
. After Arlong's defeat, he was captured and employed as a draft animal by the
Caribou Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Momoo is a giant sea cow with a seal-like structure, with a height of 36 meters (118'1" feet) and weighing 16 tons (32,000 lbs). Despite having fish-like scales covering his body from his neck to his stomach, Momoo is classified as a mammal
Sea Beast
. These scales are actually his hardened skin, protecting his vital organs from external attacks as an armor.
He has a big, round nose with a gold nose ring, cow-esque face, horns, and green spots throughout his body.
Besides helping him swim, his fins contain retractable bones sharp enough to act as claws.
Personality
[
]
Like most pirate
pets
, Momoo is very simpleminded, and spends most of his waking time focused on either food or obeying those he recognizes as superiors. As a carnivore of great size and strength, he has no qualms about eating any
humans
who approach him. However, he is easily intimidated by those he cannot overpower, and developed a severe phobia of the
Straw Hat Pirates
in particular after receiving multiple beatings from them, particularly Luffy and Sanji.
His behavior has not changed even after two years. After seeing the Straw Hats again during the journey to
Fish-Man Island
, he quickly fled in terror,
but the
Caribou Pirates
easily forced him to turn back by giving him a lump on the head.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Momoo is strong enough to destroy an entire village, as seen with
Gosa Village
.
Momoo (as other sea cows) also has the strength to overturn ships while searching for food. He has a well-developed sense of smell, allowing him to lurk on the bottom of the sea and emerge at once to attack his target without giving them time to react.
Due to his gigantic fins, he can swim as fast as 70 km/h (43,5 mps). The hardened skin on his body serve as an armor, protecting him from external attacks. Momoo can also swallow his prey whole. His four stomachs (just as a normal cow has) are full of various bacteria and parasites that actively digest whatever he eats. Thus, Momoo won't suffer any damage even if he eats a highly poisonous animal.
History
[

Past
[
]
Momoo was allegedly found somewhere in the
Grand Line
by
Arlong
and
his crew
, though the exact circumstances remain unknown. During the Arlong Pirates' reign over the
Conomi Islands
, Momoo was housed in a small underwater cave near
Arlong Park
, with
Hatchan
—who could summon him with a loud, trumpet-like call—serving as his main caretaker.
While normally left to his own devices, Momoo was occasionally called to act as an extra enforcer for the Arlong Pirates. Notably, he participated in their attack on
Gosa Village
, leaving it completely leveled and crisscrossed with a number of deep furrows.

Sanji tries to feed Momoo.
Several weeks after the attack on Gosa, Momoo encountered
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Sanji
, and
Yosaku
, having followed the smell of cooking-smoke to
their ship
. His sudden appearance panicked Yosaku, but only annoyed Luffy, who immediately punched him for imposing on their lunch. Subsequently, Sanji took pity on Momoo's hunger and willingly surrendered some of their food, but delivered an even harsher beating when Momoo tried to eat him too. Before he could escape, Momoo was harnessed to their ship and forced to tow them to
Arlong Park
.
Although he made good time overall, Momoo succumbed to exhaustion during the last part of the journey, and veered off toward
Cocoyasi Village
instead.
Before he could be redirected, Momoo crashed headfirst into the coastline, knocking himself unconscious and violently (albeit non-fatally) flinging the Straw Hats' ship into the woods outside Cocoyasi.
Later in the day, when the Straw Hats launched an all-out attack on Arlong Park, Hatchan summoned Momoo to fight for the Arlong Pirates. Upon seeing Luffy and Sanji, the still-injured Momoo immediately tried to flee, but was stopped by
Arlong
, who overrode his fear through sheer force of personality and forced him to attack. This attack was in vain, as Luffy easily overpowered Momoo again and
spun him around mercilessly
, using him to bludgeon most of Arlong's forces before tossing him clear to the other side of Arlong Park.
Momoo made no further appearances for the rest of the fight, and was apparently forgotten by both the Straw Hats and his own crew; it is unknown what reaction, if any, he had to Arlong's defeat.
Fish-Man Island Saga
[

Fish-Man Island Arc
[
]
Some time after the fall of Arlong Park, Momoo wandered away from the East Blue and into the waters near the
Sabaody Archipelago
, where he was captured by the
Caribou Pirates
. They used him as a means of advanced sea navigation. By putting a collar around his neck, they could hook him to the front of the ship, allowing him to pull them.
Nami recognizes Momoo.
After moving the Caribou Pirates' ship close to the
Thousand Sunny
,
Momoo recognized
Nami
, Sanji, and Luffy. Frightened, he swam away, pulling the ship with him and leaving
Caribou
alone on the Thousand Sunny with the Straw Hat Pirates.
Momoo later returned at full speed and pulling Caribou's ship with another lump on his head. When the
Kraken
destroyed the ship, Momoo was freed from the Caribou Pirates' control and swam away.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
His name is an obvious reference to the "mooing"
(
モー
,
Mō
?
)
sound made by cows, though it should be noted that Japanese pronounces this onomatopoeia with a "long"
o
-sound, rather than the "short"
o
used in English. Thus, the Japanese anime pronounces his name
"Mohm"
(indeed, the katakana used to spell his name are identical to those used to render the English name
Maugham
), while both the
4Kids
- and
Funimation
-dubbed anime pronounce it
"Moo-moo"
.
