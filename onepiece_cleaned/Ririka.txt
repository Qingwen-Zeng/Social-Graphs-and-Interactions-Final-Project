daughter
to get inside and get away from Luffy. She then asked Rika if she had gone to the execution grounds again, which her daughter denied.
After
Morgan
was defeated, Ririka thanked Luffy and
Roronoa Zoro
for saving
Shells Town
by treating them to a meal at her home. She happily carried away empty dishes while the two and
Koby
ate. The
Marines
later arrived at the house and ordered the
pirates
to leave the town. Ririka watched in concern as Koby and Luffy punched each other and Koby vehemently denied being a pirate. As Luffy and Zoro sailed away, the townspeople and Marines cheered for them.
