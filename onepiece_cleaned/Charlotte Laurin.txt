He also wears a single dark grey glove on his right hand.
Personality

Not much is known about Laurin's personality, however, since he took part in
Big Mom
's plan to assassinate the
Vinsmoke Family
and helped his crew chase after the
Straw Hat Pirates
, he can be considered very loyal to his family and crew.
He was very surprised by
Capone Bege
's betrayal.

and wedding between

's plan to assassinate the

broke
Mother Carmel
's portrait, Laurin worried about Big Mom's reaction.
When

revealed his true intentions, Laurin was shocked and confused.
He later joined his
crew
's siege on the alliance.
As the alliance tried to escape, Laurin was blown away from
Monkey D. Luffy
and Big Mom's clash.
As the

toppled as a result of the
