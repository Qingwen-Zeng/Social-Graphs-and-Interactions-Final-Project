brother
after he was defeated by
Monkey D. Luffy
.
He and Cadenza personally attacked Luffy with Cream Punch while he was distracted by
Charlotte Mont-d'Or
, defeating him. When Luffy refused to move, Counter knocked him out by stomping on his back 5 times before taking him captive.
Later, Luffy escaped from his prison cell and while rampaging throughout the chateau, he strangled Counter while demanding Sanji's whereabouts.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
As a fatigued and starving Luffy approached the place on the outskirts of Sweet City where he promised to wait for Sanji, Counter surprised him with a sneak attack. Luffy fought back, but his attacks were ineffective. After knocking Luffy to the ground, Counter stomped on him.
When Luffy got back on his feet, Counter continuously pummeled him mercilessly and smashed him into the ground. Upon seeing Luffy on his feet, Counter prepared to finish him off. As he charged towards Luffy and punched him in the face, Luffy mustered enough strength to stand his ground and deliver a punch to Counter's face as well.
Counter retaliated and after exchanging a few more blows with Luffy, Counter fell unconscious.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
While racing through the Whole Cake Chateau searching for Sanji, Luffy choked Counter in the manga. In the anime, a confrontation between Luffy and Counter in the Whole Cake Chateau did not occur and Luffy choked Cadenza instead. However, Counter has another confrontation with Luffy after the latter left Sweet City to return to the place where he promised to wait for Sanji.
Despite being hungry and weakened, Luffy managed to defeat Counter after a harsh struggle.
