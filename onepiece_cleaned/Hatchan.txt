Hatchan
,
nicknamed "
Hachi
"
(
ハチ
,
Hachi
?
)
, is an
octopus
fish-man
who was an
officer
of the
Arlong Pirates
before their defeat,
and a member of the
Sun Pirates
before that.
After the rest of the Arlong Pirates were arrested, Hatchan was the sole member to escape,
and went on
many adventures
which ended in him opening a floating
takoyaki restaurant
and meeting up again with the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
He was one of the major antagonists of the
Arlong Park Arc
. He is also the central character of the
Hatchan's Sea-Floor Stroll
Cover Page Serial. Later, along with
Camie
, he is one of the main supporting characters of both the
Sabaody Archipelago
and
Fish-Man Island Arcs
as an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Hatchan, being an octopus fish-man, has eight appendages (six arms and two legs) and an octopus-like face. He has pink skin and grey hair styled into five spikes. By the time he had become a takoyaki salesman, he had a second row of spikes. He has a muscular build and suction cups on his six arms, which he can use to cling on to walls. Hatchan has a tattoo in the shape of a sun on his forehead, as a result of being in the
Sun Pirates
.
While most fish-men have webbed hands, octopus fish-men do not, as neither Hatchan nor Octopako have webbed hands.
When first arriving at Cocoyasi Village, Hatchan wore a diamond-checkered outfit.
In the Arlong Arc, he wore a striped outfit.
Hatchan usually wears heavy clothing and shirts made especially for octopus fish-men. During the Sabaody Arc, he wore a jacket to cover his four extra arms and a bandage to cover his tattoo to prevent him from being captured and sold at the
Human Auctioning House
.
When the Straw Hats arrive at Fish-Man Island, Hatchan wears a shirt from the
Criminal
brand.

Personality
[
]
Hatchan is not very intelligent and can be easily duped, such as when he failed to recognize who
Roronoa Zoro
really was, and mistakenly begins to introduce himself while asking other people their names. He initially fails to understand Zoro's words during his battle about the difference in "weight" between their swords (he assumed Zoro meant weight as in "heavy", but Zoro was referring to weight as in "burden"). In his fight against Zoro, he made many misjudgments and even at some points allowed himself to get angry, which partly contributed to his defeat.
By the time he meets the Straw Hats again near Sabaody Archipelago, his personality seems to have changed. He seems to be significantly more intelligent and very knowledgeable about the Sabaody Archipelago, though it is likely because he is quite familiar with it (he thought Duval and Sanji looked the same and was still easily tricked by Sanji into revealing his true identity), and wisely cautions Luffy against provoking the World Nobles in spite of their cruelty.
He has also become very ashamed for what he and the Arlong Pirates did to Nami and her village and is genuinely sorry for what he did. Since then, he has tried to atone for all of his past sins.
Hatchan is also rather humble in comparison to other fish-men, often accepting that things are how they are and not wanting to upset others.
He seemed to respect Arlong as a friend, going as far to support his ambitions by willingly joining his crew, a band of fish-men who hate humans, despite Hatchan himself not particularly despising or discriminating against humans.
Hatchan is extremely kind and caring, as he frequently protected Camie and Pappag from being abducted by the Macro Pirates. During his time as a member of the Sun Pirates, he also restrained Arlong when he violently assaulted Koala out of annoyance. Hatchan also readily helped a town of catfish who were suffering from a famine by selling all his newly acquired treasure to buy cooking equipment and ingredients to feed them. Due to his kindness, Hatchan recognizes humans by their character instead of their race, as during his childhood, he saved Rayleigh from drowning in a shipwreck, becoming close friends with him and his wife Shakuyaku ever since. While he supported Arlong as his crewmate, Hatchan personally never engaged in any sort of cruel abuse towards the people of Cocoyasi Village like the rest of the Arlong Pirates, and even Nami vouched that Hatchan was the better one of the Arlong Pirates and that they should save him.
Hatchan's childhood dream was to be accepted into the human society, and he admitted that Arlong's tyranny was going too far. Unlike
Kuroobi
and
Chew
, Hatchan alone was not corrupted by Arlong's ideals.
After Luffy accepted Hatchan as a friend, he outright opposes Arlong's ideals, much to
Hody Jones
' disappointment.
Relationships
[
]
Friends
[
]
Sun Pirates and Arlong Pirates
[
]
Hatchan is good friends with
Kuroobi
, having known him since childhood, a time when they shared a dream to open a takoyaki stand. He befriended a former slave named
Koala
. Hatchan kindly reminded her that she was no longer a slave and that she did not need to clean floors like a servant and played games with her to try and cheer her up. Like many members of the Sun Pirates, Hatchan cried over Tiger's death.
Hatchan was also very loyal to Arlong, since he had been his crewmate even before Fisher Tiger formed the Sun Pirates. After the Sun Pirates separated into smaller fractions, Hatchan went with Arlong's crew.
He was formerly friends with
Macro
,
Gyaro
, and
Tansui
of the
Macro Pirates
, having known Macro from his times as a Sun Pirate, until he destroyed their ship for supposedly selling him a fake map.
Jinbe
also showed concern over Hatchan's well-being, despite the former Warlord feeling guilty of releasing the Arlong Pirates into East Blue.
Camie and Pappag
[
]
Hatchan with Pappag and Camie.
After escaping from a prison ship, he befriended
Camie
and
Pappag
, and ran a Takoyaki stand with them. Since then, he is very close with the two. Both Camie and Pappag care for Hatchan's well being. When Hatchan was shot by Charlos, Camie was horrified and desperately tried to help him, while Pappag tended to Hatchan with Chopper.
Rayleigh and Shakuyaku
[
]
He is also well acquainted with
Silvers Rayleigh
, whom he saved from a shipwreck as a child. Since then, the two were on good terms, though they fell out of contact after Hatchan joined
Fisher Tiger
's
Sun Pirates
.
Hatchan knew
Shakuyaku
for twenty-two years, but they have not spoken to each other since twelve years before the current storyline. Hatchan treasured his friendship with the pair, as he would tell the young children of the
Fish-Man District
about his association with humans who were accepting of him.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Hatchan was originally an enemy of the Straw Hats when they fought against Arlong for
Nami
's sake. During that time, he bore a grudge against Zoro for tricking him, and volunteered to fight him himself. The newer members of the crew (Chopper, Franky, Robin and Brook) are unaware of what happened, though, until
Usopp
explained it. He managed to befriend the
Straw Hat Pirates
after they saved him while he was held hostage by the
Flying Fish Riders
, despite being one of their old enemies. After that, Hatchan has been on friendly terms with them, serving them Takoyaki and guiding them throughout Sabaody Archipelago. At first, Nami stated that she had not forgiven him but later saw that Hatchan was honestly trying to atone for what happened.
Hatchan attempts to stop Luffy from attacking a World Noble.
Luffy called Hatchan a friend and protected him from one of the World Nobles. After this, any lingering animosity the crew had towards him has all but vanished after he helped them. While the Straw Hats were scattered all over the world for two years, Hatchan helped protect the Thousand Sunny until he was too injured to continue. During an argument with Hody Jones, Hatchan mentioned that Luffy called him a friend and explained that he could not bring himself to face him as long as Hody followed Arlong's legacy.
Enemies
[
]
Marines
[
]
While a member of the Sun Pirates, Hatchan fought against the Marines when they were after Fisher Tiger's head for assaulting Mary Geoise. After the fall of the Arlong Pirates, Hachi was arrested alongside the crew, and was to be sent to prison. However, he alone managed to escape the Marines' ship.
Macro Pirates
[
]
The Macro Fish-Men Pirates also harbor a grudge against him for destroying their ship and saving Camie. The Macro Pirates would attempt to kidnap Camie time and time again only to have their plans foiled by Hatchan.
New Fish-Man Pirates and Flying Pirates
[
]
He made enemies with the New Fish-Man Pirates and the allied
Flying Pirates
due to siding with humans.
Hody Jones
and the other fish-men who follow Arlong's ideals all lost respect for Hatchan, as they believed his friendship with humans to be disgraceful. With Hatchan unable to sway Hody Jones,
Vander Decken IX
used him for a demonstration of his "curse". Hatchan, much like Jinbe, is well aware that Hody's ideals and methods make him even more dangerous than Arlong ever was.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Hatchan spitting out ink.
Hatchan can shoot streams of ink from his mouth like a true octopus in order to blind enemies, allowing him to strike them down while they cannot see. He also covered himself with the ink in a failed attempt to conceal his identity from the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Hatchan has a massive amount of strength as one of the top members of the Sun Pirates and an officer of the Arlong Pirates. He easily defeated the
Macro Pirates
, who were fish-men themselves, single-handedly and sent them flying with three-armed punches. His strength allows him to easily wield six extremely heavy cutlasses, each weighing over 300 kg, while maintaining speed. Even when injured, he was the only fish-man from the Arlong Pirates to escape from the Marines. He is also aware of the existence of
Haki
, but admits that he knows very little about it.
As a fish-man, Hatchan is an expert swimmer. Even as a child, he managed to save Rayleigh from drowning at sea during a shipwreck. Even after being seriously injured during the timeskip, resulting in him using crutches, Hatchan still displayed great swimming prowess and was able to swim a considerable distance before being struck down by the barrage of arrows that Decken
sent
at him after he marked Hatchan as his target.
Hatchan seems to have incredible endurance, as he was able to survive getting slashed by Zoro's three swords and Sanji's kick. Hatchan also got up sooner than any of the other
fish-man
after getting beaten by Zoro. However, he had an advantage in both cases, as Zoro had been badly injured by Mihawk and Sanji's kick was under water, reducing his power and speed. Even when pierced by Decken's arrows and experiencing heavy blood loss, Hatchan still managed to swim back to Fish-Man Island to warn the Straw Hats of Hody's invasion.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Further information:
Six Sword Style
Hatchan is a highly skilled
swordsman
and a master of the Six Sword Style. As an Octopus Fish-Man with six arms, Hatchan can simultaneously wield six swords with great dexterity and versatility. He has stated that he is the second-best swordsman in all of Fish-Man Island.
Hyouzou
stated that if Arlong did not have a "tight-wallet", he would not have settled for Hatchan. If he was still the second strongest swordsman on Fish-Man Island during the Fish-Man Island Arc, then he has become the strongest swordsman after the Energy Steroids made Hyouzou's body old and weak. Even Zoro had trouble when he fought him and barely won (though he was greatly limited by the wound he sustained from
Mihawk
). Using Six Sword Style, Hatchan could cut down members of the Flying Fish Riders while they were flying in mid air. For two years, Hatchan could fend off the Marines to protect the Thousand Sunny with Duval, the other members of the Rosy Life Riders, and Bartholomew Kuma.
In the anime, he was able to create a tornado by flailing his swords wildly, similar to Zoro's Tatsumaki.

Weapons
[

Each of his swords is a
cutlass
that weighs over 300 kg (661.387 lbs), totaling to over 2 tons worth of metal, which is far more than a normal human's limit.
During his
adventures
, Hatchan was given a golden trident by the
Goldfish Princess
for returning her ring.
He showed proficiency in its usage by defeating a sea monster that was chasing a
Sea Boar
.
Culinary Expertise
[
]
Hatchan is a highly skilled chef, having once roasted an entire pig to feed the Sea Cow Momoo. He is particularly masterful in cooking takoyaki, with his takoyaki being deeply appreciated by the
Straw Hat Pirates
, including Sanji, a master chef. Hatchan cooks takoyaki with great speed and dexterity. With his six arms, he could make large numbers of takoyaki to feed the Straw Hats, particularly Luffy, who has an enormous appetite.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Early life
[
]
Hatchan was friends with
Kuroobi
since childhood, and they dreamed of opening a Takoyaki stand. Hatchan was with
Arlong
,
Chew
, and Kuroobi when they saw the
Sabaody Ferris Wheel
.
22 years ago, when Hatchan was 16 he saved Silvers Rayleigh from drowning in a shipwreck.
Some time after
Gold Lion Shiki
's escape from
Impel Down
, Hatchan visited Shakky's bar. Shakky offered Hatchan a drink when he found Rayleigh reading a
newspaper
about Shiki's escape.
When he grew older, he joined the
Arlong Pirates
, which was basically a group who bullied the islanders for siding with Otohime's speech of promoting inter-species relationship. After
Fisher Tiger
attacked
Mary Geoise
, became an enemy of the World Government, and formed the Sun Pirates, the Arlong Pirates integrated with Tiger's crew.
During his time as a Sun Pirate, he befriended Macro and worked his way up the crew. Hatchan's main contribution to the Sun Pirates was to alert the crew of enemy ships. The Sun Pirates later visited an island where a former slave of Mary Geoise named
Koala
resided.
The inhabitants there had no way of returning the girl to her homeland, so they asked the Sun Pirates to take her. Hatchan befriended Koala and tried to encourage her to stop cleaning floors like a servant.
Eventually, the Sun Pirates returned Koala to her home,
Foolshout Island
. However, not long after Koala returned to her family, the Sun Pirates were ambushed by
Marines
led by
Rear Admiral
Strawberry
.
In the ensuing battle, Fisher Tiger was badly wounded, and the Sun Pirates lost their ship, having to use a captured Marine ship to escape. On board the stolen Marine ship, the Sun Pirates tried to save Tiger's life with a blood transfusion using human blood, but Tiger firmly refused the transfusion. When Fisher Tiger died, Hatchan grieved over his death.
After Arlong was captured trying to avenge Tiger, Hatchan found himself under the command of Jinbe. One day, Jinbe received an invitation to join the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
. After Jinbe accepted the position, Arlong was released much to the joy of Hatchan. When the Sun Pirates split up, Hatchan went with Arlong's crew, though looking back with some apparent reluctance.
Service Under Arlong
[
]
Hatchan as a member of the Arlong Pirates.
Hatchan became an officer and the caretaker of
Momoo
, the Sea Cow of the
Arlong Pirates
. Originally, Arlong wanted to take
Hyouzou
into the crew as his swordsman, but could not afford his price and settled on Hatchan instead.
The Arlong Pirates then headed for
East Blue
and invaded
Conomi Islands
, immediately subjugating
Cocoyasi Village
. After Arlong killed
Bell-mère
, Hatchan went into her house and found a map.
Nami
charged at him, telling him that it was her map, which she drew herself, and demanded it back. Arlong read the map and was amazed at her talent and ordered Hatchan to bring her with them. Hatchan grabbed Nami and went to where
Arlong Park
would stand.
East Blue Saga
[
]
Arlong Park Arc
[
]
Ten years later, after
Arlong
finished a meeting with the
Marines
from the
16th Branch
, he called for Hatchan to ferry the Marines back to their ship. Hatchan commented on how
Captain
Nezumi
's mouse face made him laugh, for which Arlong scolded him. Hatchan then went on to escort Nezumi out of
Arlong Park
in his Octopus Pot.
Afterwards, Arlong and some of the crew went to Cocoyasi Village in pursuit of
Usopp
. Hatchan remained behind to roast a pig for
Momoo
. He called out for Momoo with his mouth as a horn, but Momoo did not come.
Roronoa Zoro
, who was in Arlong Park, noted the call and found Hatchan. Unknown to Hatchan, Zoro had recently struck down his crewmates. Thinking Zoro was a guest, Hatchan escorted him to Cocoyasi to find Arlong.
Upon returning to Arlong Park, Hatchan was surprised to see so many of his comrades injured, prompting him to swear revenge. However, when
Kuroobi
asked him if he had seen someone like Zoro, Hatchan started to describe the guest's appearance, finally realizing the guest's true identity, much to his comrades' chagrin. He then started to explain himself that he believed Zoro to be one of Arlong's guests. The fish-men then watched as Nami beat up and stabbed Usopp, much to the crew's delight.
Later, a Marine squad from the
77th Branch
, under
Commodore
Pudding Pudding
, came to rescue the
Goza
citizens, but decided to attack Arlong Park.
Chew
,
Kuroobi
, and Hatchan went to handle them. Hatchan's job was to move a cliff under the Marine ship, which passed over it with tremendous speed (thanks to Kuroobi), causing a maelstrom that sank the ship.
After Nezumi took Nami's money, Nami stormed into Arlong Park and accosted Arlong, but the crew laughed when Arlong pointed out that he had not broken their deal.
Monkey D. Luffy
broke down the gates of Arlong Park.
When Zoro, alongside Usopp and
Sanji
, showed up as well, Hatchan immediately recognized him. Once again, he called forth Momoo, only to find it with a giant bump on its head and a severe fear of Luffy and Sanji, who had previously beaten it. After Luffy used the Sea Cow to defeat most of the crew, the fish-men officers prepared to fight the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Hatchan started off the fight by firing a jet spray of ink at Luffy (who had stuck himself into the ground order to defeat the lesser fish-men), before slamming a piece of debris at him, only for Sanji to destroy it with a single kick. As Hatchan attempted another debris throw, Zoro taunted the fish-man into throwing it at him instead of Luffy. The debris missed, and they were interrupted when Arlong stood up and threw Luffy into the water.
Hatchan then squared off against Zoro. He had the advantage at first due to Zoro's previous injuries from
Dracule Mihawk
, making Zoro unable to fight at full strength. Zoro charged at Hatchan, cutting his hair after the fish-man ducked from the incoming blow. After an unsuccessful attempt at catching Zoro's sword, Hatchan clung himself to the roof of Arlong Park, intending to stall Zoro, making it difficult to rescue Luffy. However, Zoro soon collapsed due to his wound, prompting Hatchan to rapidly punch the pillar he stuck himself to in an attempt to crush Zoro beneath it. However, Zoro responded by throwing Hatchan beneath the crumbling structure, before collapsing once again. Hatchan then emerged from the rubble, now wielding six swords for his
Six Sword Style
in order to vanquish Zoro for humiliating him. However, Zoro was undaunted and asked
Johnny
and
Yosaku
to lend him their swords in order to use his
Three Sword Style
.
Hatchan vs. Roronoa Zoro.
Johnny and Yosaku threw their swords towards Zoro, but because of his increasing fever, he was unable to move to catch them. At this moment, Hatchan attempted to cut Zoro into pieces with his Six-Sword Style, but Zoro reversed it with his
Toro Nagashi
, repelling all of Hatchan's swords whilst cutting the fish-man's abdomen. Enraged, Hatchan tried to explain that his six swords automatically outrank Zoro's three swords. However, Zoro responded by saying that his swords are heavier than Hatchan's. Not understanding what Zoro meant, Hatchan performed a pot-stance attack on Zoro, who blocked it. Hatchan then released the swords from their stance, allowing him to land a devastating headbutt to Zoro's chest, reopening the wound from Mihawk.
Hatchan sent flying by Zoro's
Tatsu Maki
.
While Zoro was in the air, Hatchan started spinning his blades in an attempt to grind Zoro into pieces once he came in contact with them. However, Zoro managed to masterfully evade every single blade whilst cutting the fish-man's hands. Enraged, the fish-man attempted the pot-stance again, but it was repelled by Zoro's
Oni Giri
, which destroyed all of his swords. Smiling, Zoro asked Hatchan if he knew what he meant when he said that his swords were heavier than Hatchan's. In one last attempt to defeat Zoro, Hatchan tried to punch Zoro into submission, but this was stopped by Zoro's
Tatsu Maki
, which sent him flying. Defeated, Hatchan wondered how three swords could beat six swords before slamming into the ground.
However, after Kuroobi and Chew were defeated by Sanji and Usopp, respectively, Hatchan pushed himself back up, refusing to let humans win.
Briefly stunned out of fear of Usopp's rubber band, Hatchan then dove into the water in order to stop Sanji from helping rescue Luffy. At the bottom of the sea, Hatchan encountered Sanji and
Nojiko
. In a last-ditch effort to stop them, Hatchan tried to punch Sanji with his multiple arms, but Nojiko swam in the way of the punches. Because of all the movement, Hatchan's wounds re-opened, stopping him from harming her and allowing Sanji to release Luffy.
The officers were later arrested by the Marines.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Hatchan's Sea-Floor Stroll
[
]
Shortly after Arlong's defeat, Hatchan was brought on a Marine prison ship. He escaped and decided to go home to
Fish-Man Island
. He initially did some simple good deeds, including removing a hook from a
panda shark
, giving food (which was given in gratitude by the panda shark he rescued earlier) to a stranded islander, and finding a ring for the
Goldfish Princess
. Gaining a trident from the
Goldfish Empire
, he used it to stab a monster attempting to eat a sea boar.
Hatchan meets Camie and Pappag.
After saving the boar, it unexpectedly spat out a
mermaid
named
Camie
and a starfish named
Pappag
, whom Hatchan befriended with little problem. However, he later betrayed Camie when the
Macro Pirates
gave him a map to help him find the artifacts needed to create his most prized talent: takoyaki. Unfortunately, the map merely directed Hatchan to the giant octopus
Mash
, whom he defeated, but this did not help him towards making his takoyaki.
Feeling betrayed by the Macro Pirates and soon encountering a saddened Pappag still wanting Camie back, Hatchan attacked their ship and reunited the starfish and mermaid. When he returned to Mash, he discovered that the creature helped him after all: inside his mushroom-shaped hat (which opens like a lid) was a massive jar of the best takoyaki-cooking sauce.
Taking the octopus, the sauce, and a ton of treasure stolen from the Macro Pirates, Hatchan continued his journey until he arrived at a town of catfish, ruined and desolate and particularly hungry. Hoping to help them out, Hatchan sold off all his treasure for cooking equipment and a cart, using it to create enough takoyaki not just to help the catfish but to propose to
Octopako
. Octopako turned him down, but the catfish were grateful and in love with the takoyaki created by Hatchan.
While originally dejected by his initial failure, but with some encouragement from Camie, his original dreams, and a new ship built in gratitude by the catfish, Hatchan decided to stay true to himself. In the end, he decided to open up a new floating takoyaki stand
Takoyaki 8
, with the mermaid and starfish occasionally helping on support.
Summit War Saga
[

Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
Hatchan captured.
When Camie and Pappag disappeared again, Hatchan mistakenly believed Macro had captured them, so he went to confront them. The Macro Pirates had teamed up with the
Flying Fish Riders
and together they defeated and captured Hatchan.
Upon hearing that the Straw Hat Pirates were coming with Camie for a rescue, Hatchan panicked, fearing that the crew, particularly Nami, would still hold a grudge against him, so when the pirates arrived, Hatchan attempted to conceal his identity by coating himself with his ink. Unfortunately, his voice was recognized by Zoro along with his silhouette and even Nami found him suspicious. Sanji tricked the fish-man into admitting his identity by asking him about Arlong. When the Straw Hats found out that he was the Hatchan that served Arlong, they changed their minds about rescuing him. Hatchan actually encouraged this, warning the crew it was a trap and that they should leave him, but Nami decided to rescue Hatchan because he was harmless, and they had already made a promise with Camie.
Hatchan battles the Flying Fish Riders.
After being freed by Zoro, Hatchan effortlessly punched Macro and his crewmates away from the island, before finally sort of reconciling with Zoro, who had just moments ago saved Hatchan, Camie, and Pappag from an incoming Flying Fish Rider.
Later, Hatchan aided in the fight against the Flying Fish Riders using his Six Sword Style, mainly protecting
Brook
and Zoro while they were recuperating, before the pair returned the favor.
Duval
, the leader of the Flying Fish Riders then crashed out of a building while riding
Motobaro
, which forced Hatchan and the Straw Hats to flee.
When Duval had his Fish Riders capture Sanji and pulled him into the sea, Hatchan prepared to go after Sanji, but the Flying Fish were faster than the fish-man underwater. However, Camie was even faster and managed to free Sanji from his trap. Upon resurfacing, Sanji, with Luffy's help, defeated Duval.
Afterwards, Hatchan, Camie, and Pappag returned to the Takoyaki 8 and served the Straw Hats free takoyaki as promised. Even though the situation got a little tense when Hatchan asked Nami how it was, she replied that even though she had not forgiven the fish-man, she found the takoyaki tasty, which was more than good enough for him. Duval visited the restaurant to thank the Straw Hats and to offer his help if they ever need it. After all the cooking, Hatchan was exhausted, so Sanji invited aboard the
Thousand Sunny
for tea. There, they discussed the Straw Hats route to the
New World
and needing to stop at
Sabaody Archipelago
before heading down to
Fish-Man Island
.
Hatchan accompanied them to Sabaody Archipelago and offered to have a
Coating
specialist he knew to prepare the ship for its descent. After explaining the layout of the groves, he warned the pirates to be cautious of the
World Nobles
and not to defy them.
After covering up his tattoo and extra arms, Hatchan carried Camie as they accompanied the Straw Hats through the Archipelago. They rented multiple
Bon Chari
to ease travel between groves. While Hatchan and Luffy were racing each other to Grove 13, they witnessed
Devil Dias
' failed attempt to escape slavery, and Hatchan had to hold Luffy back when Saints
Shalria
and
Rosward
passed by and shot Dias.
Hatchan and his companions enjoying Sabaody Park.
After the Straw Hats successfully fought off groups of bounty hunters, Hatchan brought them to
Shakky's Rip-off Bar
and introduced them to
Shakky
, who offered them free food and drink because they were friends of Hatchan's. However,
Silvers Rayleigh
had been away from the bar for six months, and Shakky suggested he might be in
Sabaody Park
, which excited Camie and Luffy.
The group then visited the amusement and enjoyed the various rides and treats. However, their fun ended when the
Hound Pets
kidnapped Camie so they could sell the mermaid into slavery.
While Sanji called in and coordinated with the Rosy Life Riders (formerly, Flying Fish Riders), Hatchan and Luffy began searching shops selling slaves but were unsuccessful. Distraught, Pappag regretted bringing Camie to the amusement park and explained to Luffy about the known discrimination of fish-men and merfolk in Sabaody Archipelago. However, Luffy refused to believe that Hatchan and Pappag did anything wrong and promised to save Camie. Three Rosy Life Riders then arrived to pick them up.
As they were searching across the archipelago, word went out that Camie was at the
Human Auctioning House
, so the Rosy Life Riders raced them to Grove 1. When
Franky
tried to blast through the side door, Hatchan warned him that World Nobles were inside, and that Camie would be wearing an explosive collar. Nami reasoned that they would have to win the auction for Camie, so Hatchan, Pappag, Nami, Chopper, and Franky entered through the front entrance.
However, before they could make a bid, the World Noble Saint
Charlos
bid
500,000,000, crushing any hopes of rescuing Camie that way and frustrating Hatchan more.
Hatchan shot by Saint Charlos.
When Luffy and Zoro crashed through the door, Hatchan tried to hold Luffy back from racing to the stage and accidentally revealed his extra arms. The crowd was disgusted by the fish-man's presence. Saint Charlos then shot Hatchan and believed that he could take the fish-man as an additional slave for free. As Luffy advanced towards Charlos in anger, Hatchan attempted to stop Luffy from harming the World Noble, claiming that as he had been a pirate, this was exactly what he had deserved. He also added that all he wanted to do was to make up for what his former crew had done to Nami these past eight years and apologized for not being unable to screw things up, which moved Nami to tears. However, when Charlos tried to shoot Hatchan again, Luffy ruthlessly punched the World Noble in the face,
much to the shock of everyone in attendance.
Nami rushed over to Hatchan's side, while the other Straw Hats took out the guards and Zoro cut open the water bowl containing Camie. Before Saint Shalria could shoot the mermaid, Rayleigh stepped out of the back and knocked the Noble unconscious with
Supreme King Haki
. Hatchan and Rayleigh were surprised and delighted to see each other again. Rayleigh then used his Supreme King Haki on the room, incapacitating everyone but the pirates.
Rayleigh then removed Camie's handcuffs and explosive collar without harming her, Chopper dressed Hatchan's injuries, and Rayleigh checked up on the fish-man. When the pirates went to fight the Marines outside, Rayleigh carried Hatchan
and followed the Straw Hats through the battle.
They safely returned to Shakky's bar, where Chopper continued treating Hatchan's injuries.
Hatchan promised to guide them to Fish-Man Island once Rayleigh finished coating the Thousand Sunny. The fish-man remained behind to recover at the bar when the Straw Hats went off to spend their three days in the archipelago.
When news reached the bar that
Admiral Kizaru
was after the Straw Hats, Hatchan assured Camie that their friends were strong, but Shakky pointed out that they would need more than strength in the New World.
Post War Arc
[
]
After the
Summit War of Marineford
, Hatchan, Camie, Pappag, Shakky, and the Rosy Life Riders stood guard over the Thousand Sunny, and Duval fought off the
Coffee Monkeys
, who wanted to steal the ship and sell it to the Marines. Hatchan discussed with Camie and Pappag about the places on Fish-Man Island that the Straw Hats should visit, with Hatchan suggesting the
Fish-Man Karate Dojo
. They all panicked when the
Warlord of the Sea
Bartholomew Kuma
showed up.
During the Timeskip
[
]
One year after the Straw Hats' separation, the Marines located the Thousand Sunny and attempted to destroy it. Hatchan, Duval, the Rosy Life Riders, and Bartholomew Kuma fought a great battle against the Marines in an effort to protect the Thousand Sunny. Hatchan and Duval sustained serious injuries and were forced to retire, leaving Kuma to guard the ship.
Before the Straw Hats reunited, Hatchan returned to the
Fish-Man District
at Fish-Man Island to recover from his injuries.

An injured Hatchan trying to reason with Hody Jones.
Unwilling to go see Luffy until Arlong's legacy of hatred was stamped out, Hatchan went to
Noah
and attempted to talk the
New Fish-Man Pirates
out of using the
Energy Steroids
, attacking Fish-Man Island, and destroying the
current regime
.
Hody Jones
expressed his disappointment in him, who he thought had fallen so far from Arlong's ideals. Hatchan also called out
Hyouzou
and
Vander Decken IX
for having ignored Arlong's recruitment but following Hody's command. Hyouzou explained that Arlong was too cheap to afford him at the time and that he only cares about being paid and not the cause of his employers, while Decken pointed out that he is Hody's equal in their alliance and then demonstrated his
Mato Mato no Mi
ability by throwing a dagger over Hatchan's shoulder, and it turned around and stabbed the octopus fish-man's back. When Decken threw a sheaf of arrows up into the air, Hatchan ran for his life and tried to swim away. However, the arrows cut up to him and pierced his back and arms.
Hatchan remained conscious long enough to reach
Coral Hill
and warn Chopper and Sanji of the upcoming attack.
As Chopper administered to Hatchan's wounds, the doctor and Sanji were met with accusations from the Fish-Man Island citizens for mermaid kidnappings. Hatchan refused to tell Chopper and Sanji about who was responsible for his wounds and kept telling them to leave Fish-Man Island. While hovering above Coral Hill on top of
Megalo
, Luffy spotted them and jumped down to meet them. After Megalo spat out
Shirahoshi
,
the Fish-Man Island citizens stated that the Mermaid Princess was being kidnapped and tied up Hatchan and his friends. Their celebration was interrupted by the arrival of Decken. After Luffy pummeled Decken and
Wadatsumi
, Hatchan and the group headed towards the
Sea Forest
on top of Megalo.
They soon reached the Sea Forest where the group got acquainted with Franky,
Den
, and
Jinbe
. Jinbe was surprised to see Hatchan, who was supposed to be captured with the Arlong Pirates. Nami and Camie soon arrived bearing terrible news about Hody's rampage in the
Ryugu Palace
. As Camie went to Hatchan's side, Jinbe decided to explain the situation as quickly as he could. Hatchan then listened to Jinbe with a worried look as the former Warlord of the Sea revealed that he himself was the one responsible for allowing Arlong to run wild in the East Blue.
While having a conversation with Jinbe, Nami explained that she noticed that Sabaody Park resembled Arlong Park. Hatchan stated his regret for Arlong's brutality and said that ever since he and Arlong were kids, they wanted to be part of the human world. Hatchan went on explaining the humans' continued hatred towards fish-men and some history such as Fish-Man Island becoming a member of the
World Government
and the beginning of the Great Pirate Era. When Hatchan finished, Jinbe proceeded to explain the ideals of Queen
Otohime
and Fisher Tiger.
After Jinbe finished his story, Hatchan was overjoyed to hear Nami saying that she forgave Jinbe and that she does not hate fish-men kind as a whole. Hatchan began explaining Hody's plans but was interrupted when a visual
Den Den Mushi
appeared and broadcasted Hody's speech.
After Hody explained his plan of creating a new Ryugu Kingdom, which included executing King
Neptune
, Shirahoshi was about to go back with Megalo, but Jinbe stopped her. Hatchan also told the princess not to go since Hody was using Neptune as a hostage to safeguard against
her ability
to summon
Sea Kings
.
While Luffy and Jinbe argued over how they should deal with Hody, Sanji asked Hatchan if Hody was the one who gave him his wounds, but Hatchan did not give a straight answer. Jinbe came up with a plan that would make Luffy look like a hero instead of a villain. When Jinbe explained his plan, Hatchan and Camie agreed with Jinbe.
Hatchan, Camie, and Den remained in the Sea Forest as Jinbe and the Straw Hats battled against the New Fish-Man Pirates.
After the battle for Fish-Man Island ended, Hatchan, Den, and Camie were shocked to see Sea Kings bringing Noah to the Sea Forest. Hatchan was later seen attending the banquet at Ryugu Palace with the Straw Hats.
Hatchan, Camie, and Pappag bidding the Straw Hats farewell.
After the celebrations were over, he was seen with Camie and Pappag, bidding the Straw Hat Pirates farewell. Hatchan proclaimed that he would help repair the
Candy Factory
before the pirates sailed away from Fish-Man Island.

Early Concepts
[
]
Early concept of the Arlong Pirates from
One Piece Green
.
In
One Piece Green: Secret Pieces
was revealed in an early concept of the Arlong Pirates that Hatchan would have originally been a squid fish-woman. Her name was supposed to be
Maple Read
(
メイプル・リード
,
Meipuru Rīdo
?
)
.
Also, in Buggy's original crew there was a messenger bird named Hachi. This character was scrapped and its name later became Hatchan's nickname.

Anime Differences
[
]
Hatchan and his companions encounters Luffy time before the battle at Arlong Park.
In the manga, Hatchan's attempt to feed call
Momoo
(and by extension Momoo's encounter and battle with Luffy's group) took place after Zoro had defeated the minor subordinates of the
Arlong Pirates
that were still at
Arlong Park
. In the anime this takes place sooner before Zoro was brought to Arlong Park following his capture.
In the anime,
Luffy
, while on a walk, encounters Hatchan,
Kuroobi
, and
Chew
, who are examining the remains of
a boat
that recently crashed around
Cocoyasi Village
. Hatchan happily sends Luffy on his way after he answers a few questions, though Kuroobi is surprised that Luffy was not intimidated by their appearance.
This encounter would later cause Hatchan to recognize Luffy after he goes to face Arlong.
Live-Action Differences
[
]
"Hachi" from the
live-action series
.
A fish-man who replaces Hatchan appears in the
seventh
and
eighth episode
, played by Jarid Norman, credited under Hatchan's nickname, Hachi. He appears as the fish-man playing cards with and losing to Nami. However, this fish-man more closely resembles a pufferfish more than an octopus and is missing Hatchan's iconic face tattoo. He also resembles another member of the Arlong Pirates that appeared next to
Kaneshiro
in
Chapter 72
and appears in
One Piece Color Walk 1
crew concept art named
Ishidai
(
いしだい
?
)
.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
"Hachi"
(
ハチ
?
)
is a name of some popularity in Japan, though it is most commonly given to pets (
e.g.
Hachikō
) or stage personas; in kanji, it
corresponds to
several different terms, most notably—and appropriately for an octopus—the number eight
(
八
?
)
. Meanwhile, his full name "Hatchan"
(
はっちゃん
?
)
is paradoxically designed to seem like a nickname ("-chan"
(
ちゃん
?
)
being a suffix commonly used to make names seem "little" or "cute").
4Kids'
condensed version of the
Arlong Park Arc
—in addition to the standard blood/violence edits—cuts some of his more dimwitted moments, such as his fear of
Usopp
's rubberband.
