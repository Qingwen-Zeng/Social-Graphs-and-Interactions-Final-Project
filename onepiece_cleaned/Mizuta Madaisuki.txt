Entering the Grand Line
[
]
A long time ago, the Mizuta Twins joined the Rumbar Pirates. They, along with the rest of their crew, met
Laboon
, a young whale who got separated from the rest of his pod and followed the ship due to loneliness. The twins journeyed through the
West Blue
with their ship mates, fighting other pirates and singing music.
Eventually, the crew came upon
Reverse Mountain
, where they met
Crocus
. After staying at the crossing for three months and having fun, they decided to venture out into the
Grand Line
, leaving Laboon behind with Crocus.
A Sad End
[
]
After visiting a forested island, the
captain
,
Yorki
, became very ill. Madaisuki, with the rest of the crew, then witnessed their captain leave to prevent the disease from spreading.
At some point, the Rumbar Pirates engaged in a fierce battle with another pirate crew that left them devastated. Madaisuki was killed by being stabbed in the skull by a sword after sustaining multiple injuries to the abdomen. His surviving brother, Mawaritosuki, eventually succumbed to poison with the rest of the surviving crew members while singing
Binks' Sake
.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, the skeletal remains of the older of the two brothers had a sword piercing his skull along with the another blade sticking out of his back. Also in the manga, his shirt is torn and his ribcage is exposed.
In the anime, his remains only have swords sticking out of his body, and his clothes remain intact enough to cover his ribcage.
This was all done to censor the gruesome wound, which would be deemed inappropriate for younger audience.
