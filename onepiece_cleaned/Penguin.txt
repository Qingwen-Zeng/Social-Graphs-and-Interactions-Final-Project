in the

Sometime later, they gathered fruits in the forest and encountered a boar that pierced Shachi in the stomach. Penguin tried throwing a bomb that they stole, but it exploded before he could, and the boar severed Penguin's right arm. Law and Bepo saw the explosion and brought them to
Wolf
's farm. Law had Bepo stop their bleeding, but the two had lost so much blood that they needed transfusions. Wolf offered to give his blood to both of them despite the risk. Law then went to work on reattaching Penguin's arm, and after several painstaking hours, he successfully completed the operation and collapsed. Penguin and Shachi recovered, and Wolf was fine. After waking up, Penguin discovered that he could use his severed arm again, and he and Shachi thanked Law.
A week later, Penguin and Shachi recuperated, and they told Wolf and Law their names and history. Law then offered for Penguin and Shachi to become his subordinates and live with him and Wolf, to which Wolf reluctantly consented to, and they accepted.

After a long voyage following one of the
Log Pose
routes of the
Grand Line
, Law and his crew came to the
Sabaody Archipelago
to prepare themselves for the
New World
. Penguin stood behind his captain as Law talked to
X Drake
.
Penguin accompanied his captain to the
Human Auctioning House
in order to observe the auction taking place.
After interruptions by
Monkey D. Luffy
and the
Straw Hat Pirates
, the Heart Pirates found themselves fighting to escape,
alongside
Eustass Kid
's and Luffy's crews, in the face of a daunting
Marine
attack.
Alongside the rest of his crew, Penguin fought against one of the
Pacifistas
;
though the outcome of this battle was not seen, they eventually managed to escape.
Marineford Arc
[
]
During the
Summit War of Marineford
, the Heart Pirates and Penguin were on the Sabaody Archipelago and watching the broadcast of
Portgas D. Ace
's execution. They left after the broadcast cut out.
The crew sailed to
Marineford
and surfaced near the outer wall in order to save the critically injured Luffy.
After
Buggy
dropped Luffy and
Jinbe
to the submarine, the crew moved the injured men inside. While
Koby
's outburst and
Shanks
' arrival distracted
Admiral
Kizaru
, the Polar Tang submerged
and managed to escape the
Aokiji's
and Kizaru's attacks.
Post-War Arc
[
]
On their journey, the Heart Pirates were followed by a Marine battleship that
Boa Hancock
,
Emporio Ivankov
, and his
Newkamas
had taken over. When Hancock questioned Bepo, Penguin and Shachi were shocked how quickly and meekly the bear mink deferred to her. Hancock then invited the Heart Pirates to treat Luffy on
Amazon Lily
.
After the men landed on the island, they were secluded to a camp on the outer shore. Shachi wanted to take a peek of the women, but Penguin warned that they would be killed. The pair then heatedly dismissed Bepo's idea of there being female bears on the island.
After Luffy's treatment was over, Penguin and the crew watched in shock as a
Sea King
was killed by Rayleigh. Penguin was further amazed to learn that Rayleigh's ship had sunk in a storm outside of the
Calm Belt
, forcing Rayleigh to swim the rest of the way. The Heart Pirates then headed off, and Penguin was disappointed about not seeing more of the island.
Later, out in the open sea, Law explained to his crew that they would not be entering the
New World
right away. Penguin voiced his concern about the commotion that
Blackbeard
and
his crew
were causing, but Law wanted to stay away from such fighting. Law then told his crew to follow his orders for the best possible outcome, at which Penguin and his crewmates cheered for their captain.
During the Timeskip
[
]
While Law was staying at
Punk Hazard
, Penguin and the rest of the Heart Pirates crew went to
Zou
.
They were under the care of
Nekomamushi
, since Bepo was a native of Zou.

Wano Country Arc
[
]
After leaving Zou, the Heart Pirates infiltrated Wano Country. On top of a mountain, Bepo, Shachi, and Penguin spotted Luffy and Zoro through binoculars as the latter two entered Okobore Town.
When Luffy and Zoro were heading to Bakura Town in pursuit of a
Gifter
that abducted a little girl, the trio informed Law about the situation.
On the way to Bakura Town, Bepo ate a fish from the polluted river and got sick, causing some delay to Law's group.
After Luffy and Zoro wreaked havoc at Bakura Town, Penguin and Shachi met up with Law and Luffy's group at the ruins of Oden Castle.
Penguin was then seen sitting outside as
Kin'emon
told Luffy's group about Wano's past.
He then witnessed Kaidou's arrival to the Kuri region.
After Luffy rushed off with Law following him and Kin'emon and Kiku left to rescue Tsuru, the rest tried to escape as Kaidou approached the castle and destroyed it with a fire breath.
Penguin and the other males in the group were saved by the kunoichi
Shinobu
's
jutsu
which sunk them into the ground.
Sometime after this ordeal, Penguin worked to deliver Kin'emon's secret message to his allies.
Bepo and the others are released from captivity in exchange for Law.
Penguin, Shachi and Bepo were later captured by the Beasts Pirates and incarcerated in the
Rasetsu District Prison
to be used as bait for Law.
When Law took the bait and appeared, Hawkins then demonstrated his ability on Shachi as Penguin looked on with concern.
The trap, however, did not work as intended, and Law remained resolute in cutting Hawkins down regardless of his or his crewmates' lives, prompting Hawkins to rethink the situation. As a result, Bepo, Shachi, and Penguin were released by Hawkins, who made a deal with Law for their freedom in exchange for his capture. Law ordered his subordinates not to tell Luffy about this in order to not compromise their plan for the eventual raid. The trio later met up with
Nami
at Ebisu Town and gave her Kin'emon's secret message now drawn with two lines on the snake as
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's last message. After Nami left, the Heart Pirates discussed their captain's situation.
Once Law managed to escape from the
Flower Capital
, Penguin and the rest of the crew reunited with their
captain
at some point and entered the battle with the
Beasts Pirates
on the day of the
Fire Festival
. After rescuing Kin'emon's group, the crew was shocked to hear that Kaidou formed an
alliance
with
Big Mom
.
Following the takedown of the guards at the torii gates by the Straw Hat Pirates, the Heart Pirates and the
Scabbards
(except Kin'emon and
Denjiro
) traversed to the back of
Onigashima
in the
Polar Tang
, avoiding the myriad of whirlpools along the way.
When the submarine got close enough, it rose to the surface and Law
teleported
himself, Bepo, Shachi, Penguin, and the Scabbards with them to Onigashima's back entrance.
The Heart Pirates fighting the Beasts Pirates at Onigashima.
Penguin was later seen inside
Kaidou's castle
during the all-out attack on the Beasts Pirates.
Later on, Penguin heard
Sanji
's cry for help as it was broadcasted throughout Onigashima.
Penguin and his two crewmates eventually met up with
Franky
at the Right-Brain Tower, joining forces with him to prevent enemy reinforcements from getting into the
Skull Dome
's Live Floor.
After fires spread throughout the castle, Penguin ran alongside Shachi and the samurai who were carrying Bepo, who had collapsed from the heat.
Raizo
and Jinbe managed to send torrents of water through the castle, extinguishing the fires. Penguin and his crewmates were swept up in the water.
A week after the raid, the Heart Pirates enjoyed the continued festival in the Flower Capital, celebrating the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's victory.
A few days later, at
Tokage Port
, the Heart Pirates prepared their ship to set out from Wano.
After goading from Kid, Law and Luffy also directed their ships down the large waterfall, instead of taking the safer lift at
Mogura Port
.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
On their way to the next island, the Heart Pirates were ambushed by the
Blackbeard Pirates
, who were in search of
Road Poneglyphs
. The attack damaged their submarine and infected the crew with the
Feminization Disease
; Penguin became infected and turned into a woman after clinging onto Shachi. After Law's Haki canceled out the transformation on his own body, the resulting antibodies spread through the crew, curing the infected. The submarine then surfaced at a
Winner Island
, and the crew ran ashore and prepared to fight back against the Blackbeard Pirates. Law saved his crew from a mountain thrown by
Jesus Burgess
and then confronted
Blackbeard
directly.
However, the Heart Pirates were eventually defeated, with only Law and Bepo successfully escaping Winner Island. Penguin's current status is unknown.
