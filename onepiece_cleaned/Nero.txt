Nero the Sea Weasel
was the newest agent of
CP9
.
He was first introduced on the
Puffing Tom
, where he helped to escort
Nico Robin
to
Enies Lobby
.
He was one of the antagonists during the Sea Train voyage in the
Water 7 Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Nero is a pale, slim man, wearing a striking attire consisting of a dark-brown T-shirt, orange pants, decorated shoes and a hat adorned with a red plume. He has two necklaces around his neck, a simple one composed of green beads, and a bigger and more elaborate one, which consists of many red jewels linked together. He wears a glove on his left hand, and bracelets around the wrist.
He has an unique hairstyle, with a bald top crossed by three mohawk-like strips.
Personality
[
]
Having undergone the customary training of CP9 agents, he is a calm and collected individual, seen with the casual way he spoke with Franky when they fought. Nonetheless, he is not above displaying his emotions, such as anger at being tricked, fear in the face of inevitable pain, or exasperation in the face of Franky's antics. Additionally, Nero appears to be less hardened than the other agents, as he easily believed Franky's lie when he asked what was behind him, just so that he could sucker punch him. Beneath his calm exterior, he has a measure of arrogance, thinking that knowing four of the six forms of Rokushiki made him a "superhuman" that could be in the same league as the other, full-fledged CP9 agents. When Rob Lucci expelled Nero from the group with a death threat, Nero became horrified and made a failed attempt to run away.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Nero, while not very strong compared to the other, fully-trained
CP9
agents, was still quite intelligent, since he figured out that the attackers on the Puffing Tom would try going along the roofs of the train cars in order to reach the one containing
Nico Robin
as easily as possible,
and he was able to quickly deduce that
Franky
was vulnerable to attacks aimed at his back.
Rokushiki
[
]
Main article:
Rokushiki
As Nero was still a new recruit, his training incomplete, he only could use four of the six Rokushiki techniques:
Soru, Geppo, Kami-e, and Rankyaku. His lack of Tekkai and Shigan made him unable to block powerful strikes and pierce opponents, respectively. To compensate, he evaded enemy strikes carefully with Soru, Geppo, and Kami-e; for offense, along with slashing with Rankyaku,
he used a pair of
pistols
instead of stabbing with his fingers. He was at least skillful enough to have one variation of Rankyaku.
Regardless of his creative improvising and analytical nature, his lack of mastery of Rokushiki caused
Rob Lucci
to claim Nero was "worthless" to the unit, leading to Nero's dismissal.
Weapons
[
]
Nero's derringers.
To compensate for his lack of Shigan, Nero wielded a pair of derringer flintlocks.

Water 7 Arc

Franky defeats Nero.
Nero was among the
Cipher Pol
agents and
Marines
escorting
Nico Robin
to
Enies Lobby
. As the
Puffing Tom
left
Water 7
, Nero rode in the third car. During the journey, he was awoken from his nap when a report came in that the criminals had escaped and were causing problems on the train.
Nero chose to wait atop his car for the criminals in case they tried to skip over his car. When only
Franky
showed up, Nero was disappointed since Franky was the only one he was not allowed to kill. After Nero introduced himself, Franky tricked him into looking behind him and then sucker punched him.
As the two fought, they were confused by each other's strange abilities.
When Nero
launched himself up into the air
in order to evade Franky's
Master Nails
, Franky pretended to run for the next car. As Nero leaped back to the train, Franky fired at him again; however, Nero had anticipated Franky's trick and maneuvered to behind Franky. Having realized that Franky's back was unprotected, Nero began focusing his attacks at this weak point and evading Franky's counterattacks. Franky placed his back against the roof of the train car and then decided to demonstrate his centaur-like transformation, which Nero found shocking due to its backwards appearance.
However, the transformation did not appear to help Franky in the fight, and Nero managed to knock him off the edge of the car. As Franky clung to the edge, Nero offered to help him back up, but when Nero got closer, Franky flipped himself back up and restrained Nero's arms and legs with his four legs, pinning Nero down on the roof of the car. With Nero unable to move, Franky hit Nero in the face with Ultimate Hammer, breaking the roof and dropping them both into the car.
Lucci attacks Nero.
Franky then kicked Nero into the second car, where the other
CP9
agents were. Nero got back up and stated that he would kill Franky, but
Rob Lucci
would not allow this and cautioned Nero about his emotions since they were supposed to capture Franky alive. Unwilling to tolerate Nero's weakness further, Lucci gave him three seconds to escape. Nero tried to run, but Lucci was faster and stabbed Nero multiple times in the back with
Shigan
. Nero's wounded body was then thrown into the ocean during the
Aqua Laguna
, one of the biggest storms in the world, and Lucci had
Kalifa
write a report expelling Nero from CP9.
