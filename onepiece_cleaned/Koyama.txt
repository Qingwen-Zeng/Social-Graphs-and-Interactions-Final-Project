History

Past
[
]
Forty-one years ago, Koyama was kidnapped by a trio of men. The men planned to take it to the
Flower Capital
to claim a bounty of one
platinum
coin which was set on white boar piglets by the
yakuza
boss
Kurokoma
a year prior. On their way to the Flower Capital, the men stopped at a teahouse and showed off Koyama to a waitress named
Tsurujo
. This conversation was overheard by a thug named
Kin'emon
who ambushed the men after they left the teahouse and stole the piglet from them. After arriving in the Flower Capital, Kin'emon came across a boy named
Denjiro
and showed Koyama to him. Denjiro warned Kin'emon about the parent of the piglet, known as the
Mountain God
, which is said to ruthlessly pursue its child if it is kidnapped. Just then, the two heard sounds of destruction caused by the Mountain God, and were approached by
Kouzuki Oden
, who demanded that they give Koyama to him.
Koyama then began calling for its parent, prompting Kin'emon to tell it to be quiet. Oden insisted on taking the piglet, but Kin'emon protested as he still wanted to claim its bounty. One of Koyama's original kidnappers then found the group and warned Kin'emon that the piglet's parent ate his friends and Tsuru, which angered Kin'emon, causing him to drop Koyama and run off to fight the Mountain God. After Kin'emon was defeated, Oden held the piglet up in the air to attract the Mountain God's attention and used the opportunity to slice it in half, defeating it.
At some point after the
Mountain God Incident
, Koyama and its parent befriended Oden and his
retainers
and were given names by them. Eleven years after the Mountain God Incident, Oden and his retainers went to the Flower Capital to hold a procession. A palanquin was strapped to Koyama's back and it carried Oden through the capital.
