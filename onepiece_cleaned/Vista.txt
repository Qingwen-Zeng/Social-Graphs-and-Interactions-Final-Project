He also had black pants, and black shoes. He was seen holding a wooden training sword, practicing his swordsmanship skills.
Personality
[

Whitebeard
. He also seems to be modest. He expressed a desire to fight
Dracule Mihawk
and was happy that he got to cross blades with him. He also expressed a great hatred for
Blackbeard
as when he mocked Whitebeard's inability to save his crewmate, Vista had to be held back from attacking him.
He expressed great sorrow at Ace's demise, furiously muttering to Marco, his comrade and brother that "we let our guard down".

Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the commander of the 5th division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Vista has authority over the lower-ranking members of the crew. He has also been stated to be the strongest swordsman of the Whitebeard Pirates, as the very division he led specialized in swordsmanship, acting as one of the most combative divisions for the crew.
He is a very experienced veteran, as he was shown as a member of the Whitebeard Pirates from the times of
Gol D. Roger
. He is one of the strongest members of the Whitebeard Pirates, as shown by his position as commander. He was the one individual
Marco
specifically commanded and entrusted
Luffy
's protection to. Even
Dracule Mihawk
acknowledges his reputation.
Another indication of Vista's strength is that during the
Summit War of Marineford
, despite having fought against individual
Warlords of the Sea
and
admirals
as well as numerous Marine officers, he sustained no significant injuries.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Vista possesses immense physical strength, as he is able to match against
Dracule Mihawk
who is known as the strongest swordsman in the world. He was capable of deflecting an attack from an axe-wielding giant, as well as easily slice down cannonballs in midair.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Vista dueling the World's Greatest Swordsman.
Vista has extraordinary mastery in dual wielding swordsmanship and even Mihawk acknowledges his skills. He even managed to deflect Mihawk's flying slash attack which is powerful enough to cut through battleships. In the anime, he was also able to block bullets with his swords to protect his allies from being shot while escaping.

Weapons
[
]
Vista wields a pair of
sabers
with purple hilts that are visibly distinguishable from another by their different sheaths attached to his waist. They are especially durable, withstanding a clash with Mihawk's
Yoru
.
In the anime, some of his attacks generate red flower petals (in a similar way pink flower petals materialize whenever
Nico Robin
uses
her abilities
), which befits his epithet "
Flower Sword"
; also in the anime, Vista has so far only produced rose petals, but mentioned that he could produce other types of flower petals as well. Whether this means he is a
Devil Fruit
user has yet to be determined.

Rose Rondo
(
薔薇輪舞
,
Rōzu Rondo
?
, literally meaning "Rose Round Dance")
: Vista jumps backwards and swings his swords, launching several red rose petals that fly towards the opponent. The effect of the rose petals remains unknown as the attack was blocked. It was first seen used against Mihawk in a filler scene of the anime
and was once again used to stop Akainu's magma.
In
One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2
, Vista rapidly slashes foes while giving off rose petals ending with a hurricane slash.

Adventures With Kouzuki Oden
[
]
Vista 30 years ago
Thirty years ago, Vista was among the
Whitebeard Pirates
when they arrived for the first time at
Wano Country
. The crew was shipwrecked and before going to civilization to get supplies, they encountered
Kouzuki Oden
, who asked
Whitebeard
to let him join their crew after a brief clash.
The Whitebeard Pirates later had a feast with Oden and his retainers. Oden kept asking to join the crew, but he was turned down. Two weeks later, the Whitebeard Pirates tried to leave Wano without Oden. As they were leaving, the crew was surprised when Oden wrapped a chain around the
Moby Dick
's mast and got dragged with the ship. As Oden held onto the chain,
Izou
was also holding on to Oden and got dragged with him. After Izou was pulled up onboard, Oden accepted Whitebeard's challenge of holding onto the chain for three days before he could be accepted into the crew. For the next three days, the crew watched how Oden withstood his ordeal. When Oden had an hour left to complete the challenge, the crew started cheering for him. After Oden was accepted into the crew, the Whitebeard Pirates had adventures with him as well as
Toki
, whom Oden helped, and
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
, who had stowed away on the Moby Dick.
Four years after Oden joined, the Whitebeard Pirates arrived at an island and noticed a commotion that frightened even the animals. The crew then clashed with the
Roger Pirates
for three days and three nights before the skirmish ultimately became a gift exchange. Afterwards, the Whitebeard Pirates parted ways with Oden and his family.
Shiki's Visit
[
]
Twenty two years ago, Vista was aboard the Moby Dick when
Shiki
spoke about his plans.
Arrival of Ace
[

After
Portgas D. Ace
was inducted into the crew, Vista was amused by Ace's audacity in his many futile attempts to assassinate Whitebeard.

Marineford Arc
[

Vista and New World pirates vs. Vice Admiral Lonz.
Vista fought alongside the other Whitebeard Pirates after
Aokiji
froze the bay and immobilized all the ships. Later, he deflected
Vice Admiral
Lonz
's axe attack with his swords.
When
Marco
commanded him to back up Luffy from Mihawk's assault, Vista successfully blocked Mihawk's sword with his two sabers before engaging in battle with the
Warlord
.
As the
Pacifista
units moved in, Vista and Mihawk decided to postpone their battle to escape from being surrounded.
He, along with his fellow crewmates, was shocked when
Squard
stabbed Whitebeard.
He successfully made it onto Whitebeard's hidden black paddle-ship and was seen standing next to his crewmates. When Vista's fellow commanders Marco and
Jozu
were both defeated by the admirals, he showed panic. When Whitebeard ordered for everyone to back up Luffy to save Ace, Vista sliced down some cannonballs aimed at the Straw Hat captain, and urged him to press on. After Ace was freed and began fighting alongside Luffy, Vista commented on the remarkable teamwork the two of them had. Vista, Marco, and
Atmos
were then shocked to see
Akainu
pierce Ace through the chest with his magma fist. After that, he and Marco simultaneously attacked Akainu to keep him away from Luffy, with Vista commenting that he regretted letting his guard down.
Separated from Whitebeard, who was confronting
Blackbeard
, Vista was getting irritated at Blackbeard for speaking ill of Whitebeard and of Ace's and
Thatch
's deaths, and had to be held back by his fellow crewmates. After Whitebeard's death, Vista and the other Whitebeard Pirates prepared to face off against Akainu to defend Luffy and to carry him on to the next era. He then appeared next to Marco, who was speaking to
Shanks
. Upon the war coming to a close, he and the remnants of Whitebeard's crew left.
Post-War Arc
[
]
He, along with the rest of the crew, attended the funeral of Whitebeard and Ace at an undisclosed location somewhere in the
New World

During the Timeskip
