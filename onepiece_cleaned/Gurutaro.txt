Past
[
]
Forty-one years ago, Gurutaro was selected to inform
Kouzuki Oden
about his disownment.
While walking through the
Flower Capital
to find him, Gurutaro noticed a commotion in a crematory, and went to investigate. The mourners there asked Gurutaro to stop a man who was boiling a pot of oden over the deceased's remains, which Gurutaro realized was Oden himself. After Oden gave a farewell speech to
Katsuzo
, the deceased, Gurutaro ran after him, apologizing on his behalf for his odd behavior.
Following Oden into the streets, Gurutaro informed Oden that he was to be apprehended, but offered to accept a bribe instead. However, they were interrupted by the
Mountain God Incident
, which Oden left to help contain.
Gurutaro's status in the current day is unknown.
