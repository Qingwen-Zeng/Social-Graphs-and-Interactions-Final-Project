History
[

Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
When found in the desert by the
Straw Hats
after they saved him from a
Sandora Lizard
, he would only let
Nami
and
Vivi
ride. Out of admiration, Nami named him "Matsuge" but he refused to let anyone else on, prompting the rest of the crew to beat him up and label him as a "Pervy Camel"
(
エロラクダ
,
Ero Rakuda
?
)
, because he only let the two women ride). The crew only knew of that because of
Chopper
's translation.
During the crew's escape from
Rainbase
, he introduced them to his friend,
Hasami
, who would help them escape across the desert. It was revealed by Chopper that Matsuge was born in Rainbase and so had a lot of friends in the area.
He disguised himself as Vivi by riding a
Super Spot-Billed Duck
and wearing a white cape. He was paired up with Usopp and got chased by
Mr. 2
.
He was as weak as Usopp since Mr. 2 only needed one second for each of them.
After
Crocodile
's defeat, Matsuge was ordered to be given special treatment, as well as being allowed to join the
Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops
(even though he is a camel).

, owned and operated by

(

Manga and Anime Differences
[
]
In the manga, the Straw Hats first met Matsuge when they saved him from a
Sandora Lizard
. While he already had a saddle on his back, it is unknown who the original owner is or where he came from.
In the anime, he was originally from
Rainbase
and was bringing weapons back and forth to the rebels from
Nanohana
to
Katorea
. During one of these trips he and Chopper became acquainted, since Chopper was brought to Katorea by accident and Matsuge smuggled him back to Nanohana. Luffy later saved him from a desert plant while he and his crew were on their way to the
Yuba
oasis, and with the help of the other Straw Hats, rescued Matsuge from the Sandora Lizard as they did in the manga. When Matsuge revealed he knew all along that the rebels were in Katorea,
Luffy
,
Sanji
and Usopp pummeled him for not telling them.
