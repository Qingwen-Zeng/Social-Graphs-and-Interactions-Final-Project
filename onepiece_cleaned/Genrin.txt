Personality
[

Genrin is a selfless man who is already prepared for death due to his illness.
Like other
Ebisu Town
citizens, he adored
Yasuie
and rushed to prevent his execution despite his poor health.
He had his emotional expressions stripped away by eating a defective leftover
SMILE
fruit, causing him to only be able to smile and laugh.
History
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Genrin was visited by
Yasuie
who brought him a piece of millet and water. Genrin tried to reject the offering and convince Yasuie to eat the food himself, but instead Yasuie gave him extra pieces of millet.
When Yasuie was sentenced to execution, Genrin and other Ebisu Town citizens rushed to the Flower Capital to save him. However, they arrived too late and had to witness Yasuie being shot to death. Due to their
SMILE
side effects, they were unable to mourn his death openly and instead burst into laughter.
