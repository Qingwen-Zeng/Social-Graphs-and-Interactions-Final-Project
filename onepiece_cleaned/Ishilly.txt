Personality
[
]
Ishilly is friendly and playful. She welcomes
Luffy
's group with a warm smile and happily swims with
Sanji
; enjoying his company. She seems to have taken a liking to the Straw Hat chef as she shows her concern for him after he suffered critical blood loss from a massive nosebleed.
She is also curious since she volunteered to open the barrel that
Caribou
was in. That was a careless mistake as she did not consider that the barrel was meant to keep something in and this led to her and her friends' kidnapping.

Apart from the ability to breathe underwater, as a mermaid she also has the ability to swim very quickly at speeds much faster than the flying fish used by the
Flying Fish Riders
. However, like any mermaid, she is vulnerable on land.
She also appears to be a skilled dancer, as she is dancing during the banquet for the Straw Hat Pirates,
and is considered one of the top five stars of the Mermaid Café.

Ishilly panicking over a dying Sanji.
Ishilly was first seen in the Mermaid Cove welcoming four of
Camie
's friends: Luffy,
Sanji
,
Chopper
, and
Usopp
.
After Sanji was invited for a swim, Ishilly was seen enjoying his company and said that Sanji was fun.
When the three princes of the appeared searching for the Straw Hats, Ishilly hid Sanji by holding him close to her, unconsciously pressing his head against her chest (much to Sanji's delight). The mermaids denied seeing any intruders and just as the princes were leaving, Sanji, having gotten over stimulated with his face half buried in Ishilly's bosom, suffered a massive nosebleed, causing her to panic.
After Luffy, Usopp, Chopper, and Camie took Sanji to the town port for emergency treatment, the mermaids apologized to the princes for concealing the pirates while Ishilly showed concern for Sanji.

Once the princes left, Ishilly,
Fillonce
, and another mermaid discovered a tightly-sealed barrel in the Mermaid Cove. The mermaids decided to open the barrel, curious to see what was inside.
After Ishilly loosened some of the bolts, Caribou popped out and terrified the unwitting mermaids.
Caribou
proceeded to capture them with the power of the
Numa Numa no Mi
as they tried to flee and scream for help. Therefore, Ishilly and her two friends became the first victims in Caribou's mermaid kidnapping scheme. The other mermaids at the cove had no clue that the barrel they found had something to do with Ishilly's disappearance and the citizens of Fish-Man Island blamed the Straw Hats for the kidnappings.
