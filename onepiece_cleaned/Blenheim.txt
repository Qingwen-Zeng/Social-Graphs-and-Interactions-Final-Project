Blenheim
is the former 9th division
commander
of the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Blenheim is a huge, muscular man who is not much smaller than
Whitebeard
. He is large enough to carry a normal-sized human on his shoulder. He has a large mouth, small eyes, a downward pointed nose, high cheekbones, and thin, arched eyebrows. He also has dark hair pulled back in a braided ponytail, a gray beard, and chest hair. He wears a gray vest, and has purple tattoos of Whitebeard's
Jolly Roger
on both of his deltoids, right over two pairs of yellow armbands he wears. He has loose grayish pants tucked inside standard boots.
Twenty-years before the start of the series, Blenheim wore the same kind of outfit but had a black beard.
Thirty-years before the start of the series, Blenheim wore a dark-colored shirt underneath his vest and he had no beard and shorter braided ponytail. In the anime, his outfit is replaced with a dotted green shirt.
Personality
[
]
Blenheim is quite loyal to the Whitebeard Pirates and Whitebeard, as he was willing to risk his own life in order to save
Ace
from execution during the war at
Marineford
. Compared to some of his more expressive comrades, Blenheim is rather stoic, and he often responds to crises more with anger and frustration than alarm or grief. This was the case when
Squard
stabbed Whitebeard.
Though he often maintains composure when things go awry, he shows more emotion when things good happen, as seen when he cheered and pumped his arms when Ace was freed.
Additionally, he was saddened and upset at his captain's decision to make Marineford his final battle, showing that he more so represses his emotions rather than being less feeling by nature.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the commander of the 9th division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Blenheim has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. Physically, Blenheim is quite strong, as he was able to carry a frozen and unconscious
Jozu
back to the escape ship.
Weapons
[
]
Near the start of the battle, Blenheim was seen carrying a huge sword, but his proficiency is unknown.
Twenty-years before the series started, during the meeting of Whitebeard and
Golden Lion Shiki
, he already had this sword.

. Afterwards, the Whitebeard Pirates parted ways with Oden and his family.
When

When Luffy and
Galdino
freed Ace, Blenheim stood next to
Kingdew
and
Jinbe
, cheering for their friend's liberation.
Whitebeard decided to that Marineford would be his final battle, and Blenheim and his crewmates listened in shock and grief to their captain's declaration.
Blenheim and the others refused to let Whitebeard sacrifice himself, but he demanded that they follow orders and let him. Blenheim was then asked by some other Whitebeard Pirates members to help lift an unconscious and frozen
Jozu
.
While carrying Jozu to safety, Blenheim witnessed
Admiral
Akainu
impale Ace.
