Big Mom Pirates
and as
Totto Land
's
Minister of Juice
(
ジュース大臣

Jūsu Daijin

)
,
governing over
100% Island
.
Due to her actions and role, she is a major antagonist in the
Whole Cake Island Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Smoothie is a statuesque tan-skinned woman from the
Longleg Tribe
with wavy white hair that stretches down her back with bangs covering her right eye, blue eyes, prominent lips with silver lipstick (lavender lipstick in the anime), she additionally has disproportionately large hands, even for her size as she was able to wrap one hand around
Nami
's waist
and she is exceptionally tall like all longlegs, standing 464 cm (15'3").
Smoothie wears a pink striped leotard, a large yellow scarf that flows nearly to the ground, sleeves around her elbows, a huge floppy cap resembling an oversized beret (although she was not seen wearing it during the
Tea Party
) and a pair of long dark boots that reach up to her knees with decorative adornments at the top. She also has a tattoo of a rose on her upper right leg.
Personality
[
]
Smoothie approaches things with a carefree attitude. She will agree to help crewmates if she has the time but tends not to display any investment into the tasks she does take on; however she will be remorseful for failing said tasks.
Though she may be nonchalant most of the time, Smoothie can get very serious should circumstances require it and will waste no time in creating tactics to smooth out a given problem in the most efficient way possible. She is also perceptive on other people's nature and will make decisions based on how someone might react, as shown when she neglected to tell Big Mom about the prisoner revolt in Whole Cake Chateau due to knowing that her mother would fly into a rage nobody would want to deal with.
She also quickly realized that
Katakuri
was disturbed and asked him if something was wrong after he foresaw
Pudding
crying.
Smoothie has a very cruel side too her as well, as she likes to squeeze the life out of subordinates, even when being pleaded with to stop, and enjoys drinking the liquid produced while callously dropping dried-out bodies aside, treating them as sources of liquid rather than people.
This is further shown when she hung a woman from a rope, along with a giraffe and a volcanic rock, using them as drink dispensers. She can get carried away while she is in her cruel side like when she grabbed Nami with one hand and later wrapped both hands around her waist and chest area and began squeezing Nami without her devil fruit powers,she used her strength to hurt Nami and make her suffer instead of killing her. During special occasions, such as Big Mom's
Tea Party
, Smoothie can be friendly and polite, greeting the guests and warmly offering them drinks.
In spite of her cruelty and carefreeness, Smoothie is very loyal to her family and crew, as she will execute any assignment given to her by those she respects. When it comes to situations that will surely make her mother angry, Smoothie will take it upon herself to save her from unnecessary trouble, as she did not report the breakout at the Prisoner Library. She also cares deeply for her family and crew, as she was shocked when
Capone Bege
was about to assassinate her mother, and warned her siblings and crewmates on Big Mom going on another rampage in Sweet City. Like
Oven
,
Galette
, and
Brûlée
, Smoothie detests traitors, as she got furious at Bege and his crew in their attempt to assassinate their mother and at
Jinbe
for joining and aiding the
Straw Hats
.
Smoothie appears to be confident in her abilities. Similar to Katakuri, she does not appear to brag about her power and deals with problems efficiently. When
Perospero
contacted her to bring down the
Thousand Sunny
, Smoothie commented that he should have let her handle the situation from the start.
Smoothie can be a bit reckless, seen when she made herself bigger in an attempt to sink the Thousand Sunny at the risk of sinking her own ship.
She also has the utmost pride in her crew, as Smoothie was in disbelief that she and her crew were taken lightly after Bege's assassination plot against Big Mom failed, and when Bege's fortress was under attack by Big Mom, she expressed her intention to torture the
Fire Tank
and Straw Hat Pirates to set up an example for others if they underestimate them.
Smoothie usually keeps her composure during battle and other frantic situations, as she only commented that
Reiju
was "trouble" after being poisoned by her.
The only time Smoothie tends to lose her composure completely is when her mother goes on a rampage due to her cravings. During such instances, Smoothie has been seen in panic and screaming to her siblings to run while fleeing from her rampaging mother.
Although she is a hybrid, Smoothie shares her paternal heritage by exposing and decorating her
long legs
.
Relationship
[
]
Family
[
]
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
As her 14th daughter, Smoothie is very loyal to
her mother
. She seems to wish to save her mother unnecessary trouble, as she reassured her mother that she did not need to come.
She is willing to accompany her mother to
Wano Country
for revenge against the Straw Hats. Despite her respect for her mother, Smoothie is deeply terrified of her and wasted no time fleeing from her and warning her siblings to run when she goes on a food craving rampage.
She appears to have great faith in her mother as Smoothie believes Big Mom will return to the crew after she was stranded on Wano Country,
Kaidou
's territory.
Charlotte Citron and Cinnamon
[
]
Smoothie seems to get along with her younger sisters,
Citron
and
Cinnamon
. They both serve under Smoothie in her squad of the
Big Mom Pirates
.
Charlotte Katakuri
[
]
While they are not seen interacting much, Smoothie seems to respect and get along well with her older half-brother and fellow Sweet Commander
Katakuri
. When Katakuri was troubled upon foreseeing
Pudding
falling to the ground and crying, Smoothie realized his uneasiness and asked him if something was wrong, implying that she knows him well enough to distinguish his true feelings despite his usually stoic attitude.
Charlotte Perospero
[
]
Smoothie seems to get along with and to greatly respect her eldest half-brother
Perospero
. Despite being a Sweet Commander and higher in the crew hierarchy than him, Smoothie is perfectly willing to follow Perospero's plans and orders. However, she can still get annoyed with him such as when he fantasized about becoming the new captain of the Big Mom Pirates after Big Mom was stranded in Kaidou's territory, causing her to scold him and Daifuku and telling them that Big Mom would survive and return to them.
Crew
[
]
Big Mom Pirates
[
]
As one of the
Sweet Commanders
, she is highly respected among the crew and has authority over the lesser members.
In the anime, she will not hesitate to sacrifice them by using her powers as long as she can get the job done efficiently.
Tamago
[
]
Smoothie seems to hold
Baron Tamago
in high regards as she seeks and listens to his advice in spite of holding higher authority within the crew.
Later when she failed to capture
Brook
, she reported to Tamago right away and apologized for failing.
Enemies
[
]
Fire Tank Pirates
[
]
They once served under Big Mom's crew and were seemingly loyal. However, when
Bege
revealed his treachery, he attempted to kill Big Mom as an incapacitated Smoothie was helpless to watch and wanted to stop them.
When his assassination plot failed, she and her crew were able to regain their composure and move in on him and his allies in response to his treachery.
After Bege transformed into his
Big Father form
and his allies retreated into his fortress, Smoothie announced her intention to torture them for underestimating her crew.
When her crew managed to route their enemies, they prepared to execute them until the Whole Cake Chateau collapsed, allowing her enemies to escape as Bege mocked them in the process.
Once the crew recovered, Smoothie swore to her mother that she would not allow their enemies to escape alive.
Sanji Retrieval Team
[
]
Because of their enmity with Big Mom, Smoothie and the rest of her family view the crew as their enemies. She indirectly encountered them when she had trouble with Brook after he slipped past her and locked her out of the Treasure Room with the
Poneglyphs
, though Big Mom dealt with him herself.
When she saw
Luffy
at the wedding, she was surprised at Luffy being alive due to the report of his death.
After Luffy caused Big Mom to scream, Smoothie was incapacitated as the Straw Hats' allies tried to kill her mother only to fail. After forcing the pirates to retreat, Smoothie seized
Nami
, but Reiju freed her.
Once the crew retreated into Bege's fortress, Smoothie was looking forward to torturing them for humiliating her family.
She and her family later subdued Luffy,
Sanji
, and the Vinsmokes but were unable to execute them due to the collapse of the Whole Cake Chateau, which allowed the crew to escape.
Once the crew recovered, Smoothie swore to her mother that she would not allow their enemies to escape alive.
As the crew were escaping, Smoothie and her squad pursued the Straw Hats.
Smoothie personally tried to attack the
Sunny
with a flying slash but missed and cursed
Jinbe
for aiding her enemies.
Her hatred for the Straw Hat Pirates is great enough that she traveled to Wano alongside her mother and other siblings in order to take revenge on them.
Vinsmoke Family
[
]
Since Smoothie participated in her mother's plot to assassinate the
Vinsmoke Family
, Smoothie is an enemy of that family.
Reiju
kicked Smoothie on her arm, causing her to drop Nami,
and Smoothie remarks Reiju's poison abilities to be "some trouble".
Later as the Vinsmoke Family fought against the Big Mom Pirates, Smoothie managed to overpower Reiju but failed to kill her after the Tamatebako exploded and caused the Whole Cake Chateau to collapse.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of the Three Sweet Commanders of the
Big Mom Pirates
, Smoothie's authority within the crew is second only to
her mother
. As the Minister of Juice, Smoothie has authority over
100% Island
in
Totto Land
.
Vito
noted Smoothie as a "monster" among the Big Mom Pirates, comparing her to
Katakuri
.
Her bounty of
932,000,000 suggests that the
World Government
considers her extremely dangerous.
Given her title of Sweet Commander, it is likely that she is stronger than her very powerful brothers,
Compote
,
Daifuku,
Oven
and
Perospero
. Together with Daifuku and
Galette
, she managed to subdue Sanji, Reiju and Luffy, although the latter was heavily weakened.
Smoothie has a considerable amount of leadership and tactical skill, and can quickly come up with plans for her forces to trap and kill enemies.
She is shown to have a strong will, as she was able to withstand Big Mom's burst of
Supreme King Haki
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Smoothie possesses an extremely high level of physical strength befitting her size, being able to pick up, with one hand, and with both hands squeeze out a normal-sized person using her ability with little effort.
She also managed to squeeze a giraffe in a similar fashion with one grip.
The anime shows her possessing enough strength to send Vinsmoke Reiju flying back, and having a strong enough grip to stop Nami from wriggling or moving in her hand.
She has considerable durability, as she was able to resist a powerful kick from
Vinsmoke Reiju
without being forced back.
In the anime, she was also able to easily block several attacks from Chopper's Kung-Fu Point.
Being a hybrid of the
Longleg Tribe
, it can be assumed she has powerful legs.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Shibo Shibo no Mi
Smoothie wrings juice out of a woman.
Smoothie ate the Shibo Shibo no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to drain liquid from both living and non-living things. She uses her power by twisting her target and wringing it out like a soaked cloth, though she can also drain liquid from a target by cutting it with her sword.
She can squeeze the liquid out of anything, including animals, people, and even substances that would normally be too dangerous to touch, such as lava. Notably, the extracted liquid can be consumed like juice and seems to have an exquisite taste.
She can wring the juice out of a person, leaving them severely dehydrated. Aside from the loss of liquid, their body being twisted during the wringing process does not cause the victim any damage. She can also use her power to wring harmful substances, such as poison, out of a person's body, including her own.
Smoothie is also able to absorb the extracted liquid into herself, allowing her to make herself and her weapons much bigger and stronger. Once her body is filled with liquid, she can release the absorbed liquid in powerful concentrated blasts, as seen when she used her sword to send a large flying blast of liquid towards the
Thousand Sunny
.
Weapons
[
]
Smoothie's sword.
Smoothie carries a large sword on her back, with its sheath shaped like a drill bit.
She can combine it with her Devil Fruit ability to drain liquid from any opponents she cuts with it
and absorb liquid into it to increase its size and then unleash it as massive flying blasts.
She has shown to possess considerable swordsmanship skills, using it to deflect cannon fire.
The anime shows her possessing enough skill to clash with Vinsmoke Ichiji and Reiju.

Charlotte Linlin
and her unknown fifteenth
Longleg
husband, as the first of a set of sororal triplets, preceding
Citron
and
Cinnamon
. Smoothie is overall the fourteenth daughter of the
Charlotte Family
.
At an unknown point in the past, Smoothie earned enough acclaim as a fighter and leader to earn a position among the
Sweet Commanders
.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
The day before the wedding between
Charlotte Pudding
and
Sanji
, Smoothie and her brother
Katakuri
arrived at the
Whole Cake Chateau
.
Smoothie guards the Room of Treasure with Tamago.
Inside the Room of Treasure, Smoothie and
Tamago
were guarding the three
poneglyphs
in
Big Mom
's possession. Smoothie used her
Devil Fruit power
to squeeze the life out of a woman, while Tamago explained what poneglyphs are and that they needed to increase their security of the poneglyphs in Big Mom's possession, because he suspected that
Pedro
would come for them just like he did five years prior.
When Pedro indeed showed up, Tamago and some of the soldiers went after him. While this happened,
Brook
managed to take Smoothie's forces by surprise, enter the Room of Treasure, and lock them out. However, since the Room of Treasure only had one entrance, Smoothie planned on killing Brook once he got outside, but Tamago told her to capture Brook alive so Big Mom could add him to her collection.
While Smoothie was waiting outside for Brook, Big Mom showed up, enraged that someone tried to ruin her special day. As Smoothie tried to explain to Big Mom that she did not need to come, Big Mom busted through the door to confront Brook.
Smoothie orders her troops to deal with Luffy's prisoner revolt.
While Big Mom battled Brook, Smoothie was informed of
Jinbe
's rebellion and showed concern of how it would affect her mother's plans. She then instructed her subordinates to seal off all corridors leading to the fourth floor and gave them permission to kill the prisoners.
Later on, she watched while her mother toyed with a badly beaten Brook and her subordinates searched his clothes.
On the day of the wedding, Smoothie was at the wedding venue, serving drinks to the guests.
When the wedding ceremony started, she saw Katakuri being confused and asked him about the situation.
Upon seeing
duplicates
of
Monkey D. Luffy
emerging from the wedding cake and causing chaos at the venue, Smoothie noted that Luffy and his companions did not die at the Prisoner Library as
Charlotte Opera
claimed.
When Luffy caused Big Mom to start screaming, Smoothie was immobilized due to having to shield her ears. She noticed that
Capone Bege
,
Vito
, and
Gotti
were aiming
their weapons
at Big Mom and yelled for someone to stop them.
Smoothie was worried when the
Fire Tank Pirates
launched their weapons at Big Mom. However, Big Mom's scream destroyed the weapons before they could hit her. Smoothie was then given
earplugs
by Katakuri and the
Big Mom Pirates
proceeded to surround Luffy and Bege's groups.
As Bege
transformed into a fortress
and his allies retreated into it, Smoothie managed to catch up to
Nami
and grabbed her with one hand. She began squeezing Nami with both hands, but was quickly repelled by
Vinsmoke Reiju
, with the latter kicking her arm and injecting it with some kind of poison. After all of Bege's allies and the
Vinsmoke Family
safely entered the fortress, Smoothie squeezed Reiju's poison out of her arm, commenting that her ability was trouble.
Smoothie and her siblings subdue Reiju and the Straw Hats.
As Big Mom assaulted the fortress, the Big Mom Pirates stood by and prepared to attack anyone who left the fortress.
After Bege returned to human form,
Caesar Clown
attempted to flee the venue with him in tow while Luffy, Sanji, and the Vinsmoke Family face off against the Big Mom Pirates. In the ensuing conflict, Smoothie,
Daifuku
, and
Galette
subdued Luffy, Sanji, and Reiju as they were falling back. However, at that moment, the
Tamatebako
dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and exploded, causing the castle to collapse.
The Big Mom Pirates were saved when
Streusen
used
his Devil Fruit power
to turn the whole castle into a cake. However, the
Straw Hat Pirates
, Bege's crew, and the Vinsmokes escaped during the chateau's destruction. Smoothie assured her mother that they would not allow their enemies to escape Whole Cake Island, but then she noticed that Big Mom was showing signs of her craving illness.
Smoothie quickly ran from her and alerted her siblings and crew of Big Mom's craving illness for wedding cake. She then asked for Streusen, but was alarmed to hear that the head chef was severely injured from the fall. After
Perospero
diverted Big Mom's attention to the Straw Hats, the Big Mom Pirates were at a loss of what to do since they could not make another cake within a short amount of time. However, Pudding arrived and explained her plan to satiate Big Mom's craving.
Later, Smoothie, Daifuku,
Compote
, and other forces of the Big Mom Pirates assembled a fleet to hunt down the Straw Hats, the Fire Tank Pirates, and the
Sun Pirates
before any of them could escape
Totto Land
.
Smoothie and her squad later joined the fleet of
Tartes
that were pursuing the
Thousand Sunny
.
Smoothie attacking the Thousand Sunny.
When the Fire Tank Pirates arrived with the substitute wedding cake, Perospero assigned Smoothie and her squad to continue pursuing the Straw Hats.
Smoothie then increased her size and tried to attack the Sunny with a flying slash but missed. As
Citron
and
Cinnamon
warned her that her own ship would sink if she grew any bigger, Smoothie cursed Jinbe for being able to commandeer the Sunny to dodge her attacks.
As the Sunny approached
Cacao Island
, Smoothie went back to her normal size and ordered her crewmates to reinforce the fleet.
Smoothie was surprised when
Germa 66
appeared and attacked the Big Mom Pirates' forces on the island, but she told her crew to remain focused on pursuing the Straw Hats.
After Luffy and Sanji made it back to the Thousand Sunny, Smoothie was about to bombard the Straw Hats. However,
Vinsmoke Judge
interfered, angering Smoothie.
After the Sun Pirates arrived, they stopped Smoothie's ship from moving.
After the
Queen Mama Chanter
attacked the Sunny, Smoothie expressed confusion when she saw that it was the Sun Pirates' ship that was destroyed. She noticed that
Wadatsumi
had carried the Sunny away and quickly informed her comrades. As the Sun Pirates held back the Big Mom Pirates, Smoothie drew her sword.
The Big Mom Pirates were later joined by Linlin when she arrived at the island.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
When Big Mom tried to infiltrate
Wano Country
, Smoothie accompanied her mother and crew as they attempted to climb the waterfall into the country on the Queen Mama Chanter. When
Kaidou's forces
began firing on them, Smoothie helped deflect the cannon fire. Later, as the carp began swimming up the waterfall with the ship in tow, Smoothie watched in disbelief at how the carp were able to swim upwards. However, just as they reached the top of the waterfall,
King
attacked the ship, causing it to fall off the waterfall and Big Mom to fall into the sea.
On the seas near Wano, Smoothie reflected on the situation with the rest of her family, stating they were lucky the ship had not capsized. When Perospero and Daifuku started arguing over who should take control of the Big Mom Pirates in the event Big Mom died, she angrily berated them, telling them not to assume their mother would die so easily.
The crew later heard about Big Mom's newly formed alliance with
Kaidou
. On the day of the
Fire Festival
, the Big Mom Pirates attempted to climb the waterfall again, but their ship was knocked down by
Marco
.
Final Saga

Egghead Arc
[
]
Over a week after the Big Mom Pirates attempted raid on Wano, Smoothie was with
Mont-d'Or
where they both watched
Vegapunk
's pre recorded
World-Wide broadcast
, Smoothie was surprised Vegapunk knew about the earthquake that occurred today even though the message was recorded days before he died.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
While escaping from her rampaging mother in the anime, Smoothie saw Opera running with the crowd when Big Mom's cravings acted up. Smoothie caught her brother and blamed him for the situation, due to him not warning the crew of Luffy's escape. Opera was then motivated to confront Big Mom and ended up having his lifespan drained. In the manga, it was not shown what led to Big Mom attacking Opera.
