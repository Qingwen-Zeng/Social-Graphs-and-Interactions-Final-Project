Kurotsuru dislikes Ace because the young pirate kicked him in the face. He was angry enough at the pirate to throw him into a river.
History
[
]
Ace
mistook Dr. Kurotsuru for the real
Blackbeard
and kicked him to the ground, much to the fury of everyone else around them.
When Ace realized his mistake, the angry doctor, an angry cook (whom Ace did not pay for his meal from earlier), and other townspeople kicked Ace into the river.
Two years later, the
Lulusia Kingdom
was annihilated by the
World Government
. It is unknown if Kurotsuru was on the island during this time.
