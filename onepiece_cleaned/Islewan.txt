early in his pirate career. Four years after Oden joined, the Whitebeard Pirates arrived at an island and noticed a commotion that frightened even the animals. The crew then clashed with the Roger Pirates for three days and three nights before the skirmish ultimately became a gift exchange. Afterwards, the Whitebeard Pirates parted ways with Oden and his family.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga version of Whitebeard and Ace's funeral in
Chapter 590
, Islewan cannot be seen among those in attendance. However, the anime version of the exact same scene in
Episode 505
explicitly shows Islewan alongside the other attendees.
Although it can be assumed that Islewan was at the funeral, there is no visual evidence of his attendance in the manga to support this assumption and, as such, his attendance can only be considered non-canon.
In the manga version of the battle between the Roger and Whitebeard Pirates in
Chapter 966
, Islewan can be seen charging alongside the Whitebeard Pirates into battle. However, the anime version of the same scene in
Episode 966
does not show Islewan in the battle.
