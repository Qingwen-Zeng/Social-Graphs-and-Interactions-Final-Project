Rocks D. Xebec
, commonly known simply as
Rocks
, was the
captain
of the
Rocks Pirates
. He was a prominent figure four decades ago, before the Pirate King
Gol D. Roger
came into power.
He was ultimately defeated by an alliance formed by
Monkey D. Garp
and Roger, earning Garp the nickname "Hero of the Marines".
Appearance
Four decades ago, Rocks appeared as a tall man, but more normally proportioned in comparison to some of his huge (albeit not
giant-sized
) crewmates. His long, darkish hair was an unruly mass, with locks sticking out unevenly behind his head, in every direction. He had slanted eyes and seemingly tended to sport a wide, toothy smile. Rocks' main outfit appeared to have consisted of a high-collared sailor's coat with fringed epaulettes, plus a buttoned shoulder belt.
Personality
Based on stories of his exploits, Rocks appeared to be an incredibly vicious and ambitious man, having no care as to who he attacked as long as he could garner power for himself and leading his crew to destroy whoever interfered with his ambitions. He was also quite fearless and indiscriminately ruthless, as he had no issue with killing
World Nobles
or their
slaves
if it suited his wishes. Rocks' dream was to become the
King of the World
(
世界の王
,
Sekai no Ō
?
)
, and he attacked many locations and left mass destruction in his wake to assert his dominance. He was also very curious about subjects that the
World Government
had kept hidden, resulting in him dabbling in those subjects.
According to
Whitebeard
, Rocks was rather careless in his pursuits, commonly losing sight of the tasks at hand and going off on his own.
Relationships
Allies
Crew
Despite being the
captain
of the
crew
, and even if they recognized its strength, in general, Rocks was not respected at all among his subordinates.
Charlotte Linlin
considered him to be untrustworthy and "good-for-nothing",
and
Whitebeard
mentioned having bad experiences with him and his crew.
Furthermore, Xebec appeared in
Kaidou
's memory when he was injured by Luffy, but only thought of him as someone capable of matching Kaidou in deadly combat, implying a hostile relationship.
Enemies
World Government
Since Rocks had the ambition to become the "king of the world", he was naturally opposed to the
World Government
as the current globe-ruling regime, including the
Celestial Dragons
, who were the focus of his attacks during the
God Valley Incident
.
Rocks' actions were destructive and anarchic enough that the Government considered him akin to a terrorist, meaning many of his feats were not properly recorded in history, causing Rocks to eventually fade from public consciousness save the memory of some veteran
Marines
and the former members of his crew.
Garp and Roger
Vice Admiral
Monkey D. Garp
and
Gol D. Roger
of the
Roger Pirates
were known to have joined forces to stop the Rocks Pirates during the God Valley Incident. That said, Garp is not fond of recounting this story despite its role in solidifying his reputation as a hero, since it involved him allying with a
pirate
and the fact that he only received said reputation because the Government suppressed the fact of Roger's involvement.
As well as the fact that he had to protect the World Nobles whom he hates and despises.
Abilities and Powers
Although Rocks' individual strength and abilities are unknown, he was well-reputed for presiding over a crew of extremely powerful
pirates
with clashing personalities and a lack of camaraderie, indicating that he was an extremely powerful and charismatic individual. Many of these people would go on to make big names for themselves after the crew's dissolution; "Whitebeard"
Edward Newgate
, "Big Mom"
Charlotte Linlin
, and
Kaidou
"King of the Beasts" came to constitute three quarters of the original
Four Emperors
, widely regarded as the strongest pirate crews in the world during the Golden Age of Piracy.
Kaidou envisions Xebec behind Luffy alongside other powerful people.
Many years after his death, Xebec is considered by some to be the first and most formidable rival of the Pirate King,
Gol D. Roger
, even more so than his then-subordinate Newgate would come to be.
He was so fearsome, it took the efforts of both Roger and
Monkey D. Garp
working together to finally defeat him. Rocks' defeat was also what caused Garp to become a legend and to be known as the
"Hero of the
Marines
"
, showing how much of a threat the
World Government
considered him to be.
Kaidou, who by the present has come to be called the world's
"Strongest Creature"
, included Xebec when he listed a very small number of notable figures that were worthy to stand against him in battle, alongside
Kouzuki Oden
,
Shanks
, Newgate, and Roger, further hinting at Xebec's might and threat.
Aside from raw strength, Rocks seemed to be a very intelligent and knowledgeable man, as, through studying many subjects that were considered taboo, he was able to unravel many of the World Government's secrets, which led the Government to decide to erase his name from history following his defeat.

History
Biography
Over 44 years ago,
Rocks and several other pirates arrived at the island of
Hachinosu
to meet and seek a path to fame and fortune. As a result of the meeting, Rocks took charge of this group, who called themselves the
Rocks Pirates
, and led them on a path of destruction with the goal of taking over the
world
.
Rocks and his crew against Roger and Garp.
38 years before the present, Rocks led his crew on a mission that endangered the
World Nobles
and their
slaves
during the
Native Hunting Competition
, looking to collect certain unnamed treasures. During this arrival at
God Valley
, Rocks appeared to have charged ahead of his crew as
Whitebeard
commented that he would lose sight of the task at hand. Around the same time,
Gol D. Roger
and his crew arrived to confront him for a past grievance; while unseen the two conversed with Rocks telling Roger not to get in his way.
Shortly after
Monkey D. Garp
and
Gol D. Roger
had formed an alliance to defeat the Rocks Pirates causing a
massive battle
to ensue. This event resulted in the dissolution of the crew. According to
Sengoku
, Rocks is no longer alive, though how and when he died is unspecified.
Legacy
Many of Rocks' subordinates would go on to become extremely notable
pirates
, particularly
Edward Newgate
,
Charlotte Linlin
, and
Kaidou
, who became three of the
Four Emperors
ruling over the
New World
.
Shiki
infamously clashed with the
Roger Pirates
multiple times and became the first documented inmate to escape
Impel Down
,
while
Captain
John
gathered a fabled
treasure
that's been sought for decades.
Rocks' place in history has been considerably diminished in the decades since his death, with many younger
Marines
being unaware of who he is. According to Sengoku, this lack of knowledge about him is mainly due to the
World Government
's intervention, as his path resulted in him dabbling in subjects they forbid. Additionally, due to the overall lack of camaraderie within the Rocks Pirates, most of Rocks' past subordinates are not inclined to talk about their time sailing with the crew.
Rocks' dream of taking over the
world
would be revived 38 years after his death, as his former subordinates Kaidou and Linlin decided to put aside their enmity with each other and form a
temporary alliance
to
conquer the world
.
This revived dream ultimately and quickly
fell apart
when both Linlin and Kaidou were defeated and eventually replaced as Emperors. In a twist of fate, the one to personally defeat Kaidou was
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Garp's grandson who wears
Roger's straw hat
and has been personally trained by the
Roger Pirates
' former
First Mate
,
Silvers Rayleigh
.
