Bell-mère
was a former
Marine
and the adoptive mother of
Nami
and
Nojiko
, introduced in a flashback during the
Arlong Park Arc
.
She raised the two girls for approximately nine years until she was murdered by
Arlong
.
Appearance
[
]
Bell-mère was a tall albeit slim woman with long fuchsia hair tied in a ponytail, grey eyes, and a rather unique hairstyle similar to a
mohawk
known as a Chelsea hawk (that Oda jokingly named "Women have guts!").
She wore a green checkered shirt with the word "MACE" on it, indigo trousers and brown sandals. She was also rarely seen without a cigarette.
Back in her days as a Marine, she wore the simple uniform with the officer's jacket draped over like a cape.
Personality
[
]
In her youth she was a renowned trouble maker. While her decision to join the Marines shocked all the villagers, they all cared deeply for her welfare despite the trouble that she had always given them. Due to her past, her decision to adopt her daughters led them to fear the children's own welfare. However, Bell-mère was determined to show them that she had grown into a mature adult who was capable of such responsibilities.
As a Marine, Bell-mère was quite confident, her reaction to
Shiki
's escape from Impel Down being to state that she will stop him herself should he attack the
East Blue
. Her fellow marines note that she is very reliable, indicating she was likely a very effective member of the Marines.
Bell-mère retains some of her mischievous nature upon her return to Cocoyasi, offering to pay Genzo for Nami's thefts "with her body" (this most likely explaining where Nami got her personality from, as Nami even used the phrase when Genzo captured her, much to his frustration), despite knowing how he reacts. She occasionally acts impulsively, such as when she hits Nami for suggesting that Nojiko is not her real sister, and hits a boy for saying that her mikans taste bad moments after Bell-mère stated to Nami she shouldn't have hit the boy. She admits that Nojiko is sometimes more mature than she is.
Relationships
[
]
Friends
[
]
Despite the problems she caused, she had a good relationship with everyone, especially
Genzo.
She was able to manipulate him through some seductive moves that leave him extremely embarrassed, even saying that she would pay him back with "her body" (largely implying to him an offer of sexual advancement). Genzo knew her beyond her and dubbed her the "little hooligan" in response to her troubles. He was horrified after seeing Arlong mercilessly kill her.
Family
[

Nami and Nojiko
[

Nami, Bell-mère, and Nojiko together.
Bell-mère was close to death and was going to accept it before a two-year-old Nojiko appeared carrying an infant Nami. Seeing Nami's blissful ignorance to the carnage that surrounded them gave Bell-mère life and she took the two girls with her and returned home to the village during a storm and selflessly demanded that they should be treated before her.
Her history gave her an advantage in dealing with Nami's own antics at times, however she could not change the fact that she and her daughters were not related by blood and therefore was unable to handle Nami rejecting her family completely. Nevertheless, she cared about her daughters deeply, she would give her daughters as much as she could afford to, often at her own expense. This was proven when times were harsh she ate only the fruit she grew in her grove, thus saving enough money to keep feeding her daughters on suitable meals and would lie about being on a "diet" to hide it. Her only regret she had was she could not give them everything they wanted in life. However, she loved them both as though they were her own. To ensure Nami and Nojiko's safety, Bell-mère decided to sacrifice her own life. During her last moments, Bell-mère told her foster daughters that she loved them before Arlong shot her.
Abilities and Powers

Bell-mère shows her skill when she pins fish-man Arlong to the ground with her rifle.
Bell-mère has fought many pirates throughout her time as marine and gathered enough battle experience to survive. She was perceptive enough to notice that Arlong and his crew were coming for her, despite being distracted by cooking. She also acrobatically managed to pin Arlong on the ground and place a rifle in his mouth, before he or anyone in his crew could react.
Weapons

She wielded a
rifle
against Arlong with considerably quick maneuvers (possibly taken from her Marine service), though Arlong easily broke it with his

Early Life
[
]
Bell-mère was a trouble maker throughout her entire life, causing everyone to refer to her as a "thug". Despite that, they cared deeply for her well being, and when she chose to join the Marines, they were completely shocked by her sudden decision. Though they tried to convince her to change her mind, she was set on fighting "bad" pirates.
Upon learning that the infamous pirate,
Shiki
had escaped from
Impel Down
, Bell-mère boldly stated that she would be the one to take him down if he were to come to the
East Blue
.
Meeting her Daughters
[

Bell-mère arriving at Cocoyasi Village during a storm with Nami and Nojiko.
One day she and fellow Marines were sent to the
Oykot Kingdom
to fight some pirates causing trouble there. The fight was bloody, leaving many dead and destroying the village which the two sides were fighting in. As Bell-mère lay wounded, she decided that it was alright to let herself die there and then. However, just as she was giving up and letting herself go,
Nojiko
appeared carrying
Nami
. Bell-mère took the two back to her village (with Nami too young to be aware of what happened).
Upon arrival, a storm had broken out over Bell-mère's home island and the two children had grown ill. She insisted the two girls get treatment before her. Later, after all three of them were better again, she asked the other villagers not to register the girls for adoption with the
World Government
. She declared (with many protests from the other villagers) that she was old and mature enough to look after the girls herself.
Retired Life
[
]
Bell-mère lived with the girls on her mikan grove in
Cocoyasi Village
. While Bell-mère had very little income, she gave everything to her girls and survived by eating the mikans she grew. One day, Bell-mère scolded Nami when she got caught stealing a book because, as the child knew they could not afford it. Nami revealed to Bell-mère that she stole the book because she was studying navigation. Bell-mère applauded Nami's first drawing of the island as the first step of her dream to map the world, and gave Nami the faith that she really could do it. While Nami and Nojiko were growing up, Bell-mère advised them that they had to be as strong as boys, and if they survived, good times would come.
When one year the price of mikans fell due to a large supply, Bell-mère had to eat only mikans and gave most of the food to Nami and Nojiko, but did not reveal how bad the situation was to her daughters. One day, Nami was given one of Nojiko's dresses by Bell-mère (who simply turned the sunflower on it into a lion) and Nami was offended. Nami wanted her own clothes, not Nojiko's hand-me-downs. During the argument, Nami said she did not consider Nojiko a real sister because they weren't blood related, causing Bell-mère to slap her. Nami then ran off, saying that she wished she were adopted by rich people. Bell-mère realized she wasn't acting like an adult, so she decided to spare some money and prepare Nami's favorite meal even though it would hurt her budget. She sent Nojiko to fetch Nami while she prepared the meal.
Arrival of Arlong
[
]
Bell-mère trying to protect her daughters.
That same day,
Arlong
and
his pirates
invaded the island and found her home. Bell-mère noticed, and as soon as Arlong knocked on the door, she knocked him down and put the barrel of the gun in his mouth. She then claimed to have been a Marine and asked what the Grand Line pirates had come here to do. Arlong laughed at human helplessness and chewed on the barrel of Bell-mère's rifle, then smashed her arm into the ground, drawing blood. Genzo yelled at her that he shouldn't lose his life just for pride and that certain problems could be solved with money, and then supported her.
When Arlong told him that each adult had to pay a tribute of
100,000 and
50,000 for each child, he thought he had just over
100,000. He then heard
Hatchan
reveal to his captain that the table was set for three, so Genzo told Bell-mère to hurry up and pay for an adult as he had invited them to eat otherwise the food would get cold. The woman paid, but while the fish-men left, having understood from her experience as a former marine that Arlong would ensure that there was no other way than to submit, she stated that this sum was for her daughters and that therefore she lacked her share; as she would rather die than not call herself a mother. To that end, Arlong shot her right in front of the eyes of her two adopted daughters, but not before Bell-mère apologized to Nami for not being richer and not being able to buy the girls whatever they wanted. The two insisted that it was not the case and urged her to stay alive. Before she died, she told the girls "I love you."
Postmortem
[
]
Bell-mère's body was buried on a nearby cliff outside of the village, with a pair of sticks tied in a cross to act as her grave marker. Some time before or during the timeskip, Belle-mere was given a proper grave with her name inscribed on the headstone.
Legacy
[
]
After Bell-mère's death, Nami was forced to join Arlong's crew for her cartography skills, which they planned to use to create sea charts to help them conquer the East Blue. Bell-mère's advice that "If you can survive, then happy times... lots of them... will come your way" encourages Nami to work to buy Cocoyasi Village from Arlong, believing that once she freed the village, she could pursue her dream and find happiness.
She always hid the money at Bell-mère's mikan orchard. The villagers, and especially Bell-mère's daughters, would visit her grave every so often.
But unfortunately, eight years after Bell-mère's death, it is then revealed that Arlong tricked Nami into bringing him the money he needed to pay off
Nezumi
to keep quiet about his activities, leaving Nami in total despair that she and her village will never be free. However, soon after that, Arlong and his crew met their defeat at the hands of Nami's new found friends, the
Straw Hat Pirates
, thus finally setting the entire island free. They also beat up Nezumi and his subordinates when he attempted to intervene and forced him to return the money he took. Genzo celebrated by pouring wine on her grave marker, while Nami set sail alongside the Straw Hats, having a renewed view on pirates.
On the night that Nami prepared to leave her hometown to become a true member of the Straw Hat Pirates, she said her good-byes to Bell-mère inside her old house, imagining that she was speaking to her face directly. Nami felt some regret about departing Cocoyasi Village for a long term journey on the Grand Line, remembering how much it meant to her, and it was hard to let it go so easily. However, when Nami walked out of her house, she received a forceful nudge on her back from a hand as she stepped out of the doorway. It was the spirit of Bell-mère encouraging Nami to get going already. Nami smiled, knowing who pushed her, and left the village the next day eager to begin her quest to chart the world.
In the
Punk Hazard Arc
, when Nami left the care of the giant children to the Marines, particularly
Tashigi
, because she trusted Marine women,
Usopp
remarked this was because she was raised by one.
