Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, Soro is given only a brief mention (and implied to have attacked Rika out on the street); the anime expands this to a full flashback, depicting Helmeppo and Soro harassing customers in a tavern owned by Rika and her
mother
, and Rika feebly trying to drive the wolf out with a broom. Soro's fate is also softened, with Zoro throwing a stool at him instead of cutting him down; the dialogue was changed accordingly, and it remains unconfirmed if he was in fact killed.
