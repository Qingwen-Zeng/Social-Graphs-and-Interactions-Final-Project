Ageha Woman
is a
Gifter
in the
Beasts Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Ageha Woman is a woman of average size, with purple hair. Due to the
SMILE
that she consumed, she possesses large butterfly wings from her back, antennae on her head, and a yellow scarf of some sort around her neck. Unlike other Gifters, she does not possess a pair of horns. She wears a pink flower-spotted leotard, with white gloves and red boots.
Personality
[
]
Like most pirates, Ageha Woman seems to revel in causing violence and chaos. She had little issue working with her allies to blow up various ships and infrastructure on Orochi's orders
. Also, while her ally Hawkman was gloating about their success in apparently stopping the rebellion, she didn't miss the opportunity to paint a grim picture, adding on that the rebels would die slowly and painfully, showing a darker side.
Abilities and Powers

Ageha Woman seems quite capable of fighting, given her status as a Gifter.

SMILE
As a Gifter, Ageha Woman has consumed a Swallowtail Butterfly SMILE
(
アゲハチョウの
SMILE
,
Agehachō no Sumairu
?
)
, giving her the power of flight through the butterfly wings on her back.
Weapons
[
]
During she and her partner's bomb run on Wano, Ageha Woman carried a
rifle
of some sort, which she apparently used to blow up various things around the country.
In the anime, she is given some sort of chain with bombs attached to it. She later uses a pair of daggers to try and attack Law, but fails in the attempt to do so.
History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
On the night before the
Raid on Onigashima
, Ageha Woman was dispatched alongside her allies
Hawkman
and
Koshi Falcon
by the
Shogun
Orochi
to blow up the
Thousand Sunny
, as well as various other ships and infrastructure all around
Wano Country
. The order was given with the intent to stop the rebel forces in Wano, which the trio had no issue with, and promptly did as asked.
On the night of the raid, Ageha Woman confronted the
Straw Hat Pirates
and their allies directly, landing alongside Hawkman as he gloated to their enemies. While Hawkman went on to explain how victory was impossible for the rebels, Ageha Woman added on that all of them were going to die the next day after the celebration. Moments later, as a result of Hawkman's gloating,
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Eustass Kid
, and
Trafalgar D. Water Law
easily made their way aboard the ship, before unleashing separate attacks to sink it. Ageha Woman managed to avoid being harmed, getting off of the ship before it was sunk.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Ageha Woman is defeated by Law.
In the anime, her actual interactions with the Straw Hats are extended significantly, with she and her two partners attacking the Sunny with various explosives. While she was clearly still fine after the Worst Generation trio attacked in the manga, in the anime she is explicitly defeated by Law.
