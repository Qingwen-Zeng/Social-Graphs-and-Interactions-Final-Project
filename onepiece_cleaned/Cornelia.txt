History

Making their Mark
[
]
Cornelia joined the
Spade Pirates
and traveled with
Portgas D. Ace
as he made a name for himself. He helped fight off a group of
bounty hunters
, and, when
Isuka
infiltrated the crew's ship, Cornelia surrounded the
Marine Ensign
alongside his crewmates. However, Isuka easily fended them off. After the confrontation, the crew reached
Sabaody Archipelago
. While they waited for their ship to be
coated
, Cornelia and his crewmates explored the island and secretly read
Masked Deuce
's adventure diary. They laughed at his poor writing skills, leading Deuce to exclude their names from the diary.
At one point, the Spade Pirates were shipwrecked in
Wano Country
. The people from
Amigasa Village
were starving to death, so they tied the entire crew and stole all their food. The crew watched the villagers finish their meal and then broke out. Instead of attacking, Ace asked the villagers where he could get them dessert. They stayed in Amigasa Village for a few weeks and became good friends with
Tama
.
They also went to
Onigashima
to liberate the abducted children from the
Beasts Pirates
. They never encountered
Kaidou
and his top subordinates because they were away on an expedition. After Ace did so much damage to
Kaidou's castle
, they rescued the children and met
Yamato
, with whom Ace had a brief scuffle.
Encountering Whitebeard
[
]
The Spade Pirates prepare to fight Whitebeard.
After Ace and
Jinbe
tied, Cornelia and the other Spade Pirates defended their captain against
Edward Newgate
and were easily defeated. They were then taken into the
Whitebeard Pirates
like their captain.
Cornelia has not been seen since his joining.
