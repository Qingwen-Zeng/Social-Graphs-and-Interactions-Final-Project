Dressrosa Arc
, he retired from
piracy
and became a dyer.
When he made his debut, he had a
bounty

55,000,000
and was known as the "Big-Time Rookie" within
Mock Town
.
After the timeskip, his bounty has increased to
195,000,000.

Appearance
[
]
Bellamy is a tall man with tan skin and short, unkempt blond hair. During the Jaya Arc, he wore white pants, a green sash with markings, and a pink sleeveless shirt with a navy blue
pirate captain
's coat over it. The coat tended to fall off whenever Bellamy used his spring-based jumping.
He has a scar above his right eye and tattoos of eye-like designs on his arms. He has a trademark grin and sometimes sticks out his tongue in a taunting manner.
After the timeskip, he grew in size dramatically. He now wears a pair of black sunglasses and bears two new scars, one across each side of his face, possibly from either his humiliating defeat by
Luffy
or from
Doflamingo
's punishment, or both. He has discarded his captain's coat and now wears a short sleeved shirt with his old jolly roger on the back (now painted over with a cross), which is left open to display Doflamingo's mark tattooed on his chest.

Personality
[
]
Before he visited an unnamed sky island, Bellamy was characterized as violent and conceited. He was very arrogant and highly confident in his own powers. He would only attack foes he thought he could win against, and this attitude led to his eventual defeat at Monkey D. Luffy's hands; Bellamy thought he was weak, not knowing that he had recently defeated a member of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
,
Crocodile
, and obtained a new bounty of
100,000,000 he earned, before moving into Jaya. He loved to have an audience to witness his feats.
He was ruthless, as he attacked
Roshio
over a trivial matter and laughed at other people's misfortune. Like
Donquixote Doflamingo
, he heavily believed in the "New Age" and thought it would soon come after what he calls the "Age of Dreams", the current era in which people dream of finding
One Piece
and becoming the
Pirate King
. His philosophy of the "
New Age
" led him to taunt and laugh at anyone with such grand dreams as Luffy's; little did Bellamy know that Doflamingo himself aspired to become the Pirate King. Indeed, his cruelty is well known even in the New World, after the timeskip, even though he changed a lot.
Bellamy's arrogance tended to heavily influence his opinions of what the world presents before him; this became evident when he dismissed the possibility that there was someone stronger than him during his stay at Jaya when
Jobo
presented him and his crew with Luffy and Zoro's new
bounties
. Like the rest of his crew, Bellamy misinterpreted that a bounty represented a person's fighting level, causing him to believe he was fearsome despite his bounty being only a little higher than average based on Grand Line standards. His crew did nothing to discourage that belief and even went as far as to give him the nickname "Big-Time Rookie". As a result, he seemed to consider himself destined for greatness.
Bellamy earned his nickname from his trademark grin, constant laughter, and reputation for scavenging riches from other
pirates
, much like a hyena scavenges its food. He and
Sarquiss
usually hunted down pirates who were weaker than them, beat them mercilessly, let the rest of the crew "pick up the trash", and then robbed them of their treasures while mocking them.
After the two-year timeskip, Bellamy has lost much of his arrogance and gained a cold, calm demeanor. He no longer mocks people, as his only ambition was to become Doflamingo's right-hand man. However, he still appears to relish battle, as seen in his fights with
Tank Lepanto
and with
Abdullah
and
Jeet
, wherein the commentator noted his viciousness. In addition, he has become much more observant, as he was able to recognize Luffy through his disguise,
and promised not to laugh at him anymore.
He also has a strong sense of honor, as he was disgusted by the fact that Tank Lepanto had accepted a bribe, and after the match he told Luffy that by cheering him on he had crushed his pride. More of this reformed personality was shown when he showed reluctance to fulfill Doflamingo's order to kill Luffy.
Bellamy trying to force a smile.
Bellamy was immensely loyal to Doflamingo, a man he had admired and idolized since his youth. He briefly refused to believe that Doflamingo had ordered
Dellinger
to finish him off in case he failed, and even after realizing it was true, he refused to betray the man he respected. After confronting Doflamingo and being brutally beaten, Bellamy lost his will to live and begged to be killed. Even after Doflamingo told Bellamy just how little he thought of him and
forced
him to fight Luffy, he did not let go of his loyalty, choosing to attack Luffy even after Doflamingo's control was lifted. Though he realized that his admiration was misplaced and considered himself a fool, Bellamy held on to his principles. Forcing a smile, he claimed that he would keep seeking Doflamingo's approval by taking Luffy down with him but winced when Luffy pointed out that Doflamingo probably knew that Bellamy would try to fight him to the death. After Doflamingo's downfall, Bellamy seemed to forgo his loyalty towards Doflamingo, given Bellamy's newfound friendship with Luffy.
Having finally foregone his loyalty to Doflamingo, Bellamy chose to change his ways and quit piracy to find a new life as an apprentice dyer.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Like their captain, the
Bellamy Pirates
were attempting to usher in a "New Age" wherein all pirates would abandon "dream" treasures and instead focus on the treasures present all around them, hoarding them from weaker pirates. As a captain, Bellamy was looking for strong pirates to join his cause. All of his crewmen admired him and called him a big-time rookie.
Sarquiss
was proud of his captain and confident in his abilities. Even after Bellamy's defeat, Sarquiss still believed Luffy's victory was by sheer luck, stubbornly refusing to accept that someone could be stronger than his captain.
When Bellamy was defeated, most of the new recruits to his crew fled. The only ones that remained were the primary crew members, not because they were angry after seeing their captain defeated, but because they were appalled at the turn of events. Even Sarquiss, the second-in-command, was in such a state of panic that he could not think straight upon his captain's downfall. When the top two were forced by Doflamingo to fight each other, the rest of the crew was too overwhelmed by fear and confusion to try to stop them.
During his discussion with Luffy at
Dressrosa
, Bellamy stated he lost his crew during his journey to
Sky Island
.
Donquixote Pirates
[
]
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
Bellamy had greatly admired
Donquixote Doflamingo
since childhood.
As captain of the
Bellamy Pirates
, he wasted little time in formally pledging loyalty to the
Donquixote Pirates
, gaining permission to use their
Jolly Roger
(in tandem with their own) as well as adopting Doflamingo's cynical philosophy. However, Doflamingo returned little—if any—of this respect. At the slightest news of weakness from Bellamy, Doflamingo personally rebuked him for "dishonoring" the Donquixote flag, declared that he had no use for the crew, and promptly forced Bellamy and Sarquiss to fight to the death.
After the timeskip, Bellamy was given another chance by Doflamingo for bringing him a gold pillar from Skypiea. He was given a chance to participate in the
Corrida Colosseum
, and his prize for winning the tournament would be a position as one of the leaders of the Donquixote Pirates. Unfortunately, for Bellamy, his admiration for Doflamingo was misplaced. After Bellamy lost the tournament, Doflamingo seemed to have given him one more opportunity for an executive position, but actually ordered Dellinger to dispose of him like garbage. Though heartbroken by this betrayal, Bellamy claimed that he still respected Doflamingo and would never turn against him.
However, after confronting Doflamingo during his "Birdcage" game, Bellamy was horrified to hear Doflamingo's desire to destroy the world before being brutally assaulted by him, an attack to which he could only respond with tears. Doflamingo mocked Bellamy for being weak, cruelly used him as a human shield against Luffy, and finally forced him to attack his new friend against his will. Bellamy became shocked upon learning that Doflamingo was a World Noble, shot his own father and attempted to regain his status by bringing his head back to Mary Geoise, and planned to destroy the world that the World Nobles own. Regardless of all of this, even knowing that he put his faith in the wrong man, Bellamy refused to abandon his loyalty to Doflamingo just because he didn't get the answers he sought.
After Doflamingo and his crew's downfall, Bellamy seemed to forgo his loyalty towards him.
Dellinger
[
]
Bellamy appeared to be familiar with the officer, as he was annoyed by his presence while trying to assassinate Luffy. After revealing that his order was to kill Bellamy, Dellinger severely wounded him, but he was stopped by Bartolomeo before he could finish the job. After being called away by Diamante, Dellinger swore to Bellamy and Bartolomeo that they wouldn't leave the island alive.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Luffy
,
Zoro
, and
Nami
arrived in the town where Bellamy was, searching for information about the legendary Sky Island. Bellamy wanted to see if Luffy was worthy of joining him, but as soon as Nami asked for information on the sky island, he rejected that notion and instead taunted them along with the rest of his crew. However, even when the taunts escalated to violence, Luffy and Zoro chose not to fight back. After they left, Bellamy decided they were too weak to be worth following.
Bellamy heard that
Mont Blanc Cricket
had uncovered some gold and subsequently decided to take it from him. He and his crew thoroughly assaulted the
Saruyama Alliance
and took the gold back to Mock Town. Seeking revenge, Luffy went back to fight Bellamy and took him out in one punch. Upon seeing this, all the pirates that the Bellamy Pirates managed to recruit ran off in terror, leaving the main crew with their unconscious captain, utterly shocked at Bellamy's defeat and unable to take action against the perpetrator. This defeat was the reason Doflamingo decided to punish Bellamy personally, despite him telling Doflamingo that the only reason he harassed the Straw Hats was because he feared that they would eventually cross paths with and become a threat to him someday.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Back at Mock Town, Bellamy held little to no respect for Luffy, openly mocking his beliefs in regard to legends and dreams. Later on in a fight, Bellamy continued with his mockery and angered Luffy, who soon gave him a well-deserved punch. After his humiliating defeat at the hands of Luffy, however, Bellamy changed and became more open-minded to the idea of following one's dream.
Bellamy and Luffy reunite in Dressrosa.
At the Corrida Colosseum, Bellamy recognized Luffy in spite of his
disguise
.
Bellamy showed more respect for Luffy than he had on Jaya, having been to Sky Island himself at this point. He said that he held no grudges against Luffy and vowed to never laugh at him again.
Later, when it looked as though Bellamy was going to lose to Bartolomeo, Luffy cheered Bellamy on.
After losing the first round, Bellamy still spoke to Luffy on friendly terms. He seemed unhappy and reluctant when Doflamingo ordered him to kill Luffy.
After Doflamingo's ruthless assault on Bellamy, Luffy showed compassion toward the beaten and heart-broken man, and refused to hurt him when Doflamingo forced him to fight Luffy. When Luffy called Bellamy his friend, Bellamy couldn't help bursting into tears. Upon being freed from Doflamingo's manipulation, Bellamy forced Luffy to fight him, refusing to betray his principles. Even when Luffy refused to fight back, Bellamy showed no signs of relenting and kept pummeling him. Eventually, Luffy was forced to fight back and with some hesitation defeated Bellamy with a single blow. In his thoughts, Bellamy thanked Luffy for calling him a friend while Luffy furiously yelled Doflamingo's name.
Bellamy's thoughts during the fight showed that Luffy was the one other person besides Doflamingo that Bellamy looked up to.
After Doflamingo was defeated, Bellamy parted ways with Luffy by refusing to be his subordinate like those who joined the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
, but not before stating he would keep a piece of the
Vivre Card
just in case he got into trouble.
Other
[
]
Saruyama Alliance
[
]
While the Straw Hats were in Jaya's forest looking for a
South Bird
, the Bellamy Pirates attacked, stealing the gold artifacts that acted as their only proof of the golden city's existence. Angered, Luffy defeated Bellamy and returned the gold to Cricket before setting off for the sky island.
Bartolomeo
[
]
Although Bellamy fought against Bartolomeo during B Block, he was later saved by the rookie, who stopped
Dellinger
from killing him. Bellamy angrily stated that his life was a waste and tearfully asked Bartolomeo why he would save him from death. Bartolomeo replied that by fighting together, they had become friends, and he wouldn't leave a friend to die.
Trafalgar Law
[
]
Despite Bellamy only talking with Law once, they appear to be civil with each other. Bellamy questioned why Law would save him, and Law responded that it was because Luffy considered him a friend.
Dressrosa
[
]
Because he was "personally handpicked" by Doflamingo and a steadfast loyalist to him, Bellamy was very popular in
Dressrosa
where Doflamingo himself was the well-beloved king. People admired Bellamy, as he has apparently crushed countries that messed with Dressrosa, calling him the "Bullet of Dressrosa". He was a crowd favorite in the tournament and the most acclaimed by the public in B Block.
The injuries he received from the unpopular
Bartolomeo
made the crowd worry, and upon being defeated by
Elizabello II
, the crowd cried out.
Even the commentator of the Corrida Colosseum,
Gatz
, was a fan of Bellamy, and saw him as a hero of Dressrosa.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Prior to the timeskip, Bellamy appeared to be an average fighter without the aid of his
Bane Bane no Mi
, upon which he heavily depended. Bellamy easily defeated
Shoujou
, who had a bounty of
36,000,000, and
Roshio
, who had a bounty of
42,000,000; both fights were won thanks to his Bane Bane no Mi.
However, he had enough talent to receive a bounty of
55,000,000 and also possessed enough talent to be accepted as a subordinate by
Doflamingo
.
Before becoming a full-time member of the
Donquixote Pirates
, Bellamy was not a particularly powerful pirate. He usually only enjoyed attacking opponents whose bounties and strength were inferior to his own in order to intimidate others. In addition to being known as "The Big-Time Rookie", when his bounty was technically below
Grand Line
standards.
After the timeskip, his overall abilities have improved. After losing to Luffy, he began to improve by surviving
Sky Island
and returning with a large golden pillar, which he presented to Doflamingo and having attacked many countries that messed with
Dressrosa
.
Furthermore, he was able to survive in the New World, with his bounty rising to
195,000,000, more than triple his first known bounty. All of this gave him a second chance in the Donquixote Pirates.
Bellamy was considered one of the favorites to win the final B block, so much so that
Dagama
advised his allies to defeat him first as he was considered one of the strongest.
Despite this, his strength seems considerably inferior to the true officers of the crew, as Doflamingo, once he changed his mind again, sent
Dellinger
to kill him.
Intellectually, he became far more perceptive, as he instantly recognized Luffy through his heavy disguise, a feat most of the other contestants within the room could not manage even when Luffy inadvertently blurted out his identity.
He also managed to deduce
Bartolomeo
's
Bari Bari no Mi
's weakness after a few of his direct attacks were deflected. He was ultimately knocked out by
King Elizabello
's "King Punch" before he could exploit this weakness, though he regained consciousness soon after the match ended and was seen talking to Luffy.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Despite his preference for his spring-based strength, he had enough brute strength to destroy a bar and easily toss a full-grown man clean out of a window. However, he lacked endurance and was knocked out by a single punch from Luffy (though he was travelling at high speed). When Doflamingo appeared in order to punish the crew for dishonoring his flag, Bellamy was completely powerless to stop him as he forced Sarquiss to attack Bellamy with his
human puppeteer abilities
.
Sometime within the two years after the
Summit War of Marineford
, Bellamy's strength increased tremendously. He was strong enough to crush the face of a fellow participant with his bare hands.
He also managed to take out
Abdullah
and
Jeet
simultaneously even though they were dangerous enough to terrorize most of their opponents in B Block.
His endurance has also increased exponentially, having taken damage from his fight with
Bartolomeo
, Elizabello II's
King Punch
(though he did briefly pass out from this), and
Dellinger
and Doflamingo's assaults all in the same day before finally falling unconscious from a Armament Haki-hardened Gear Second punch from Luffy.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Bane Bane no Mi
Bellamy turning his legs into springs.
Bellamy ate the Bane Bane no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform his body and limbs into springs. The force created by the compression and release of the springs greatly enhances his offensive power and mobility. Additionally, the boinging noise created by the springs can be utilized to disorient his opponents.
He can transform his legs into springs, allowing him to jump with great speed, height, distance, and force. This allows him to launch himself at high speed, allowing him to bounce around the battlefield faster than the eye can see, allowing him to evade enemy attacks and get in close to attack his opponents. His bouncing also gives him high momentum that he can utilize to augment his punches.
By transforming his arm into a spring, he can compress his arm and release it at the moment of contact, resulting in a very powerful punch.
Weapons
[
]
Bellamy used a knife and pistol to brutalize Roshio.
Bellamy also used a pair of knives to stab both
Abdullah
and
Jeet
in their feet, pinning them to the ground and immobilizing them, in order to execute further attacks.
When Bellamy was controlled by
Doflamingo
, he wielded a pair of rapier-like swords.
Haki
[
]
Further information:
Haki
Armament Haki
[
]
Bellamy imbues his fist with Armament Haki.
During his battle with Luffy in the Dressrosa Royal Palace, Bellamy demonstrated the ability to use
Armament Haki
to harden his fist. By combining this with the force gained from
Spring Hopper
, Bellamy was able to punch Luffy with enough power to break through the latter's own Haki-hardened abs, causing him to cough up blood.
Observation Haki
[
]
Bellamy possesses the ability to use
Observation Haki
.
During the B Block fight, Bellamy was able to sense the incoming strength of
Elizabello II
's King Punch despite having his back turned to him.
After the B Block fight, Bellamy used this ability once more to measure's Luffy own strength and Haki.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Bellamy and his original crewmen were all born in the
North Blue
, specifically in the peaceful town of
Notice
. During their childhood, they heard the fairy tale
Liar Noland
and were often told by adults that if they lied a lot, they'd be executed like Noland.
Sometime in his youth, Bellamy tired of his "boring" hometown, formed the
Bellamy Pirates
with
Sarquiss
as his right-hand man, and set out to sea. The crew approached the infamous pirate (and future
Warlord of the Sea
)
Donquixote Doflamingo
and, after expressing their admiration, received permission to use the
Donquixote Family
's
symbol
; however, Doflamingo warned that defeat would not be tolerated. Bellamy swore that he would not lose to anyone.
Bellamy enjoyed a meteoric rise on the
Grand Line
, earned a bounty of
55,000,000, for which he was known as "The Big-Time Rookie."
Eventually, Bellamy and his crew landed on the island of
Jaya
, looking for more powerful pirates to recruit for the "New Age". As a base of operations they commandeered
Mock Town
's Tropical Hotel, intimidating its proprietor
Spector
into refusing all other guests.
Sky Island Saga
[
]
Jaya Arc
[
]
Bellamy took well to Mock Town's lawless environment: on losing a game of cards to
Roshio the Executioner
at the Wild Cherry pub, Bellamy quickly accused him of cheating, and savagely attacked with knife, pistol, and a bottle of liquor that
Sarquiss
helped ignite. As the resulting blast flung Roshio out the window, Bellamy pursued and finished off the rival captain with his
Spring Hopper
technique.
Bellamy initiates his "test" on Luffy.
Later that day, Bellamy learned from Sarquiss that the
Straw Hat Pirates
, captained by
30,000,000 bounty-head
Monkey D. Luffy
, had also arrived on Jaya. Intrigued, Bellamy found Luffy,
Zoro
and
Nami
at
Terry
's pub and struck up conversation, even treating Luffy to a meal. As the rest of his men gathered, Bellamy spontaneously smashed the younger pirate's head into the bar counter, meaning to test the Straw Hats' strength with a staged fight.
Though Luffy and Zoro were ready to retaliate, Bellamy quickly lost interest on hearing of their search for
Sky Island
—one of the "dream" treasures his crew so scorned. Leading the whole pub in mockery, Bellamy dismissed all such legends, including
One Piece
, as rumors and exaggerations unworthy of any "real" pirate. This in turn caused Luffy to lose any interest in Bellamy, and order Zoro to do the same.
Not realizing that Luffy and Zoro had simply judged them beneath attention, the Bellamy Pirates attacked and humiliated the duo until an outraged Nami dragged them away.
Later still, Bellamy learned of
Mont Blanc Noland
's salvage operation on Jaya's opposite coast, and its successful gold discoveries. Scorning Noland and
his followers
as similarly worthless dreamers, Bellamy led his crew on a night raid, savagely beating the salvagers and taking the gold for themselves.
Ironically, this regained the attention of the Straw Hats, who had befriended Noland that very afternoon.
Bellamy and his crew attack the Saruyama Alliance.
Back at the bar, Bellamy and crew were laughing it up over their recent assault on Mont Blanc Cricket. Just then, the town drunk rushed in with wanted posters and news that Bellamy was in great danger. The two men that he and his crew attacked in the bar were Roronoa Zoro and Monkey D. Luffy, pirates with bounties of
60,000,000 and
100,000,000 respectively. Everyone in the bar was shocked except for Bellamy, who arrogantly claimed that the wanted posters were forgeries created by the two men in an effort to scare him into giving up in a fight with them. This caused the bar to calm down until Luffy's angry shout shocked them again.
Bellamy walked out to see who was calling and saw Luffy on a building. When Luffy told him to return the stolen gold, Bellamy used his Bane Bane powers to get up on the roof as well. He told him that since he stole the gold, it was rightfully his, but Luffy told him that he was going to steal it back.
Bellamy is defeated by Luffy.
Bellamy continued to mock Luffy as the drunkard became more and more distressed, but Sarquiss told him to knock it off, starting to doubt that even Luffy's
30,000,000 bounty was real. Bellamy wondered aloud whether Luffy would fight or if he was just going to stand around like their last encounter. When Luffy told him that the last time was different, Bellamy started the fight by using his powers to jump off the building and crack the tower in two.
Bellamy mostly showed off by repeatedly using his
Spring Snipe
technique, making single bouncing shots toward Luffy. Even with this intimidating provocation, Luffy did not lift a finger towards Bellamy, nor did he take any damage. After a few more attacks on Luffy, Bellamy readied a serious shot using his
Spring Hopper
technique. Bellamy began ricocheting around the town, bouncing faster and faster, creating an almost deafening chorus of boi-oi-oings that echoed through the entire town.
While he was powering up his attack, Bellamy endlessly insulted Luffy and Cricket over their persistent dreams and ridiculous belief in the sky island, visibly angering Luffy. For his final attack, Bellamy rocketed toward Luffy, but with a single punch, Luffy smashed Bellamy to the ground, leaving an imprint of his knuckles on the right side of his face and knocking him completely unconscious.
His crew quickly realized that Luffy's wanted posters were the real thing and ran away.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
A day later, Bellamy had recovered from his defeat, just in time to hear the ringing of the
Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell
after Luffy defeated
Enel
, and witnessed the magnified shadow Luffy cast from far up in the clouds as he celebrated his victory. Bellamy realized that not only did Sky Islands truly exist, but that Luffy had actually had made it to Skypiea while others had failed. Overwhelmed at what he was witnessing, he knew he had been wrong this whole time and had wronged Luffy by mocking and attacking him. Henceforth, Bellamy began to admire and respect Luffy.

Bellamy forced to fight with Sarquiss.
News of Bellamy's defeat spread quickly, and within three days Doflamingo personally descended on Mock Town to deliver punishment, using
his powers
to force Bellamy into a deathmatch against Sarquiss. Knowing he had disgraced the Donquixote flag, Bellamy could only argue that he had been trying to prevent the Straw Hats from posing a future threat to Doflamingo, and beg in vain for another chance. Unconcerned, Doflamingo declared that Bellamy was no longer needed, made Sarquiss land a finishing blow, and left the remnants of the Bellamy Pirates in helpless terror.
Against all odds, however, Bellamy survived.
During The Timeskip
[
]
Bellamy presents a gold pillar to Doflamingo.
After his punishment, Bellamy took his crew to visit a
Sky Island
. Though his men did not survive the trip, he retrieved a pillar of gold, confirming that he made it to
Skypiea
and managed to return to the surface land and present the pillar to Doflamingo, which successfully redeemed his standing and gained another chance in the Donquixote Pirates.
During this time he has apparently attacked countries that opposed Dressrosa.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Bellamy entered the
Corrida Colosseum
to compete for a leadership position in the
Donquixote Family
and was assigned to B Block. He is first seen somewhere in the Colosseum crushing someone's skull.
Before B Block began, Bellamy recognized Luffy despite his disguise. After a small chat, Luffy recognized him as the man who beat up Mont Blanc Cricket, though he got Bellamy's name wrong until he was corrected. Luffy asked him why he was here. Bellamy said that he did not live on Jaya and thus could go wherever he wanted. He said that he had worshipped Doflamingo ever since he was young and did not care about the
Mera Mera no Mi
. All that mattered to him was winning. Bellamy proceeded to explain how he visited a sky island and how he changed as a person after that. As he walked off, he told Luffy that he no longer considered there to be any bad blood between them; all he wanted was to join Doflamingo's crew.
Having said his piece, Bellamy then proceeded to go into the ring. Bellamy was trying to decide where to begin when he saw several fighters get thrown back.
Tank Lepanto
,
Elizabello II
, and
Dagama
discussed if they should take out Bellamy first, to which the tactician said yes, as they must take out the stronger fighters while they still had numbers on their side. Bellamy asked what they are doing, and Bartolomeo remarked that the battle was not really a battle royale anymore.
Bellamy defeats Abdullah and Jeet.
Bellamy then came face to face with Dressrosa's Self-Defense army commander,
Tank Lepanto
. Bellamy asked him why he was assisting fighters from a foreign country. Lepanto responded by saying that he was only fighting for money and attempted to strike Bellamy with a spike ball chain. Bellamy dodged the attack and countered.
Lepanto was then taken out by
Abdullah
and
Jeet
. Bellamy proceeded to strike the two and easily defeated them, causing the audience to exclaim how cruel and atrocious Bellamy's actions were.
Bellamy lies defeated by Elizabello II's punch.
After defeating Abdullah and Jeet, he started attacking
Bartolomeo
. However, like Hack, whenever he tried to attack him, Bellamy ended up being the one to take the damage. He then wondered what kind of ability he was using. Despite not being able to attack him, Bellamy managed to grab and hold onto Bartolomeo while being pushed back by his barriers. His grip was so strong that he was able to spring back to his grab all the while remarking that he should not underestimate the power of a spring. At that point, however, Elizabello II was launching his legendary punch. When the king fired his "King Punch" not only did he take out Bellamy, but also every other remaining gladiator in the arena, except for the victor, Bartolomeo.
After an injured Bellamy is moved out of the ring, while having another friendly chat with Luffy, he commented on how the other has changed. Meanwhile, Bartolomeo overheard Bellamy calling him Straw Hat.
While recuperating in the Donquixote staff room, he received a letter from Doflamingo, telling him to assassinate Luffy before the end of the tournament, which would earn him a permanent spot as a family leader. The battle outside rages as Bellamy, remembering how Luffy cheered him on, seems hesitant to follow the order.
Bellamy is later seen listening in on
Cavendish
threatening Bartolomeo to not get in the way of his goal of killing Luffy.
Some time later, immediately after Luffy followed Bartolomeo's directions to find Zoro and Kin'emon outside the Colosseum, Bellamy was seen approaching Luffy from a distance, saying that he had found him, with a menacing grin on his face.
He intended to go through with the assassination for the officer position, reflecting that it was nothing personal. However, before he could reach him,
Dellinger
showed up and asked Bellamy if he was done with the assassination. In response to this, Bellamy asked Dellinger what he wanted. Dellinger then revealed Doflamingo's order to kill Bellamy, saying that Doflamingo had no confidence in him and considered him an eyesore. Bellamy reacted by angrily questioning Dellinger's previous statement.
Bartolomeo thwarting Dellinger's attempt to kill Bellamy.
Dellinger severely wounded Bellamy but before he could kill him, Bartolomeo got in the way and protected Bellamy with his barrier. Unable to complete his task, Dellinger, who had been called away by Diamante to guard the SMILE factory, angrily walked away and swore that both Bellamy and Bartolomeo would not leave Dressrosa alive. Bartolomeo then offered to take Bellamy to the medical room, but Bellamy rejected his offer, tearfully stating that he has nothing to live for and questioned Bartolomeo's reason for helping him. Bartolomeo stated that those who fought together are "friends" and he would not let a friend die without helping. As he carried Bellamy around, they ran into Luffy, who was looking for an exit. Bellamy then told Luffy to follow him but also stated that he still respected Doflamingo and would never betray him. Bellamy, Bartolomeo, and Luffy were soon approached by a
stranger
.
Bellamy is brutalized by Doflamingo.
During Doflamingo's "Birdcage" survival game, Bellamy went to the royal palace (which has been relocated to the top of the Flower Hill) and questioned Doflamingo about his betrayal.
Doflamingo responded by severely injuring Bellamy.
After Luffy and
Trafalgar Law
arrived at the palace, Doflamingo then taunted Bellamy, calling him weak and a lowly thug. He then lifted Bellamy's head up, showing the duo his brutally beaten face. As he wept, Bellamy begged them to end his life. Luffy attempted to attack Doflamingo in anger, but Doflamingo used Bellamy's face as a shield before dropping him. When Doflamingo used his string clone to attack Law, Luffy attempted to attack the real Doflamingo again. However, Doflamingo used
Parasite
to control Bellamy, making him attack Luffy. Bellamy apologized for what he was doing and begged Luffy to stop him.
After Doflamingo kicked Luffy with a Haki-enhanced kick and bound his arms with strings, Doflamingo forced Bellamy to slash him. Bellamy begged Luffy to dodge his attack. However, as Luffy was struck by him, Bellamy began to tear up again. Once both Luffy and Law were incapacitated, Bellamy listened in shock as Doflamingo explained his former status as a World Noble.
Bellamy controlled to fight Luffy alongside Doflamingo's "Black Knight".
Taking advantage of Luffy's helplessness, Doflamingo's
Black Knight
and the controlled Bellamy attacked only to be repelled by Luffy's
Gomu Gomu no Tako Stamp
. This proved to be only a brief respite as the clone managed to get behind Luffy and sent him crashing through the floor and into the palace. Dropping down alongside Doflamingo's string clone, Bellamy can only stand in silence as it proclaimed all humans to be savage creatures.
Some time later, Luffy destroyed Doflamingo's Black Knight with his Jet Gatling and broke the roof of the palace, allowing Doflamingo to see Bellamy below him. On a whim, Doflamingo decided to stop using Parasite and Bellamy was free to do whatever he wanted, leaving him to fight Luffy one last time. Despite being barely able to stand up, Bellamy refused to betray his own principles and assaulted Luffy with his new and improved Spring Hopper.
Luffy continued to implore Bellamy to stop, but Bellamy ignored his plea and struck him with a Haki-imbued punch.
Luffy defeats Bellamy with one blow again.
In spite of Luffy's pleas, Bellamy refused to back down and continued his assault. Luffy eventually realized that he could not dissuade Bellamy and decided to finish the battle, knocking out Bellamy in the same manner as he did at Jaya, except this time with a
Armament Haki
-imbued punch. With his last thought, Bellamy thanked Luffy for calling him a friend.
After Doflamingo was defeated, Bellamy was taken to Kyros' house, where he slept and recovered from his wounds.
Bellamy takes a piece of Luffy's Vivre Card before departing.
Three days after Doflamingo's downfall, the group at Kyros' house recovered from their injuries. When the Marines made a move to capture Luffy and all those affiliated with him, Bellamy stated that he was well enough to run. He then asked Law why he spared him. Law answered it was because Luffy considered him a friend. Bellamy and the others fled right when the Marines were about to storm Kyros' house.
After the escape from Dressrosa, Bellamy witnessed the launch of the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
, but refused to pledge himself as Luffy's subordinate. Nevertheless, he agreed to take a piece of Luffy's
Vivre Card
for future contingency.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Jaya Arc
[
]
Bellamy stabbing Roshio's hand in the manga.
Bellamy seizing Roshio's wrist in the anime.
The manga's introduction of Bellamy depicts him stabbing
Roshio
in the hand, shooting him in the leg, and breaking a bottle of liquor over his head (which
Sarquiss
then ignites with a match).
In the anime, this violence is toned down: the stabbing is replaced with Bellamy grabbing and crushing Roshio's wrist, the shooting is only shown striking the Wild Cherry's windows instead of Roshio's body, and the liquor and match are removed entirely.
Similarly, the anime softens his actions in Terry's pub; instead of breaking a bottle against Luffy's face, he simply punches Luffy.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Corrida Colosseum
[
]
After being knocked out the ring by
Elizabello II
's King Punch, Bellamy was seen apparently floating in the water, despite being a Devil Fruit user.
In the anime, Bellamy was seen on top of some rubble instead.
Later, he was instructed by Diamante to kill Luffy. In the manga, he was willing to kill Luffy but was interrupted by Dellinger. In the anime, he backed out at the last minute because he could not do it and then he was confronted by Dellinger.
In the anime, Dellinger's attack on Bellamy is shown and Bellamy tries to put up a fight before trying to escape and find Doflamingo for answers until his wounds get to him and allows Dellinger to attack him once more. Also in the anime, the moment where Bartolomeo steps in to save Bellamy is shown.
Dressrosa Royal Palace
[
]
In the anime, Bellamy is shown walking through the sunflower fields and making his way to the palace to confront Doflamingo about his supposed betrayal.
In the manga, the aftermath of Luffy's battle with Bellamy is shown and his defeat is announced from
Viola
's perspective, revealing he has been knocked out by a single punch again, while the events leading up to his defeat are shown in a flashback. In the anime, the events in the flashback are shown in the present happening over the course of several episodes before Bellamy is defeated.
