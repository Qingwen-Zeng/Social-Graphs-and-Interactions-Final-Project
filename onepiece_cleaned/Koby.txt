Appearance
[
]
In his first appearance, Koby was a small, timid, chubby boy with kobi pink hair and round-frame glasses.
Due to the passage of time and Garp's training, Koby has grown thinner and taller, standing close to Luffy in height. He has also gained a cross-shaped scar above his right eye, presumably earned under Garp's heavy-handed tutelage. His hair has grown longer and shaggier since his growth spurt, but it has retained its kobi pink color.
Koby wears a standard-issue Marine jacket, pants, and neckerchief as well as a brightly patterned bandanna worn tied across his forehead. Koby's glasses are still present, but he has adopted the habit of wearing them pushed up on his forehead, occasionally using them for reading.
After the timeskip, Koby has grown even taller, reaching Garp's shoulders. He now wears a scarf, a senior officer's Marine coat with the word "justice" on it, a merit on his jacket, and a new bandanna. The scar on his forehead also has grown wider.

Personality
[
]
Koby was first introduced as the
Alvida Pirates
' hapless ship caretaker who lived in fear of both the ship's crew and captain. Two years of forced servitude had robbed him of all hope of escaping as well as his dream of becoming a Marine, leaving him with few goals other than avoiding being bludgeoned to death by Alvida's iron mace. Luffy was less than impressed with Koby's cowardice, describing him as "pretty stupid and useless...and kinda wimpy too". However, Luffy's boundless optimism and single-minded pursuit of his dream rekindled a similar conviction in the downtrodden ship caretaker, allowing him to defy his captors, even under the threat of a brutal death by Alvida's mace.
As the pair continued in their travels, Koby remained timid and cautious, often relying on Luffy to perform dangerous tasks and becoming alarmed by his companion's reckless behavior.
He was also shown to be perceptive, noting that it was "strange" for the citizens of Shells Town to be afraid of a Marine Captain and telling Luffy that he had "a bad feeling about this." Koby's naïve belief in the blanket integrity of the Marines was dashed when he witnessed the actions of
Axe-Hand Morgan
and his son, but it only strengthened his resolve to become, in his words, "a
real
Marine."
Under Garp's instruction, Koby's timidity has been replaced with confidence, although he remains polite, self-effacing, and apologetic if he feels he has done something overly ambitious (such as publicly stating his goal to become a Marine admiral). He continues to be an emotional, compassionate person who can easily be driven to tears for a variety of reasons, which led to
Zoro
jocularly calling him a "crybaby" during their reunion at
Water 7
.
Koby is also completely selfless with immense compassion, being devoted to helping people both civilians and his fellow Marines unconditionally which earned him immense popularity.
Koby does not act with the reckless bravery that many characters in the series exhibit, but rather on moral compunction. He has put his life on the line at least twice for the sake of what he feels is right, most notably at the Summit War of Marineford where he brought fighting to a standstill by facing down Admiral
Akainu
and bought the precious seconds needed for Luffy to escape.
Koby has an immense amount of determination. In the early days of his training as a Marine when he was still weak, he would train relentlessly non-stop by punching battleships which could only be done by powerful Marines such as Garp and
Kuzan
due to acknowledging his lack of fighting talent. Despite his already exhaustive training session with Garp, he continued to train on a daily basis despite his hands would keep bleeding from the injuries.
For all he has done and is capable of doing, Koby is rather humble, as he denied
Kyros
' claim of him being a hero during the
Rocky Port Incident
and did not claim credit for stopping a torpedo that was aiming at the
Dressrosa
and
Prodence Kingdom
ships.
He felt ashamed for thinking
Marines
had come to rescue him and considered it thinking that the world revolved around him when trying to escape from
Hachinosu
and was shocked when he discovered they had come for him.
Relationships
[
]
Marines
[
]
Koby is deeply well liked by numerous Marines including Garp, Tashigi and Hibari. When he was captured by Blackbeard Pirates, many Marines including fellow SWORD members joined Garp in a suicidal mission to save Koby alone.
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
Garp
is the mentor/instructor of Koby and Helmeppo; he keeps them out of trouble and ensures that they are not slacking off. If they do get out of hand, he knocks them around to ensure they know their place. Koby admires Garp, even though he maintains a highly brutal clutch on him because he would not be where he is without him. Garp was horrified when Koby shouted out to stop the massacre at Marineford during the Whitebeard War.
After Koby was captured by Blackbeard, Garp went to
Hachinosu
to rescue his apprentice much to his shock and surprised that Garp and the rest came just to rescue him. Garp acknowledged Koby's potential and determination as he entrusted Koby to stop Pizzaro's devastating attack on the Marine Ship.
Helmeppo
[
]
Koby and Helmeppo working together.
After his father's termination from the Marines,
Helmeppo
lost access to the luxurious life that he once held under his father's rank. He was forced to become a chore boy alongside Koby, and despite Koby's good-natured attempts to befriend him, he refused any of it. After being kidnapped by his own father and held hostage, Helmeppo disowned his father and started changing, becoming braver and less of a spoiled brat. Eventually, Koby and Helmeppo become close friends. Now they are working together. In addition, Helmeppo also deeply care for Koby, and he rushed to help him after being defeated by Luffy.
After Koby had been captured by the Blackbeard Pirates, Helmeppo wanted to go save his friend as soon as possible, pleading with his superiors to do so.
Sakazuki
[
]
Koby seems to have a great fear of
Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
. He and Helmeppo were terrified when they witnessed him executing a fellow marine simply for abandoning his post. Also, after Koby’s speech about the lives of their comrades, Sakazuki was unmoved in the slightest and tried to kill him, only to be stopped by Shanks. This incident did not affect Koby's standing in the Marines, since he was promoted to the rank of Captain after Akainu's promotion to Fleet Admiral.
X Drake
[
]
Koby and
X Drake
seem to know each other due to their familiarity during their conversation by
Den Den Mushi
. They appear to have a trusted professional relationship due to Koby being one of the few people who is aware that Drake's return to piracy was a ruse, and he is still affiliated with the Marines as a commanding officer of the
SWORD
unit.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Luffy and Koby talking whilst on Water 7.
Koby was one of the first people Luffy met on his journey. He traveled briefly with Luffy, acting as a temporary navigator after Luffy had helped him escape from his servitude to Alvida. He later joined the Marines following the incident with Captain Morgan. The two also encountered each other at Water 7. Although they are now on opposite sides and will inevitably have to fight, Koby and Luffy still consider each other friends, since Luffy helped Koby muster up the courage to become a Marine.
They were both happy to see each other again at Water 7 though he was surprised to learn of
Luffy's father
. However, during the Battle at Marineford, Koby chose to fight Luffy only to be swiftly defeated by a punch to the face. Despite that, this has not damaged their friendship, as Koby still admires Luffy's strength. Koby would frequently speak praises of Luffy in front of the other Marines such as X Drake despite his status as an infamous pirate.
After learning of the potentially world-ending ramifications of someone finding the One Piece, Koby decided that he couldn't allow Luffy to accomplish his dream.
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
Koby also met Zoro while he was imprisoned in Captain Morgan's Marine base. At first, Koby was afraid of Zoro's bad reputation. However, after finding out Zoro had a kind personality, Koby started to admire him. Both of them were glad to see each other again at Water 7. However, Zoro acknowledged that Koby was better friends with Luffy than with himself.
Enemies
[
]
Alvida Pirates
[
]
Koby confronts Alvida.
Koby was forced to serve as a chore boy under Alvida and her crew for two years after he had accidentally boarded their ship. Because of his cowardice, he would do whatever he was ordered to do without question. He was often mocked by the pirates in Alvida's crew. Alvida would often ask Koby who was the most beautiful woman in the world and, if he did not reply that she was, he would be punished. When Luffy showed up, he explained to Koby that he was willing to die for his dream. After Koby had realized that he should also be willing to die for his dream, he found the courage to openly defy Alvida and express his true feelings towards her. This angered Alvida, and she was about to kill Koby, but Luffy stepped in and quickly defeated her.
Boa Hancock
[
]
After the dissolution of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, Koby was sent to capture
Boa Hancock
, who herself was preparing to fight back. He offered Hancock a peace solution which is to surrender herself and come with the Marines just so the
World Government
will spare her people, only for her to angrily refuse and turn most of the Marines into stone, save for Koby. He seems currently unaware, however, of her affiliation with Luffy.
Marshall D. Teach
[
]
At some point during the timeskip, Koby temporarily joined forces with
Blackbeard
and
Trafalgar Law
against pirates from
Hachinosu
. This event became well-known as the
Rocky Port Incident
where Koby prioritized the safety of civilians amidst all the fighting. According to Blackbeard, Koby helped him oust
Ochoku
and take over the island during the incident,
but the specific details of the battle are still unknown. As this was an alliance of convenience, Koby returned to being a enemy of both pirate captains after the battle was over.
Koby was captured by Blackbeard and his
crew
after the invasion of
Amazon Lily
.
When Blackbeard held 800 Marine soldiers hostage against him, Koby surrendered and turned himself to Teach in exchange to release the Marine hostages. Seeing value in the Marine captain, Blackbeard intended to use Koby to negotiate with the Government to legalize Hachinosu as a country for criminals, which Koby contemptuously rebuffed.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Initially, Koby was an ordinary boy without any real physical prowess or fighting skills (according to
Alvida
, his only asset was a measure of
navigational
knowledge).
He gained some fighting skills after he trained under
Vice Admiral
Monkey D. Garp
, alongside
Helmeppo
, learning the
Rokushiki
, surprising Luffy and Zoro from the amount of growth he'd undergone. After the two-year timeskip, Koby reached the rank of
Captain
, granting him command over lower-ranked Marines and charge of his own ship. In addition to this, at some point he became a member of the covert Marine squadron
SWORD
, who are granted enough free reign to take on missions normal Marines could not, including challenging any of the
Four Emperors
.
At some point, he became regarded as a "Hero" because of the
Rocky Port Incident
, somehow assisting the
Emperor
,
Blackbeard
in defeating
Ochoku
, a former member of the
Rocks Pirates
and a famous pirate comparable to
Shiki
and
Captain John
.
During the Marines' invasion of
Amazon Lily
to arrest the former
Warlord
,
Boa Hancock
, Koby was one of the few people to not get petrified by
her powers
: a notable feat as
Yamakaji
,
Catarina Devon
,
Vasco Shot
, a
Vice Admiral
and two of the
Blackbeard Pirates
' Titanic Captains were among the Marines and pirates to be petrified. After the
Cross Guild
placed bounties on Marines, his was
500,000,000, most notable as most Marine Captains are worth
100,000,000.
He also has some knowledge of swordsmanship, as he was seen practicing with Helmeppo and Bogard.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Koby uses "Honesty Impact" to destroy Pizarro's island hand.
Due to his harsh training regimen under Garp as well as further gruesome training in his spare time, Koby has developed superhuman physical prowess and attributes, such as strength and speed, capable of pulling off one of the
Rokushiki
techniques,
Soru
, momentarily surprising and kicking Luffy before he could react, as well as avoiding his punch. As with his mentor and Kuzan, to make up for his lack of talent when he was still weak, he would often use retired
battleships
as punching bags, often doing so every night after finishing training with Garp despite suffering the intense pain and continously bleeding his hands, all while not using Haki to build up punching power; where at some point, like those powerful Marines, he'd become capable of caving in the armored hulls. After the two-year timeskip and mastering Rokushiki, Koby displays more impressive physical prowess for a Marine Captain, showing himself to be an excellent swimmer, catching up, then redirecting a torpedo barehanded within seconds.
Most notably, he has proved himself to be strong and durable enough to be the last Marine standing up against the former Warlord,
Boa Hancock
, and the Emperor,
Marshall D. Teach
, having also been involved in somehow aiding the Emperor defeat former
Rocks Pirate
Ochoku
.
While on
Hachinosu
, despite still being chained to an iron ball and still recovering from the previous battle on
Amazon Lily
, Koby could free the captured people and escape from numerous pirates attacking him. A testament to his developing punching power, a Haki-enhanced punch was powerful enough to break apart
Avalo Pizarro
's island hand, a feat almost comparable to that of his mentor.
In
Episode of Luffy
, he shattered a gigantic metal disk with a single punch and performed Rokushiki techniques with great ease.
Techniques
[
]
Honesty Impact
(
実直拳骨
,
Onesuti Inpakuto
?
, literally meaning "Honest Fist")
: Koby imbues his fist with
Armament Haki
before delivering a massively powerful punch with shockwaves that project forward. This was first seen being used to destroy
Avalo Pizarro
's
island hand
.
Rokushiki
[
]
Main article:
Rokushiki
Since his training with Garp, Koby has become strong enough to use at least one of the
Rokushiki
, the
Soru
technique. He has used Soru against Luffy twice: once at Water 7 and once at the Summit War of Marineford, although the technique did not help him win either fight.
After the timeskip, Koby has mastered his Rokushiki techniques.
In
One Piece: Gigant Battle! 2 New World
he is also capable of using the
Geppo
and
Rankyaku
techniques.
In
Episode of Luffy
, he shows to be able to use a technique similar to
Rankyaku
, but this was done with his arms.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Armament Haki
[
]
Koby is an extremely skilled
Armament Haki
user.
At
Hachinosu
, an almost exhausted Koby hardened his fist to break apart
Avalo Pizarro
's gigantic hand, preparing to crush their escaping battleship, which carried civilians and comrades. Furthermore, he proved skilled and powerful in the advanced application of emitting Haki without a medium, resulting in him blasting apart the Ten Titanic Captains'
gigantic island hand
, which was roughly the size of a mountain. Such a feat of Armament Haki sparked immediate astonishment from the
Marines
,
SWORD
members, and
Blackbeard Pirates
, some of which included Devil Fruit users and combatants who fought powerful opponents.
Observation Haki
[
]
During the Summit War of Marineford, Koby awakened
Observation Haki
. Koby was shown hunched over and crying intensely on the battlefield, saying that the voices in his head were disappearing one by one as the combatants around him were slain, much like what
Aisa
felt during the
Skypiea Arc
.
After the timeskip, Koby had developed his Observation Haki to a very advanced level.
He was able to notice a torpedo headed towards the
Dressrosa
-
Prodence Kingdom
ship underwater from his own ship a ways off, shocking Helmeppo, who did not notice it despite his own Observation Haki. On top of that, Koby also managed to sense
Kyros
's great strength despite just meeting him.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Koby getting on the wrong boat.
Koby was born eighteen years ago in the
East Blue
.
At age fourteen, while on a fishing trip, he accidentally boarded a ship with the
Alvida Pirates
. Defenseless and terrified, Koby effectively became a
slave
to the pirates (who kept him alive mainly for his
navigational knowledge
) on their
island hideout
. Here, he endured constant menial labor and beatings, particularly from
Alvida
herself, who often used her mace to force him into flattering her beauty and power. Over time he grew resentful of all pirates, developing dreams of escaping and becoming a
Marine
, and so began building an escape boat in secret.
East Blue Saga
[

Romance Dawn Arc
[

Koby and his crewmates find Luffy inside a barrel.
Two years into his plight, after a seemingly routine day cleaning
Alvida's ship
and enduring the pirates' abuse, Koby retrieved a barrel that had washed ashore, unaware it actually contained
Monkey D. Luffy
(who had hidden inside to survive a whirlpool). Thinking the barrel held alcohol, senior pirates
Heppoko
,
Peppoko
and
Poppoko
seized it, only for Luffy to burst out. In the ensuing confusion, Luffy was knocked into the nearby woods, where Koby followed; after introductions, Luffy asked for a boat, and Koby presented his self-made escape boat, admitting he no longer had the courage to use it himself.
Unimpressed, Luffy declared his dream to become Pirate King or die trying. Moved by Luffy's resolve, Koby began voicing his own dream, only faltering when Alvida emerged and destroyed the boat. Thinking Luffy a
bounty hunter
hired to capture her, Alvida demanded Koby reaffirm his loyalty, only for Luffy to casually defy her and her vanity. Following Luffy's example, Koby swallowed his fears and joined in the insults. He stood firm as the enraged Alvida prepared to kill him, but Luffy blocked Alvida's mace with his
rubber body
and defeated her with a single punch. Luffy then exacted a new boat from Alvida's men, taking Koby on as his first traveling companion.
Koby and Luffy arrive at Shells Town's Marine base.
As they set off to sea, Koby was concerned about what Luffy's fate in the
Grand Line
would be, and Luffy said he would recruit a strong crew starting with the
bounty hunter
Roronoa Zoro
.
With Koby navigating, the pair reached
Shells Town
, where Zoro had been imprisoned by the
Marines
'
153rd Branch
. Though Koby was initially terrified by Zoro's reputation, they soon realized the town was actually under threat from the tyrannical
Captain
Morgan
and his son
Helmeppo
, who had unjustly imprisoned Zoro for defying them to save a girl named
Rika
.
Helmeppo then came into the village, mentioning to Luffy how he planned to execute Zoro in three days despite giving Zoro a chance at freedom, and Koby watched as Luffy punched him for dishonestly imprisoning Zoro.
Koby held Luffy back from attacking Helmeppo further, and grew worried as Helmeppo went away and promised revenge. Luffy went to go recruit Zoro, and a little while later, Koby went to free Zoro because he wanted to uphold real justice as a Marine. He was shot in the shoulder by a Marine,
but decided to stay and continue freeing Zoro. Koby revealed Helmeppo's deception to Zoro and said that Luffy had attacked Helmeppo because of this. Suddenly, the two of them were surrounded by Marines.
Helmeppo threatening to shoot Koby.
The Marines shot at Koby and Zoro, but they were suddenly shielded by Luffy, whose
rubber body
shot the bullets back, and Koby fainted after seeing this.
He came to soon afterward, only to see the Marines charging at them with swords. However, Luffy freed Zoro and the two pirates took out the Marines. As Luffy fought Morgan, Koby called for him to defeat the Marines, and was shocked as Morgan sliced an entire fence in two with his axe hand. Koby watched as Luffy overwhelmed Morgan, but he was held at gunpoint by Helmeppo in an attempt to stop Luffy. Koby said he was not afraid of death and watched as Luffy punched Helmeppo while Zoro struck Morgan down.
To Koby's surprise, the Marines then celebrated their captain's defeat.
Luffy punches Koby.
Koby, Luffy, and Zoro then went to Rika's mother's restaurant, and Koby reflected that Luffy and Zoro were the first friends he made. The Marines then came in and asked Luffy and Zoro to leave the island since they were pirates, and they asked if Koby was with them. Koby denied it, but Luffy started telling the Marines about his past with Alvida. This caused Koby to punch Luffy and the two to get into a fight, but as they were broken up, Koby knew that Luffy did that to distance the two of them and allow him to join the Marines. He then asked to join the Marines, and although they were aware of his past, they agreed to his request. As Luffy and Zoro prepared to sail away, Koby came and saluted them in thanks, and to his surprise he was joined by the rest of the Marines as they thanked Luffy and Zoro for their actions.
Diary of Koby-Meppo
[
]
Koby and Helmeppo training hard to become great Marines.
After joining the Marines, Koby and Helmeppo started out as Marine
chore boys
at the
153rd Branch
in
Shells Town
.
The two were later tasked with chore duty on a ship transferring the prisoner Morgan. As
Vice Admiral
Monkey D. Garp
was taking Morgan into his custody, Morgan caught Garp off-guard and slashed him before taking Helmeppo hostage.
Morgan fled on a small boat with his hostage and the Marines prepared to fire on the small vessel. However, Koby, not willing to let them kill his friend, scared them away with a gun.
Bogard
sliced Koby's guns into pieces, but Garp stepped in before the two could continue fighting. Though Morgan escaped,
the bravery shown by the two earned them the attention of Garp, who took the two under his wing as pupils.
Koby and Helmeppo accompanied the vice admiral to Marineford to train under him.
Despite the harsh training under Garp, Koby continued to force himself to train even harder in his spare time by punching retired battleships non-stop due to acknowledging his complete lack of talent in fighting. He would persist in this brutal training method despite the intense pain and bleeding.

Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[

Koby and Helmeppo are easily defeated by Luffy and Zoro.
Koby went to
Water 7
alongside Helmeppo when Garp paid Luffy a visit. On the vice admiral's order, Helmeppo charged at Zoro while Koby attacked Luffy. Both he and Helmeppo were easily beaten after a brief skirmish. Koby cheerfully admitted defeat and reintroduced himself to Luffy and Zoro, asking if they remembered him. Although the
Straw Hat captain
initially had trouble recognizing Koby due to his growth spurt, the trio were happily reunited. Koby, like the Straw Hat crew and the rest of Garp's men, was shocked when the vice admiral revealed that the revolutionary
Dragon
is his son and Luffy's father.
After some time, Zoro went back inside with the other Straw Hats, leaving Luffy, Koby, and Helmeppo to sit outside and reminisce about their first meeting and the young Marine's journey to the Grand Line. Luffy insisted that the two Marines come in and share a meal with his crew, but Koby declined the invitation, saying that he and Luffy were members of opposing factions and that they should not be too friendly with one another. Before he left, Koby asked Luffy what he knew about the latter half of the Grand Line, which Marines and pirates call "the
New World
." He requested to meet the Straw Hat captain again in that sea, promising to be strong enough to fight and capture him.
Koby reveals to Luffy his dream of becoming an admiral.
He became so worked up that he accidentally blurted out his dream of becoming an
admiral
before immediately collapsing in embarrassment. Luffy accepted Koby's ambitious proclamation as a certainty, saying that if the Marine wanted to fight with him in the New World, then he could not be anything other than an admiral. Koby was moved to tears by Luffy's unshakable faith in him and was teased by Zoro for still being a crybaby. Koby and Helmeppo departed, repeating their challenge to the Straw Hats to meet again in the New World.
Koby saw Luffy one more time as he left Water 7 when Garp attacked. He was afraid the vice admiral would sink the
Thousand Sunny
and its crew but was relieved when the Straw Hats managed to escape.

Koby and Helmeppo at Marineford.
Koby and Helmeppo reported to
Marineford
to participate in the
war
against the
Whitebeard Pirates
, and they were present for
Sengoku
's speech about
Portgas D. Ace
's past. After hearing that Ace was
Gol D. Roger
's son, the two came to a conclusion that Ace and Luffy were not biological brothers.
Frightened by the display of power from both sides and the ensuing bloodshed as the Marines and
Whitebeard
's forces clash, Koby and Helmeppo ran away. By chance, they crossed paths with
Akainu
and, from their hiding place behind a wall, witnessed the admiral brutally punishing another Marine for deserting. They later overheard Sengoku's communication with Akainu through the admiral's
Den Den Mushi
, which revealed the
fleet admiral
's plan to ignore the schedule and execute Ace right away. It was then that they noticed Luffy's ship falling from the sky.
Upon seeing Luffy, Koby was utterly surprised. When Sengoku announced that Luffy is Dragon's son, Koby was shocked that the Fleet Admiral decided to reveal such information.
Luffy defeats Koby with just one blow.
When Luffy was charging to the execution stand to rescue Ace, Koby blocked his path, determined to fight him. He told himself that, if he cowered away from the situation, he would not be able to improve. His resolve, however, was not enough as Koby was no match for Luffy and was defeated with a single punch. Luffy moved on, leaving Koby unconscious in the middle of the battlefield.
Eventually, Koby woke up, distressed that the war was still raging despite the fact that Ace had been killed by Akainu. The trauma of the battle triggered his own
Haki
, allowing him to involuntarily
sense every human presence
nearby on the battlefield (described by Koby as voices inside his head). He was reduced to tears as he listened to the voices of the combatants disappearing one by one as they were killed. As the violence rose to a fever pitch, Koby screamed at the top of his lungs, begging both sides to stop throwing lives away for a war that no longer had any purpose.
Koby is saved from Akainu by Shanks.
The young Marine's cry caused a moment's pause in the battle and inadvertently saved Luffy's life.
Kizaru
, who was seconds away from destroying
Trafalgar Law
's
submarine
, stopped to look at Koby, which gave the
Heart Pirates
the time needed to submerge and flee from the battlefield with Luffy on board. Akainu, unimpressed, prepared to kill Koby for wasting "precious seconds" of the battle. The young Marine fearfully steeled himself for death, reassuring himself that he said what he had to say and that he had no regrets.
His life was saved by the sudden arrival of
Shanks
, who commended the young Marine for his actions, explaining that his few seconds of courage had drastically changed the future of the world. Koby immediately fell unconscious after his timely rescue from an otherwise certain demise.
Post-War Arc

Koby awakens in Marineford's infirmary.
At Marine Headquarters healing center, Koby rested with other injured soldiers and Helmeppo at his bedside. He was still clearly traumatized by the events, saying that he had felt human presences too strongly and that he could not calm down. Doctor
Fishbonen
told him that what he was feeling was Haki and that all Marines ranked vice admiral and above have Haki. The doctor suggested that Garp should be able to help Koby. Helmeppo was envious that Koby seemed to have advanced in skill, though Koby claimed to not have known about the ability in the first place.

Koby talks with Drake.
After the abolishment of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
system, Koby headed for
Amazon Lily
to capture
Boa Hancock
. On the way, he contacted
X Drake
via
Den Den Mushi
and was informed of

and

's newly formed alliance and
CP0
's arrival in
Wano Country
.
Koby negotiates with Hancock and Blackbeard.
Employing the new
Seraphim
, the Marines fought their way into Amazon Lily. When the
Blackbeard Pirates
invaded, Koby requested that Hancock hand herself into Marine custody, but the Empress refused and attacked the invaders,
petrifying
most of the Marines and pirates. Koby ordered
S-Hawk
to stop attacking because it risked damaging the Marines. Before Hancock could attack the distracted Koby, Teach grabbed Hancock and held her by the throat,
nullifying
her power. When she revealed that killing her would make the petrification permanent, Koby tried to negotiate Hancock's release so she could free everyone but Teach refused to trust Hancock. Before Teach could kill her though,
Silvers Rayleigh
arrived, much to Koby's shock and awe, and acted as mediator for the situation. Hancock was freed and restored the petrified people.
In the aftermath of the battle, when the Blackbeard Pirates attempted to abduct 800 Marine soldiers and one battleship, Koby offered up his life instead, leading to them taking him in the soldiers' place.

Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
A captive Koby listening to Blackbeard's plan.
Upon being taken to
Hachinosu
, Teach informs Koby that he plans to use the Marine's life as ransom for turning Hachinosu into a World Government-affiliated nation. Koby was disgusted by the idea of a country of criminals and pointed out that Marines would not give in since he was a member of SWORD. After listening to
Kuzan
's explanation of the organization, Teach still intended to continue with his plan, doubting that the World Government would give up on such a popular Marine as Koby, so Koby was imprisoned on Hachinosu.
Koby joins the fight against the Blackbeard Pirates.
A few weeks after the assault on Amazon Lily,
Perona
brought the keys to Koby in exchange for him freeing
Gecko Moria
, who had also imprisoned on the island. Koby agreed and, after freeing other prisoners as well, led an escape across the island. Once
Avalo Pizarro
noticed the breakout and alerted the island, Koby acted as a decoy in order to distract the pirates from pursuing the other escapees. Shortly after, SWORD began attacking the island and pirates. When Koby ended up encircled by pirates,
Hibari
used Flower Rounds to turn all their ammunition into GP Flowers, saving Koby. He was then shocked to see a battleship launched into the air toward the island, and stared in disbelief that Garp was among the Marines who had come to save him.
Relieved to see Garp, Koby rushed to the battleship alongside Hibari and was surprised to see so many Marines coming to save him, including non-SWORD members like
Tashigi
. However, his joy was then disrupted when he saw Hibari being frozen by Kuzan, who stated he could not let Koby escape. Koby begged Kuzan to unfreeze Hibari, but Kuzan ignored him while fighting Garp.
After all of the prisoners are rescued and everyone except himself, Helmeppo,
Prince Grus
, and Garp board Garp's ship, Koby prepared to retreat only to be distracted by a woman calling for help. He rushed to her aid, only to discover that she had lured him into a trap. All of a sudden, he was pushed to the ground by Garp, who ended up getting stabbed by
Shiryu
. Koby apologized for needing to be saved by Garp, but the latter explained that he was Shiryu's real target. After Garp himself got knocked down, Koby saw Pizarro threaten to crush everyone on Garp's ship with a
giant hand made from the island
, but Garp calmed him down and confidently told him that he could stop Pizarro.
Sure enough, Koby did so by using his phenomenal strength to destroy Pizarro's hand while at the same time board the ship along with Grus and Helmeppo. However, when he learned that Garp them to abandon him and save themselves, Koby immediately told to Grus to turn back for him, but was ultimately forced to leave with the rest of his crew.
Koby recovers alongside his friends.
Sometime later, Koby's group made their way to the
Marine GS General Hospital
. While recovering from their injuries, they listened to Vegapunk's broadcast. Koby was frustrated with how he could not keep up with everything being revealed, and spoke with Grus about the troubling conclusion to which the message was leading. When Vegapunk's broadcast began talking about those that bear the
D. Moniker
, Koby thought of Garp and Luffy.
With the broadcast nearing its end, Koby listened intently as Vegapunk stated that the fate of the world will be decided by whoever is able to claim the One Piece.
After the broadcast ended, Koby realized the potential ramifications the world would face if Luffy succeeded in finding the One Piece. He then declared that he would have to step up and stop Luffy from achieving his dream.

Anime Differences
[
]
Romance Dawn Arc
[
]
The anime rewrites the initial meeting between Luffy and Koby (and the rest of the Alvida Pirates) to be more dynamic, with Alvida forcing Koby to participate in a raid on a
civilian ship
, where he discovers Luffy's barrel; the Alvida Pirates'
base island
is completely omitted, and with it the escape boat that Koby built during his captivity.
In addition, the anime does not have Koby being shot when he tries to free Zoro
(though it is included in the
Episode of East Blue
retelling).
Finally, the anime has Koby explain the
world
's basic geography—information the manga originally delivered through
Nami
, on the
Island of Rare Animals
—to Luffy, Zoro, and Rika shortly before the Straw Hats leave Shells Town.
Diary of Koby-Meppo
[
]
Due to the compressed storytelling of the original
cover arc
, the anime creates several new scenes for Koby, such as a brawl with Helmeppo that accidentally sets off a cannon and destroys part of the 153rd Branch. Notable changes are also made to his actions during
Morgan
's abduction of Helmeppo: instead of using pistols to stall
Bogard
's cannoneers, he convinces them to hold fire with a promise of capturing Morgan himself, and swims out to Morgan's escape boat alone. This inspires Helmeppo to similar defiance, and though Morgan easily overpowers both boys, he leaves them alive, claiming they are not worth killing.
Several more expansions are made for the pair's tutelage under Vice Admiral Garp, including a newspaper article stating they had taken the standard
Reverse Mountain
route into the
Grand Line
(a conflict with later revelations in the
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
that
Marine Headquarters
ships
can effortlessly cross the
Calm Belt
).
More significantly, their physical training is punctuated by an incident where Garp goads them into a direct fight, under guise of punishing them for their "relations" with Luffy.
Live-Action Differences
[
]
In the
live-action series
, Koby's role expands during the events in the
East Blue
, being a central character in the subplot of said events, which focus on his relationship with
Garp
, and his doubts regarding the actions of the Marines and the World Government.
As in the anime, Koby's encounter with Luffy on Goat Island is replaced by an encounter at sea, while aboard the
Miss Love Duck
.
Contrary to the original story, Koby does not go directly with Luffy to the base of the
153rd Branch
, and at no point does he go there while Luffy is in Shells Town. Upon arriving in the town, Koby and Luffy see several reward posters on the street, and later visit the bar where they witness Zoro's meeting with Helmeppo. He and Luffy also spend the night on the ship that docked in the port, where they talk about what to do. Later, when Luffy leaves the town, Koby hits Helmeppo, who intended to attack Luffy.
Later, Garp visits the 153rd Branch, where he meets Koby, whom he questions about his relationship with Luffy because people saw them together at the bar.
Koby has a significant role during the events in the
Syrup Village
, where after encountering
Usopp
, who was trying to warn about a pirate attack, he accompanies him along with Helmeppo and other Marines to
Kaya
's mansion, where
Kuro
denies Usopp's accusations, and gives them Luffy, who was unconscious. Later, Zoro manages to rescue Luffy from the Marines, to which Koby later apologizes to Garp for not having captured him, but Garp tells him that at least they have gotten them off the island.
Koby overhears Garp's conversation with
Dracule Mihawk
, and upon asking Helmeppo about the latter, his companion explains that Mihawk is part of a
group of pirates
that works for the government, which surprises Koby because they have criminals on their side.
Later, they visit the
Baratie
, where Koby and Helmeppo acquire information relating to Luffy's whereabouts from one of the employees.
In the
Cocoyasi Village
, Koby gives Luffy his first reward poster, telling him that it was Captain
Nezumi
. After that, they both say goodbye to each other.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Main article:
Name Variants
Many early fan translations—as well as
Funimation
—romanized his name
Coby
, while
4Kids
and
VIZ
generally favored
Koby
. The latter was eventually confirmed
canon
by his personal sail design in the
Levely Arc
.
The 4Kids anime removes Luffy hitting him during their first meeting, rewriting the scene to state that he expected a blow and flinched accordingly (though the general overtones of the Alvida Pirates' abuse are unchanged). His being held at gunpoint by
Helmeppo
is also edited to replace the pistol with a bizarre hammer-like device.
