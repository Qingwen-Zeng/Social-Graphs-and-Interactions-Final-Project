Past
[

Over 13 years ago, Époni was responsible for caring for the
Germa Kingdom
's gravely ill
queen
, after
Sora
self-administered a drug to counteract the effects of the
Lineage Factor
surgery she was forced to undergo.
While Sora remained bedridden during her final years, Époni continued dutifully as her nurse.
Prior to her death, the queen occasionally received visits from her daughter,
Reiju
, as well as her third son,
Sanji
. Époni would usually be close at hand during these visits.
On one such visit by Sanji, he showed Époni the
food
he had prepared for Sora. Although Époni stated that his mother had difficulty keeping anything down, Époni tried the food just in case, but the food tasted terrible. Époni replaced Sanji's food with another meal, but Sora told Époni that she would eat the food Sanji prepared. Époni explained that she already discarded it, but the queen nonetheless demanded it back and ate it. Sora described the food as delicious, shocking Époni but delighting Sanji.
Sometime later during one of Reiju's visits in which Sora told her daughter about Sanji's meal, Époni was present and awkwardly witnessed Sora's emotional reaction to Sanji's kindness.
