Sanjuan Wolf
is an enormous
giant

"Colossal Battleship"

Impel Down
, as his crimes were so atrocious they had to effectively be erased from history itself. He was initially mentioned briefly by
Emporio Ivankov
.

Marshall D. Teach
, and since then has become a member of the
Blackbeard Pirates
. He is currently one of the
Ten Titanic Captains
, as the captain of the Seventh Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist in the
Marineford Arc
, a minor antagonist in the
Egghead Arc
, and a major antagonist in the
Final Saga
.
Appearance
[
]
Thanks at least in part to his
Devil Fruit
, Wolf is a
giant
of extraordinary size, as high at 180m at least,
towering over even the largest beings known to date like
Oars
or
Little Oars Jr.
, as well as being so big that he appears to be roughly the same size as the Marine Headquarters at
Marineford
. His true size, however, is still unknown. The shape of his head and the disposition of his brown beard resemble a chestnut, making his spiky, round and beige hair resemble a chestnut shell. His facial features include round eyes with dark lines around them, along with eyelash-like marks, similar to those found on
Franky
's face, that point downward. He wears his prison uniform from Impel Down and he is always barefoot.
His body is broad and kind of on the chubby side with arms that are long, lean yet muscular and hairy, while his legs are thin and stubby compared to the rest of his body.
After the timeskip, Wolf now wears clothing of a similar style to the Giants of
Elbaph
, lacking an upper body garment but wearing dark pants with a large, studded belt with a skull buckle, as well as a dark cape fastened over his right pectoral with a light medallion.
Following the raid on the island by the
Marines
, he appears to have discarded the cape.
Personality
[
]
Although known for committing crimes that caused his existence to be erased from history,
he seems to have a playful attitude, as seen when commenting that he was found when he was trying to hide behind
Marine Headquarters
.
He is also quite shy, as he acts scared when people realize who he is and continued hiding while the rest of the crew fought
Whitebeard
. In fact, he was the only person there who did not fight in the war. He is also prone to complaining, as shown when the Blackbeard Pirates headed to the
New World
. Despite his complaining and lack of participation, he is shown to be very loyal to Blackbeard. He is shown to be a heavy sleeper as he napped in the daytime during a prison break in
Hachinosu
.
Relationships

Blackbeard Pirates

Wolf and his crewmates enjoying themselves.
After the
Blackbeard Pirates
sprung him from
Impel Down
, Wolf has been a devoted member and a major powerhouse of the crew ever since. He has been seen eating, drinking and generally having a good time with the crew. The
Admiral
of the Blackbeard Pirates
Marshall D. Teach
does not care for Wolf's bellyaching as seen when the crew was waiting for a new ship after their raft nearly broke in two. His fellow Titanic Captains
Avalo Pizarro
and
Vasco Shot
are hesitant to send Wolf to deal with certain problems fully aware of the destruction the world's largest
giant
is capable of.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Wolf's abilities have not yet been shown, but he was powerful enough to be contained in Level 6 of Impel Down when caught by the
World Government
, where even
Emporio Ivankov
pointed him out as one of the most dangerous prisoners.
Another testament to his power is the fact that when Blackbeard recruited the Level 6 prisoners, he was one of the people that survived the battle royale, making him one of the strongest prisoners.
After the timeskip, has since become one of Blackbeard's "Ten Titanic Captains" that personally guard the
Emperor
,
gaining great authority over their Seventh Ship and everyone on it.
As a
giant
, Wolf ages a lot slower than a human and has immense strength, though he was still defeated by Marine veteran
Monkey D. Garp
rather quickly. However, this could be because he was asleep at the time and was caught off guard.
Despite his tremendous size, he is considerably stealthy, able to somehow reach Marineford without being detected until he was right behind the Marine Headquarters building and made himself known.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Deka Deka no Mi
Wolf half the size of a town.
Wolf ate the Deka Deka no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that makes him much bigger than normal giants.
Despite being weak against water, he was tall enough to stand in the ocean, though Wolf did mention that doing so was exhausting to him,
probably due to the Devil Fruit he had eaten.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Sanjuan Wolf was born ninety-nine years ago in the
West Blue
. At some time, he ate the
Deka Deka no Mi
which gave him the size he is known for.
He became one of the most feared criminals in the world, and is noted to be the only known giant of his size, but was eventually caught by the
World Government
and sentenced to life in
Impel Down
, Level 6, where he was effectively erased from history.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Impel Down Arc
[
]
When
Blackbeard
and
his crew
came to Impel Down, they forced the Level 6 prisoners to fight to the death within their cells. Wolf emerged victorious from his, so he was liberated and joined the pirates.
Marineford Arc
[
]

The Blackbeard Pirates arrived to the
Summit War of Marineford
. Wolf hid behind the
Marine Headquarters
, and was amused when the Marines spotted
and recognized him.
Wolf did not participate in his crew's murdering of
Whitebeard
, and departed with them after
Shanks
arrived to end the war.
Post-War Arc
[
]
The Blackbeard Pirates went on to the
New World
, but thanks at least in part to Wolf, their log raft was damaged. They defeated
Jewelry Bonney
and her crew on a burning island, intending to trade Bonney to the Marines for a Marine battleship.

While they were waiting for the Marines to show up, Wolf stood in the ocean near the coast and complained about the heat, losing strength and being bitten by a fish, but Blackbeard told him to stop complaining. The Blackbeard Pirates then had to flee the island after spotting Admiral
Akainu
on the oncoming Marine battleship, knowing he would not make the deal with them and fighting him would be too much trouble.
During the Timeskip
[
]
One year after the war at Marineford, the Blackbeard Pirates
fought against
the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates and ultimately won. This victory combined with the fact that Teach had conquered most of Whitebeard's former territory, made the World Government officerly declared the Blackbeard Pirates an
Emperor's
crew.
At some point, the Blackbeard Pirates expanded, and Wolf became one of the Ten Titanic Captains, leading the seventh ship of the fleet.
Wolf and his crewmates frozen by Kuzan.
The Blackbeard Pirates used Teach's knowledge of Whitebeard's former territory to conquer most of it. With Blackbeard now an Emperor, the crew began hunting powerful
Devil Fruit
users so they could kill and steal their abilities. After a chance encounter with
Kuzan
, Wolf and several other Blackbeard Pirates were
frozen
by the former Marine
Admiral
. After Wolf and the others were thawed out, they all drank and laughed before Blackbeard managed to recruit Kuzan into the crew.
Thanks to the interference of Marine Captain
Koby
during the
Rocky Port Incident
caused by
Trafalgar Law
, Teach defeated
Ochoku
and the Blackbeard Pirates managed to make the island
Hachinosu
their base of operations.
Whole Cake Island Saga

The Blackbeard Pirates later attacked
Baltigo

and
SWORD
, attacked Hachinosu to rescue Koby who had been imprisoned on the island, though Sanjuan Wolf was sleeping while the attack happened.
At one moment, he was thrown into the ocean by Garp.
After he was rescued, he and the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates surrounded Garp as the Marine laid on the ground, being stabbed in the chest with an icicle by
Kuzan
.
Elbaph Arc

Wolf assisted in the reconstruction of Hachinosu, picking up and placing down buildings, although his large frame knocked over other buildings. He later listened in during Teach's meeting with the Titanic Captains.
