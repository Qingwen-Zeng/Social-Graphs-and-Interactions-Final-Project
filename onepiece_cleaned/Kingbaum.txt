Kingbaum
is a tree
homie
, a member of the
Big Mom Pirates
, and the master of the Seducing Woods on
Whole Cake Island
.
However, he was forced to serve the
Straw Hat Pirates
due to them possessing
Charlotte Linlin
's
Vivre Card
.
Appearance
[
]
Kingbaum is an extremely large tree homie with a wide light gray trunk and a large amount of blueish gray foliage. He has small eyes, a very long and pointy nose, a very long handlebar mustache, a mouth full of sharp teeth, a large tongue, and two rather small arms that cannot even reach across his body.
During
Luffy
and
Cracker
's battle, the top of Kingbaum's head was cut off, removing most of his branches.
When the Big Mom Pirates' army attacked the Straw Hats, Kingbaum was bisected vertically by Amande.
However, he was later stitched back together.
After being struck with Big Mom's "Ikoku" technique, Kingbaum lost the upper left corner of his body, just before reaching the eye but after reaching the left arm, down to the waist.
After suffering a direct hit from
Prometheus
, Kingbaum was left burnt char black.
Personality
[
]
Kingbaum takes his duties very seriously and will ensure that all intruders in the Seducing Woods are killed. He carries some pride with his position, viewing outside assistance as unnecessary and being confident in the abilities of himself and his subordinates. He is the only
homie
so far to not fear
Charlotte Cracker
; like other homies, however, he fears the power of a
Vivre Card
containing
Big Mom
's soul.
He has a habit of adding the suffix
-ju
to the end of his sentences,
which is a reading of one of the kanji for "tree"
(
樹
?
)
. In the English dub, Kingbaum is given a faint German accent, while including flora-based puns into his speech.
Relationships
[
]
Sanji Retrieval Team
[
]
When the
Sanji Retrieval Team
entered the
Seducing Woods
, Kingbaum helped lead the
homies
' attacks against them until his duties were taken over by
Cracker
. When
Nami
and
Pound
attempted to run away from Cracker's fight with
Luffy
, Kingbaum aided in the pursuit, but was suddenly stopped by
Big Mom
's
Vivre Card
that was in Nami's possession.
Due to the Vivre Card's
power
, Kingbaum and the other homies became subservient to Nami, which led Cracker to label him as a traitor even though it was against his will.
After Cracker was defeated, Kingbaum was forced to continue serving the Straw Hats, and took them out of the Seducing Woods.
After the crew's escape from the
Tea Party
, Nami used the remaining half of the Vivre Card to force a resurrected Kingbaum to continue his servitude for her.
Charlotte Family and Big Mom Pirates
[
]
Charlotte Brûlée
[
]
Kingbaum often worked in conjunction with
Brûlée
to take out intruders in the Seducing Woods, and the two were often seen together.
Charlotte Cracker
[
]
Kingbaum was miffed when
Cracker
took over his group's job of taking out the Straw Hats, but Cracker did not care for what the homie had to say.
When Kingbaum became subservient to the Straw Hats, Cracker was angered by the homie helping them, declaring him a traitor and vowing to bring him before Big Mom,
though Cracker was defeated before he could take action against Kingbaum.
Charlotte Amande
[
]
Amande
was completely intolerant of Kingbaum's betrayal to Big Mom even though it was unwilling. Ignoring the homie's pleas, Amande exacted ruthless punishment against him. She even denied him a swift, painless death in favor of a torturous execution.
Prometheus
[
]
When Kingbaum betrayed Linlin for the sake of his
fiancée
,
Prometheus
called him a traitor and viciously incinerated the master of the Seducing Woods. Kingbaum looked up at Prometheus with tremendous fear at incurring the special homie's wrath.
Lady Tree
[
]
Lady Tree
is Kingbaum's fiancé.
She took care of Kingbaum after Amande bisected him and stitched him back together, bringing him back to life, shortly before the Sanji Retrieval Team use him to pass through the Seducing Woods during their escape from the
Big Mom Pirates
.
Kingbaum was willing to betray Big Mom in the hopes of returning to Lady Tree alive.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As master of the Seducing Woods, Kingbaum has authority over all the
homies
and other people stationed in it. Under his command, no intruder had managed to leave the Seducing Woods alive, with the exception of
Urouge
and the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
He was able to survive even with the top part of his head cut off horizontally, with no apparent impediment on his viability;
only when Amande fully sliced him vertically in half did he die
—though even this was not final, as he was able to be resurrected once his two halves were stitched together. The scar did cause him pain, but he was able to continue running without any impediment.
Jinbe
noted that traveling on Kingbaum was faster than running themselves.

Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
When
Charlotte Cracker
arrived at the Seducing Woods in order to take over attacking the
Sanji Retrieval Team
, Kingbaum and
Charlotte Brûlée
grew offended, stating that they would have assuredly taken care of the team without Cracker's help. While
Nami
and
Pound
were fleeing the scene, Kingbaum, Brûlée, and the
homies
pursued them until Nami took out a
Vivre Card
. The homies halted their advance when they felt Big Mom's soul from the Vivre Card.
As Nami tried to tell
Luffy
to retreat, Kingbaum and Brûlée confronted her and Pound. With Pound's assistance, Nami managed to overpower Brûlée, shocking Kingbaum and the other homies.
While the homies were afraid of getting involved in Cracker and Luffy's battle, Nami asked them whom they feared more: Cracker or Big Mom. They answered that Nami scared them more than either of the Charlottes.
Kingbaum is reprimanded by Cracker for unwillingly protecting Nami due to her carrying Big Mom's Vivre Card.
Luffy and Cracker's battle lasted for eleven hours, and the top of Kingbaum's head was cut off sometime in the process. Kingbaum was forced to protect Nami from Cracker, allowing her to create rain that weakened Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers. Kingbaum grew increasingly concerned as Luffy and Cracker continued chipping at each other's stamina.
Cracker told Kingbaum that he would report his unwillingness to attack Nami to Big Mom as insubordination. Kingbaum replied that he had no choice when facing Big Mom's Vivre Card, but Cracker did not accept his excuse.
Luffy managed to defeat Cracker, and Kingbaum reflected in shock that he assisted in Cracker's defeat, wondering in anger how Nami got Big Mom's Vivre Card. Luffy then ordered Kingbaum to take him and Nami to the
Whole Cake Chateau
. Kingbaum then carried Luffy and Nami on top of his head as they traveled to Big Mom's castle. After leaving the Seducing Woods, they caught up to a
Germa Kingdom
carriage that was transporting the
Vinsmoke Family
to Sweet City.
Kingbaum watched as
Sanji
rejected Luffy and severely beat him.
Amande bisects Kingbaum.
After Sanji left with his family, Kingbaum panicked as a storm appeared and informed Nami that Big Mom was enraged. He later watched as an army marched towards Luffy and began to fight him.
During the battle against the Enraged Army,
Charlotte Amande
sliced Kingbaum as punishment for assisting Luffy and Nami despite the homies' pleas, killing him, while making sure to make it as slow and torturous as possible.
His halves lay on the battlefield, and several hours later, Luffy reunited with Sanji there. As the two interacted, Luffy slapped Sanji, sending him crashing into Kingbaum's remains.
The next day, Kingbaum was brought back to life when his two halves were stitched together, and he romanced with
Lady Tree
. However, the Sanji Retrieval Team immediately ran into him as they were trying to escape, and forced Kingbaum to carry them once again with Big Mom's Vivre Card as the Big Mom Pirates pursued them. Suddenly, a crazed Big Mom herself came flying in on
Zeus
, intent on getting cake from the Straw Hats.
Kingbaum attacks his fellow homies.
As he ran away from the crazed Big Mom, the latter transformed
Napoleon
into a sword and used it to cut part of Kingbaum's body off. Kingbaum screamed in pain while pleading to Big Mom that his services to the Straw Hats were against his will. Nami then questioned him about the tree homie he was with and Kingbaum revealed that the tree homie was his fiancée, which Nami told him that should be his reason to live. Kingbaum acknowledged that she was right and fled from the
Emperor
. Reaching the Seducing Woods, the other homies made way for Kingbaum but as the Straw Hats expressed relief at almost escaping, Zeus appeared. Terrified to see Zeus, Kingbaum panicked and was given more reason to do so as Big Mom had ordered the tree homies to stop the Straw Hats. As the other homies started to impede the crew, Kingbaum noted that he himself was powerless against an order from his master but remembered that he had to live for his fiancée. Kingbaum then charged through his subordinates, but
Prometheus
called out to him, noting that his actions were a direct betrayal before attacking Kingbaum and setting him alight as the Straw Hats evacuated.
Linlin walked past Kingbaum's charred body as she continued her pursuit.
