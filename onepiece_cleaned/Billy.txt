Loguetown Arc (Novel)
[
]
While drinking with his subordinates in
Loguetown
, Billy was surrounded by a group of
Marines
led by
Tashigi
, who had come to arrest him. After boasting about his power, he ordered his subordinates to swarm Tashigi, and was shocked when she successfully fought them off. Angry, he charged at her himself, and she used his momentum to push him into a wall, allowing her to attack him from behind. Her attack hit him on his left side, and he collapsed. With Billy and his men seemingly defeated, Tashigi ordered her men to arrest them.
A few minutes later, however, Billy managed to throw off the Marines arresting him, standing back up. He noticed Tashigi on the floor looking for her glasses and charged at her, intending to kill her. As he reached to grab her, he was suddenly lifted up into the air by
Smoker
, who admonished Tashigi for not knocking him out properly. Billy struggled in the air, but Smoker clenched his
smoke fist
, knocking him out, and dropped him on the floor.
