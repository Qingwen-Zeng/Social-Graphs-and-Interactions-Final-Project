Like the other members of the Orochi Oniwabanshu, Hanzo is loyal to the shogun Orochi and is dedicated to his job. While appearing calm most of the time he is on the job, he became gripped by fear when he encountered the renowned kunoichi
Shinobu
.

Despite his large size, Hanzo is extremely acrobatic, and spends most of his time hanging and crawling on the ceiling. As a member of the Orochi Oniwabanshu, Hanzo is an extremely skilled ninja, having snuck up on
Nico Robin
with his comrades,
sneaking through Orochi's banquet hall without attracting attention (although he was noticed by Robin),
and sneaking up on
Nami

History

Past
[
]
In the anime, Hanzo was part of the Kouzuki Family Oniwabanshu.
20 years ago, Hanzo was present in the Flower Capital to witness
Kouzuki Oden
's execution.
When
Shinobu
began telling the truth behind Oden's foolish behavior, the Oniwabanshu appeared behind her and stopped her talking.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After seeing the geisha
O-Robi
suspiciously sneaking around Orochi Castle during
Orochi
's banquet, Hanzo and the rest of the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
snuck up on her
body double
and cornered her in a room.
When Robin's body double claimed to be
Ushimitsu Kozo
, Hanzo restrained her with a rope as the Oniwabanshu moved in to attack, but the body double then disappeared.
Fukurokuju
sent the Oniwabanshu to look for the real Robin, and Hanzo crawled on the ceiling of the banquet hall and looked around.
He eventually crawled into the space above the ceiling and caught
Nami
and
Shinobu
peeking into the hall. He correctly identified Shinobu at first, but then doubted it was her because she was no longer as beautiful. Outraged, Shinobu threw a projectile into his groin, which incapacitated him. Shinobu then broke through the floor, causing Hanzo to fall into the banquet hall below.
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
began causing chaos at Rasetsu Town after
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution, the Orochi Oniwabanshu entered the battle.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Hanzo accompanied Orochi to
Onigashima
.
After
Kaidou
disposed of Orochi for his
New Onigashima Project
, Hanzo did not object to Fukurokuju swearing the Oniwabanshu's allegiance to Kaidou when given the choice of joining the
Beasts Pirates
or death.
As the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
waged war on Onigashima, the Oniwabanshu fought against the rebels.
After
Queen
unleashed the
Ice Oni
virus, Hanzo and his allies found themselves under attack by those infected.
When the little
Hyougoro
, infected with the Ice Oni, again became the former boss of the yakuza, which he did in his youth, the Orochi Oniwabanshu were amazed at this fact, asking what happened to him and how the old man became the one Kaidou wanted to get on his team.
