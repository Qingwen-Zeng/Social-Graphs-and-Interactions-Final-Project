Crab-Hand Gyro
is the captain of the
Gyro Pirates
from
South Blue
that was on its way to the
New World
before an unfortunate meeting with the
New Fish-Man Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Gyro is a skinny man of average height with a child-like, oval face, and a square nose. He has two red distinctive spots on his cheeks, dark hair, beard and mustache, he's missing a tooth and has what appears to be a massive
four leaf clover
on top of his head. He also has well-developed pectorals and abdominal muscles.
He sports a bicorne adorned with his
Jolly Roger
, tied around his neck with a string, much like
Luffy
with his
straw hat
. He wears a partially unbuttoned black vest underneath a light blue captain's coat worn with the arms in the sleeves, with the left sleeve being cut right below his elbow, and has a large buckled belt hanging on his chest from his right shoulder. He wears striped pants reaching down to his calves, with many purple and white stripes at the ends, and sandals. He carries around a
katana
with him.
His most distinctive feature, as well as the source of his
epithet
, is the giant crab claw where his left hand should be. It is orange and made of metal with spikes coming out of the arm. This is a weapon attachment, as his human arm is seen bitten off and floating next to him after being defeated by
Hody Jones
.
Personality
[
]
He is a very logical man, as he knew he had to join the
New Fish-Man Pirates
, as he could not fight them underwater, and that it was better to flee when he and his crew had the chance, rather than to stay for
Mermaid Cafe
(as they all originally hoped) or fight against the Fish-Men since he wasn't going to bow down to the
New Fishman Pirates
. However, his past experience of fighting against Fish-Men gave him a sense of confidence against Hody when they were forced to fight him, and thought he could defeat the New Fish-Man Pirates captain, which led to his utter defeat instead.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the captain, he has command over his crew. Gyro stated that Hody Jones is not the first
Fish-Man
who he fought against, and that he overcame many dangers of
Paradise
, something proven by his presence on Fish-Man Island, which indicates some level of competence and experience.
Weapons
[
]
He carries a sword with a clover-shaped handguard charged to the right side of his waist and with his bounty, he is presumed to be skilled in swordsmanship. His crab claw is assumed to be a weapon as well, as he was seen readying it to fend off Jones when the Fish-Man attacked his ship, but Hody destroyed it.
History

Past
[
]
At some point, he and his crew left South Blue and traveled through Paradise and eventually made it to Fish-Man Island. After escaping the
Kraken
, who was asleep at the time, he and his crew were forced to join the New Fish-Man Pirates under the same threat that
Hammond
gave to the Straw Hats: being servants or sinking before entering the island.
Fish-Man Island Arc
[
]
Gyro's defeat at the hands of Hody.
He and his crew eventually found an opportunity to escape and took it. Gyro told one of his complaining subordinates to forget about the Mermaid Cafe and that they are never returning to Fish-Man Island. Before they can get very far, they were confronted by
Hody Jones
. With just his jaws, the Fish-Man began tearing apart Gyro's ship as well as his crew. Gyro attempted to fight Hody himself, but was utterly defeated when Hody bit off his crab claw.
Afterwards, Gyro and his men were left alive sent up to the surface in a bubble, as part of Hody's intention to spread word to humanity about the dangers of Fish-Men.
