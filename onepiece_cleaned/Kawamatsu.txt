Kawamatsu the Kappa
is a
Japanese puffer
fish-man
who is a
yokozuna
-ranked sumo wrestler. As a child, he was shipwrecked in Wano and orphaned soon afterwards. After
Kouzuki Oden
rescued him from an attempted lynching, he went on to serve as one of Oden's
Nine Red Scabbards
until Oden's death 20 years ago.
After spending 7 years watching over Oden's daughter
Hiyori
, Kawamatsu was imprisoned by the
Beasts Pirates
for 13 years until
Monkey D. Luffy
ultimately freed him. He then reunited with the Nine Red Scabbards and joined their effort to fight
Kurozumi Orochi
and
Kaidou
and avenge Oden.
He is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Kawamatsu is a large Japanese puffer fish-man whose appearance could be mistaken with that of a
kappa
. As such, he has webbed hands and light yellow-green skin. Being almost as tall as
Raizo
at 271Â cm,
he has a round body, two blush marks on his cheeks, a beak-like mouth and extremely long and wild orange hair. He wears a green kimono, a red cape, tan sandals, a yellow sash tied around his waist, and a large tan
kasa
with a dark diamond shape at its top.
Personality
[
]
Kawamatsu is an extremely kind and caring person, as shown by his care for
Kouzuki Hiyori
and his efforts to make her laugh after the trauma she went through.
When one of the Beasts Pirates attempted to attack Luffy, Kawamatsu silently aided him by piercing his attacker with a fishbone. His compassion is best shown when he encountered an impoverished
Onimaru
and fed him with his limited amount of food, despite there being barely enough for himself. Due to his mother insisting that he impersonates a kappa to protect himself from the citizens of Wano Country, he takes the role quite seriously, never introducing himself as a fish-man but as a kappa, barring to Oden, whom he trust and admire.
Kawamatsu also possesses a
unique laugh
: "Kappappappa".
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Renona Topakka
[
]
Kawamatsu appeared to be very close to his mother, as she protected him from discrimination until one event led to her demise. In her dying moments, Topakka told her son to act as a kappa for better survival chances.
To honor his mother, Kawamatsu obediently heeded her last words for many years and has continued to refer to himself as a kappa in the present. He even named his personal swordsmanship style after it.
Allies
[
]
Nine Red Scabbards
[
]
Kawamatsu, alongside the other Red Scabbards (with Izou taking Kanjuro's place), charges into battle.
As a member of the
Nine Red Scabbards
, Kawamatsu got along well with his fellow members and retainers and proudly served alongside them under Kouzuki Oden. After Oden's death, Kawamatsu prioritized saving Oden's child Hiyori, and split off from the rest of the scabbards. Like Denjiro and Ashura Doji, Kawamatsu spent the following 20 years awaiting the return of Momonosuke and the remaining Scabbards, and was glad upon hearing news of their return while in prison. Kawamatsu was extremely grateful to reunite with Raizo, shocked that he had not aged a day. Like the other Scabbards, he was shocked by Kanjuro's betrayal. Despite Kanjuro's betrayal, Kawamatsu and the other Scabbards, alongside
Izou
, another of Oden's retainers, continued the assault on Onigashima and even fought alongside each other against Kaidou.
Kouzuki Family
[
]
Kawamatsu trying to cheer Hiyori up by dancing after the trauma of losing her family.
As a small child,
Kouzuki Oden
saved Kawamatsu from death by discriminatory humans and offered him freshly cooked food, which Kawamatsu was extremely grateful for. From then on, Kawamatsu became one of Oden's most loyal followers. His trust in Oden is such that he revealed his heritage as a fish-man to him despite his mother's dying words for him to hide it to protect himself from persecution. In turn, Oden entrusted Kawamatsu, along with the other retainers, with his dream to open the borders of Wano Country.
As Oden's retainer, Kawamatsu is also extremely loyal to his lord's children. He was the one who helped young
Hiyori
escape from their enemies at Oden Castle and took care of her for 7 years during her childhood, even endured long term starvation to ensure Hiyori had enough food, making Hiyori chose to ran away out of concern for him. When she ran away, Kawamatsu desperately searched for her and was filled with regret when he could not find her. After reuniting with Raizo after twenty years, the first thing he did was asking about
Momonosuke
's safety, showing his concern for Oden's son. Unlike Ashura Doji (who refused at first), Kawamatsu had been eager to join the Kouzuki Family in the war against Orochi and Kaidou. When reuniting with Hiyori after many years, they were extremely overjoyed to see each other again. He also tried to rescue Momonosuke when the latter was captured by Kanjuro and he was enraged when Kanjuro declared that he will hunt down Hiyori.
Shimotsuki Yasuie
[
]
In his youth, Kawamatsu tried to steal money from
Yasuie
along with the Nine Red Scabbards only to get caught. Yasuie held no grudge against him and his retainer comrades. Instead, he convinced them to behave as real retainers to support their lord Oden and Wano while freely giving them the money. When Orochi killed his benefactor, he grieved for his death as he watched his execution.
Onimaru
[
]
Kawamatsu first met
Onimaru
13 years ago, who chased some members of the Beasts Pirates. Kawamatsu nursed the wounded komakitsune back to health. At first, Onimaru was hostile towards Kawamatsu, refusing to let the samurai collect the weapons of the buried in Ringo but he relented when Kawamatsu offered him his arm. He and Onimaru then worked together to protect the graves from robbers.
However, less than a year later, Kawamatsu was captured and Onimaru inherited the name "Gyukimaru". In the present day, when Kawamatsu interfered in "Gyukimaru" and Zoro's battle, Onimaru expresses with tears of joy upon learning that Kawamatsu is still alive. After the
raid on Onigashima
, Kawamatsu reunited with Onimaru.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Kawamatsu first saw
Luffy
when he was brought to Udon as a prisoner and protected the latter when a Beasts Pirate attempted to attack him for defiance. As Kawamatsu continued to observe Luffy, he was deeply impressed with Luffy not only in his courage to stand up against the Beasts Pirates but also in his compassion in helping Hyougoro. He even trusted Luffy to protect Hyougoro from being executed in Queen's execution games. After Luffy was freed and planned to start a rebellion, Kawamatsu encouraged Luffy to inspire fellow prisoners to rebel by announcing the Kouzuki Family's revolution and happily joined Luffy in preparing to fight the Beasts Pirates.
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
Kawamatsu first encountered
Zoro
at Ohagi Bridge when the latter was fighting Gyukimaru to retrieve Shusui. When Hiyori offered her father's heirloom Enma to Zoro as a replacement for Shusui, Kawamatsu strongly protested and even considered Zoro delusional when he claimed to have fought Ryuma. Nevertheless, Kawamatsu relented when Hiyori decided to put her faith in Zoro.
When Zoro confidently decided to accept Enma as his new sword despite how difficult it was to master, Kawamatsu expressed great praise for him.
Enemies
[
]
Beasts Pirates
[
]
During his 13 years of imprisonment at the prisoner mines, Kawamatsu refused to submit to his enemies and defiantly stayed in his cell chained up. After being freed, he wasted no time in attacking them with his reunited allies.
Kurozumi Orochi
[
]
When meeting Raizo again after many years in Udon prison, Kawamatsu expressed eagerness in joining the cause to overthrow
Orochi
. Also, Orochi was the one who ordered the
Beasts Pirates
to feed him poisonous fish for the past thirteen years to kill him in a slow and painful way.
Kurozumi Kanjuro
[
]
Originally, they were friends and comrades for years until
Kanjuro's
true colors were revealed.
With Kanjuro confirmed to be an enemy, Kawamatsu attempted to attack him to rescue Momonosuke, but failed. It was during this encounter that Kanjuro showed his contempt for Kawamatsu, derogatorily calling him a "fish-man" instead of his name, and further enraging him by revealing his intention to find Hiyori and kill her.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a member of the Nine Red Scabbards, Kawamatsu is a powerful samurai whom
Kin'emon
states (alongside
Denjiro
and
Ashura Doji
) is worth 100 men in battle.
He is said to be the strongest sumo wrestler in Wano Country and holds the rank of yokozuna.
During the
Raid on Onigashima
, he earned the distinction of drawing blood from the former
Emperor
Kaidou
, said to be the world's "Strongest Creature", in his full dragon form.
Physical Abilities
[
]
As a fish-man, Kawamatsu has ten times the strength of an average human, and even more so underwater. However, he seems to possess amazing physical strength even for fish-man standards. He can spit out fish bones with such extreme force and speed that they are capable of seriously injuring a person.
Kawamatsu possesses immense endurance as he had been fed poisoned fish every day for thirteen years by the Beasts Pirates without dying or even suffering any illness like Tama, a feat which baffled his captors.
However, Kawamatsu did profusely vomit once he was freed.
He provided for Hiyori while starving himself.
Kawamatsu withstood Onimaru violently biting his arm and the cold winter climate of Ringo, as well as days of hunger.
He appeared largely unharmed after being sent flying through a rock formation by Kaidou.
Due to his heritage, he is a fast swimmer, which enabled him to sneak
Hiyori
out of Oden Castle.
Marksmanship
[
]
Kawamatsu can spit out fish bones with great speed and precision, potentially turning them into deadly weapons. He was able to spit one through one of the gaps in his cell and go straight to the neck of a guard.

History

Past
[
]
Kawamatsu and his mother are attacked by humans.
When Kawamatsu was a child, he and his mother drifted to
Wano Country
after their ship sank. When they tried to find help, the
humans
threw stones at them. Before dying, his mother told him that
fish-men
suffered discrimination and since then, Kawamatsu posed as a kappa.
33 years ago, Kawamatsu discovered
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
at
Kuri Beach
after the two
minks
drifted to Wano.
Afterwards, the three were caught and persecuted by some humans until
Kouzuki Oden
came and rescued them. They then followed Oden back to Kuri and became his retainers.
When they were running low on funds, the retainers attempted to steal money from
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, but they were caught. Instead of punishing them, Yasuie allowed them to take the money and encouraged them to use it to become better people for the sake of Oden and Wano.
Following Yasuie's advice, they educated themselves and trained to become dignified warriors. 30 years ago, they visited the
Flower Capital
with Oden.
After Oden,
Izou
, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi left Wano with the
Whitebeard Pirates
, Kawamatsu and his fellow remaining retainers protected Kuri. When Oden and the two minks returned to Wano with the
Roger Pirates
, the retainers greeted Oden, but before they could say anymore,
Kouzuki Toki
stopped them from convincing Oden to stay in Wano so he could continue his journey with
Gol D. Roger
.
Around six months before Oden finished his voyage, the retainers were furious at
Kurozumi Orochi
for abusing his position as shogun. Kawamatsu and Inuarashi stayed behind at Oden Castle while the others marched to the Flower Capital to confront Orochi. A group of
Beasts Pirates
attacked Oden Castle, but Kawamatsu and Inuarashi repelled them. When Oden returned to Wano after finishing his journey, the retainers (except
Denjiro
and
Ashura Doji
, who were elsewhere at the time) welcomed him back and told him about Wano's situation. Oden then ordered his retainers to protect his family and Kuri before charging to the capital by himself.
After Oden failed to kill Orochi, the retainers remained loyal to him for the next five years despite Oden acting like a fool and losing the respect of most of Wano's people. 20 years ago, Oden finally had enough and decided to take down
Kaidou
. The retainers eagerly followed him and marched with him to
Onigashima
.
On the way to Onigashima, the group was confronted by Kaidou and his crew in the
Udon
region. In the ensuing battle, the
samurai
were joined by
Shinobu
. Unfortunately, the samurai were overwhelmed in the end. Oden and the
Nine Red Scabbards
were then imprisoned in the Flower Capital and sentenced to be boiled alive in three days.
All ten prisoners were later brought to the execution site, at which point Oden made a deal with Kaidou. After Oden stepped into the pot of boiling oil, the retainers were about to join him, but Oden grabbed a plank and ordered them to stand on it as he held them over the pot.
As Oden endured
the hour
, he explained to his retainers the reason Wano Country was isolated and requested them to open Wano's borders for him. Oden successfully survived the hour, but Orochi summoned a firing squad to execute Oden and his retainers. Oden once again told his retainers to open Wano's borders before throwing them far away from the pot. The Scabbards fled with tears as Oden met his demise.
Kawamatsu rescues Hiyori.
The retainers ran back to Kuri with an army of pursuers chasing after them. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi were caught while Denjiro and Ashura split from the group to fight their enemies. The remaining retainers discovered Oden Castle set on fire by the Beasts Pirates, but they found Oden's wife and children inside. Toki sent
Kin'emon
,
Kanjuro
,
Raizo
, and
Kikunojo
20 years into the future with
Momonosuke
while Kawamatsu stayed with the 6-year old
Hiyori
as a precaution to ensure that the
Kouzuki Family
blood survived in case their plan failed. As the castle was surrounded by enemies, Kawamatsu dove into a water channel so the pair could escape unnoticed.
Taking care of Hiyori, he always tried to cheer her up and would let himself go hungry so she had enough to eat. While Hiyori was initially mute, over time he was able to make her laugh.
Kawamatsu collects weapons.
After seven years of taking care of Hiyori, she wrote a letter for him and left. When Kawamatsu found and read it, he cried and unsuccessfully searched across Wano for her. To find another purpose in life, he ventured into Ringo's graveyard to collect the swords from the graves in order to arm the rebels for the day Momonosuke and his retainers return. Despite the initial resistance of the fox Onimaru who guarded the graveyard from grave robbers, he managed to convince the fox to help him with his cause while at the same time joining forces together to protect the cemetery. As the swords in the cemetery were not enough, Kawamatsu forced the grave robbers to surrender their weapons every time he chased them out. Kawamatsu also invented the name "Gyukimaru" to mask his identity.
He was later caught when he was stealing abura-age in the Flower Capital.
He was then imprisoned in
Udon
and kept chained in a cell, where he was fed only poisonous bone-less fish on
Kurozumi Orochi
's orders.
From eating fish over the course of 13 years, his insides turned over and over each day, though the experience paled in comparison to his regret of being unable to help Oden.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After
Monkey D. Luffy
was brought to Udon, Kawamatsu spat a fishbone at one of the guards when the guard attempted to attack Luffy.
He later witnessed
Dobon
's confrontation with Luffy and
Eustass Kid
.
When Luffy and
Hyougoro
were brought before
Queen
, Kawamatsu called out to
Raizo
while the ninja was in front of his cell. After revealing himself, he asked if Momonosuke was okay.
He then asked Raizo to help him escape so he could join the decisive battle against the
Beasts Pirates
during the
Fire Festival
. Raizo was spotted and forced to disappear in a smokescreen. Kawamatsu then noticed how Luffy had been causing a commotion and prayed that he would not let Hyougoro die.
Sometime during the Sumo Inferno, Kawamatsu commented that he wanted to try a sumo match as well.
On the next day, Kawamatsu watched the broadcast of Yasuie's execution with tears in his eyes.
Kawamatsu joins his allies.
During a fight between Queen and
Big Mom
, Kawamatsu's cell was damaged.
When
Babanuki
turned the prisoners against Luffy, Kawamatsu got everyone's attention by shouting out to Luffy. After Babanuki revealed Kawamatsu's identity, some guards attempted to kill him, but Kawamatsu kept them at bay by spitting fishbones until Raizo tossed him
Soto Muso
and the key to his handcuffs. After freeing himself, Kawamatsu repelled several more guards and went into the clearing, where he joined Raizo,
Kikunojo
, Hyougoro,
Tony Tony Chopper
, and Luffy against the Beasts Pirates.
Kawamatsu and his allies fought against the Beasts Pirates, but they were soon cornered by prisoners who were infected with the Mummy virus. As Luffy swayed the prisoners, Kawamatsu noticed that Babanuki was preparing to fire something. He was then impressed when Luffy defeated Babanuki.
After the prison takeover was completed, Kawamatsu decided to temporarily leave Luffy's group to take care of some business. He promised to rejoin them before the Fire Festival.
Later, at the Oihagi Bridge, Kawamatsu interrupted the fight between
Roronoa Zoro
and
Gyukimaru
and Hiyori reunited with him. However, the reunion was interrupted when some Beasts Pirates arrived seeking revenge on Gyukimaru for stealing their weapons. Kawamatsu and Zoro fought the Beasts Pirates as Gyukimaru fled.
Kawamatsu informs Kin'emon about the weapon stash in Ringo.
After the Beasts Pirates were defeated, Kawamatsu got reacquainted with Hiyori and told her of his ordeals after they separated. He told her of the story of
Shimotsuki Ushimaru
and his fox companion Onimaru. They caught up with Zoro at a passageway leading to an underground chamber where Kawamatsu kept a stash of weapons. Kawamatsu entered the secret room alone and spoke to Kin'emon via Smart Tanishi and informed him of the weapon stash.
He later went back outside and objected to Hiyori offering
Enma
to Zoro in exchange for
Shusui
's return. He was also skeptical of Zoro's claim of fighting
Ryuma
's
corpse
. Hiyori then told Kawamatsu and Zoro that she would not be joining them in meeting their allies as she did not want to distract them from their preparations for war. After leaving Hiyori in a safe place, Kawamatsu and Zoro joined a meeting with Kin'emon at Amigasa Village.
They then told the group at Amigasa Village that Hiyori is alive. After
Tenguyama Hitetsu
gave Enma to Zoro, Kawamatsu was impressed to see Zoro taming Enma. On the day for the raid on Onigashima, Kawamatsu marched to the rebel meeting place with Momonosuke, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, Ashura, Inuarashi, Shinobu, and Kikunojo.
The group eventually arrived at the meeting place, but found none of their ships and allies.
In spite of this major setback, the Scabbards were still determined to go through with the raid, knowing that they would not get another chance.
The Scabbards set sail and left Momonosuke at the port. As Kin'emon wondered about the possibility of a traitor among them, Kanjuro then revealed that he was the mole, leaving the other Scabbards stunned at this revelation. After Kanjuro explained what he did, Kin'emon angrily beheaded him, only to learn that it was a copy and the real Kanjuro remained on the coast and that he had captured Momonosuke to bring him to Onigashima. As this was happening, the Scabbards' boat was confronted by three Beasts Pirates ships, but the ships were suddenly attacked by the Straw Hats, Heart Pirates, and Kid Pirates. The Scabbards' boat was then lifted by Law's submarine.
When Kyoshiro arrived, the Scabbards were confused to see him attacking one of the Beasts Pirates ships. They were then shocked when Kyoshiro revealed himself to be Denjiro and that he freed the prisoners in the Flower Capital and the rebels gathered at Port Habu. To their relief, the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
allies arrived at Port Tokage on a massive fleet to commence the raid on Onigashima.
Kawamatsu fights with Kanjuro to save Momonosuke.
With the Scabbards' hopes renewed, Kawamatsu swam back to the coast and attacked Kanjuro, but the latter conjured a crane and escaped with Momonosuke in tow. Having failed to retrieve Momonosuke, Kawamatsu rejoined the Scabbards on the
Polar Tang
. As the alliance was attacked by a Beasts Pirates ship with long ranged cannons, the rebels were aided by
Jinbe
.
After
Shishilian
and Hyougoro boarded the Polar Tang, the Scabbards discussed with Law about the plan to enter Onigashima.
After the Straw Hats defeated the guards at the torii gates, the Heart Pirates and the Scabbards (except Kin'emon and Denjiro) traversed to the back of Onigashima inside the Polar Tang.
Along the way, they were contacted by Nekomamushi, who just arrived and was planning to meet them at Onigashima.
When the submarine got close enough, Law teleported himself and the Scabbards with him to Onigashima's back entrance, where they were joined up by
Marco
, Nekomamushi, and
Izou
.
After Marco left to check on a shadow he saw at sea, the group was confronted by Kanjuro and an army of Beasts Pirates. While Kikunojo clashed against Kanjuro, the rest fought the other enemies.
Kanjuro and the Beasts Pirates with him were defeated, and Kawamatsu's group were soon rejoined by Kin'emon and Denjiro. They then entered Kaidou's castle, fought their way to the Performance Stage, and launched an all-out attack on Kaidou.
While falling to the lower floor, the Scabbards managed to inflict wounds on Kaidou. As the alliance revealed themselves and attacked the Beasts Pirates, Kaidou transformed into his dragon form and flew to the roof of the Skull Dome, with the Scabbards grabbing onto him. On the roof, the Scabbards prepared to fight Kaidou with the Mink Tribe's help.
Kawamatsu attacks Kaidou.
Jack and a platoon arrived at the roof to assist Kaidou, and the Scabbards watched as the
Sulong
minks engaged the enemy.
After Jack and his forces were rendered unable to battle thanks to the minks' efforts, the Scabbards resumed their confrontation with Kaidou.
Kaidou roared lightning at them, but they dodged around it and each struck him in turn.
After suffering several injuries, Kaidou then retaliated with a roar that created wind scythes aimed at the Scabbards.
Continuing the battle in human form, Kaidou began overwhelming the Scabbards
and later incapacitated them. Big Mom, Kid, Killer, Zoro, Luffy, and Law later arrived at the roof. Upon Luffy's request, Law teleported the Scabbards to a safe place.
They were placed in the treasure room on the second floor, where a mysterious person was tending to them.
The Scabbards later recovered and regained consciousness, but the mysterious figure already had left. Before they left the treasure room, they saw who appeared to be Oden.
Many of the Scabbards believed it was him; however, "Oden" was quickly exposed to be a drawing made by Kanjuro, who was still alive and heading for Momonosuke. The Oden drawing then lit a large quantity of
dynamite
under its garment, but Ashura Doji tackled it out of the room before it exploded, sacrificing himself to save his comrades.
The Scabbards immediately headed out to find Kanjuro, but were then confronted by Beasts Pirates All-Star
Jack
; Inuarashi stayed behind to battle him.
As they raced through the fortress, they encountered Orochi and
Fukurokuju
. Orochi transformed into the
Yamata no Orochi
to take on the Scabbards, but they responded by swiftly decapitating his multiple heads at once. They continued on, with Raizo staying behind to fight Fukurokuju.
Kawamatsu and Izou later separated from the other Scabbards and ran into
Sanji
carrying an incapacitated
Roronoa Zoro
, and the four headed to the Live Floor together.
The group arrived at the Live Floor to hear the announcement of Luffy's defeat, which Kawamatsu noted were unverifiable events.
He would then prevent some Beasts Pirates from shooting at Zoro by slicing them up. Later, after he witnessed Zoro fighting King on the Live Floor, Kawamatsu discussed the similarities between Zoro and Shimotsuki Ushimaru as well as Shisui being returned to Wano when Zoro traded it for Enma with Hyougoro, to which both concluded it must have been fate that the Straw Hats came to Wano.
Kawamatsu later ordered the samurai to find a way to escape the castle as they could not put out the fire, seeing no honor in being burned alive.
After Nekomamushi announced that Luffy had defeated Kaidou and that Momonosuke had safely landed the island, the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance celebrated their victory. When a volcano erupted where Onigashima once sat, Momonosuke flew with his sister and retainers into the Flower Capital in order to calm the panicking citizens. As the citizens marveled at the return of the Nine Red Scabbards, Denjiro then announced Momonosuke as the new Shogun of Wano Country. After broadcasting a speech to the whole country, Momonosuke, along with his retainers, entered the shogun's castle.
The samurai ready to protect Luffy from Ryokugyu.
A week later, Kawamatsu and Kin'emon sat at the Northern Cemetery and discussed building a temple for Oden, surrounded by graves for the fallen daimyo, Izou, and Ashura. The two were then joined by Onimaru and Marco.
That evening, when the Kouzuki Retainers noticed
Admiral
Ryokugyu
's approach, several of them, including Raizo, went out to stop him from entering the Flower Capital. Using
his Devil Fruit powers
, Ryokugyu attacked the samurai and announced his intent to go after Luffy. They were joined by Yamato and Momonosuke, and the retainers became distressed as Ryokugyu restrained Momonosuke.
Just as they were about to be attacked by Ryogukyu again,
Shanks
from outside Wano stopped Ryoguyku and forced him to leave Wano.
Kawamatsu later joined his fellow Scabbards alongside Yamato and Momonosuke when the latter took his place as the new Shogun of Wano.
