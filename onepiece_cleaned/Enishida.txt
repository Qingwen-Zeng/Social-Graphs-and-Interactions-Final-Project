Amazon Lily Arc
[

After Boa Hancock returned to
Amazon Lily
, Enishida showed her the statue that the children had made of her out of clay. When Hancock destroyed the statue, she instructed Enishida to clean up the mess and to never bring such an object to her again. After Hancock asked her warriors why they were missing from her arrival, Enishida explained that they were investigating a "dangerous monkey". When
Elder Nyon
arrived, Hancock told Enishida to throw her out, but the two women began to argue before she had a chance to do so.
Later, after Hancock had revealed her past to
Luffy
, Enishida rushed to Elder Nyon and Luffy, informing them that Hancock had collapsed from an unknown disease. She was relieved to see Hancock later woken up, and later accompanied her to
Impel Down
.
