Zunesha
is a
Naitamie-Norida elephant
that was affiliated with
Joy Boy
800 years ago
.
It now wanders through the
New World
and carries the island of
Zou
on its back
as punishment for an unspecified crime it committed in the past.
Appearance
[
]
Zunesha is a gargantuan elephant, comparable to an island in sheer scale; its two-jointed
legs are disproportionately and extremely long, such that it can walk on the sea floor while its upper body, including about a third of each leg, remains above the water. However, Zunesha has comparatively small eyes (shown to have turquoise, ringed irises in the anime)
sunken deep into their sockets, being barely visible at most times and giving the impression that it has no eyes at all. Its gray skin is heavily wrinkled, reflecting its old age, and its ears are tattered and frayed at the edges.
Personality
[
]
Most of Zunesha's personality is a mystery, but it does not mind carrying a civilization on its back,
and in fact cares greatly about the Mink Tribe.
As part of the sentence for a crime it supposedly committed in the past, Zunesha is not allowed to do anything but wander around, requiring permission from someone who can understand it to act against threats to its well-being.
Miyagi
speculates that Zunesha is not walking aimlessly and may, in fact, be looking for a certain location.
Relationships

Allies

Mink Tribe
[
]
Zunesha has a commensal relationship with the
Mink Tribe
and the island of
Zou
; twice per day, it showers itself with seawater, which helps the minks acquire food in the form of fish and water via a filtration system, causing them to consider it a blessing.
When
Jack
and his fleet were attacking it, Zunesha worried about the minks dying if it were to fall into the sea and begged
Kouzuki Momonosuke
to allow it to fight before this happened. After Zunesha defeated Jack, the minks were surprised to learn that it possessed a will of its own in all the time that they have lived there.
The minks also tended to Zunesha's leg, which had been injured by Jack's attack, as they expressed gratitude to it for protecting them.
Miyagi
was excited to learn that Zunesha could understand his tribe and wanted to ask where it is going after traveling over a millennia.
Kouzuki Momonosuke
[
]
While under attack from an enemy fleet, Zunesha used the "Voice of All Things" to telepathically speak to Momonosuke so that he can give him the order to retaliate. Momonosuke obliged and gave the order, allowing the elephant to save itself. Zunesha came to Wano to assist Momonosuke and await his orders.
Joy Boy
[
]
According to
Momonosuke
, Zunesha was a comrade of
Joy Boy
back during the
Void Century
. Outside of that, the specifics of their relationship are still a mystery.
Zunesha itself states that it holds nostalgic feelings for Joy Boy and was able to recognize the sound of the Drums of Liberation even after a span of 800 years. When
Monkey D. Luffy
managed to
awaken
his
Devil Fruit
during the
Raid on Onigashima
, his presence was comparable to the individual Zunesha knew long ago.
Enemies
[
]
Jack
[
]
During his second attack on Zou, Jack decided to slaughter the minks by bringing down Zunesha.
He planned to force the elephant to its knees in order to reach its head and kill it in sadistic ways; however, Zunesha was determined to protect the minks, and with Momonosuke's permission, it annihilated Jack's fleet with one swing of its trunk.

Physical Abilities
[
]
Zunesha has immense longevity, given its so-far more than 1000 years of life. Due to its gigantic size, it can carry the whole island of Zou on its back, and as a result of its seemingly incredible endurance has been able to spend an entire millennium continuously carrying Zou whilst walking.
Zunesha can suck up and expel massive amounts of sea water, and with it lots of fish, using its trunk.
With a single swing of its trunk, it can wipe out entire fleets of ships and swiftly defeated Jack, an All-Star of the
Beasts Pirates
.
Zunesha has extraordinary eyesight and can see faraway objects in great detail.
However, due to having lived for so long, it is not very durable, so its weak and aged skin can be heavily damaged by concentrated cannon fire.
Voice of All Things
[
]
Zunesha has the "
Voice of All Things
", allowing it to telepathically communicate with others with the same ability.
History

Past
[
]
Zunesha was born a thousand years ago in the New World. At one-point, Zunesha became a companion of
Joy Boy
. 800 years ago, Zunesha committed a crime
and was sentenced to walk the seas for eternity and only act upon being ordered to do so.
Since then, it had wandered the sea of the
New World
and lived for centuries carrying the
Mink Tribe
and the other lifeforms on
Zou
.
Seventeen days before the
Straw Hat Pirates
landed on Zou,
Jack
and the
Beasts Pirates
invaded Zou. Jack's massive presence was felt by Zunesha, who roared in pain.

Zunesha wipes out Jack's fleet.
Jack and his men returned to Zou, with Jack intending to kill Zunesha.
As Jack and his fleet's attack commenced, Zunesha began shaking and crying out.
As Jack's fleet heavily damaged one of its legs, Zunesha begged
Kouzuki Momonosuke
to give it permission to fight back. After Momonosuke explained Zunesha's past and how it could not act without permission, he ordered it to drive Jack away, prompting Zunesha to wipe out Jack's fleet with a powerful swing of its trunk before resuming its walk.
With Jack defeated,
Chopper
treated Zunesha's injured leg alongside
Miyagi
and many other minks.

and encountered a large fleet of
World Government
ships.
It then conversed with Momonosuke through the

Soon afterwards, Zunesha heard the "Drums of Liberation"
(
解放のドラム
,
Kaihō no Doramu
?
)
, which herald
Joy Boy
's return.
The elephant then compared Monkey D. Luffy to the ancient Joy Boy and affirmed that it was the boy's destiny, placing his trust in him.
Following
Kaidou
's defeat, Momonosuke decided not to have Wano's borders open yet and informed Zunesha of his decision.
In respect for Momonosuke's judgment, Zunesha left Wano and vanished within the nearby mist.
