The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Later, when Zoro arrived at the hospital with an unconscious Judy, the
doctor
there checked to see if Judy had a
collar
around his neck. When Zoro questioned why it mattered, the doctor responded that the medical fees of
slaves
cost 50% more, so it would be better to just buy a new one. In response, Zoro angrily emphasized that all that mattered was that he was hurt and asked if they were going to treat him or not. Upon hearing that they would treat him right away, Zoro then handed Judy over to them.
