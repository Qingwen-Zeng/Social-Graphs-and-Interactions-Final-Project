History
[
]
Marineford
, where most of the
Marines
' families live, was empty as everyone had been evacuated to
Sabaody Archipelago
. On the archipelago, the families as well as many reporters watched giant monitors that were broadcasted from Marineford, monitoring the situation. Reuder, a journalist, and other reporters were also present, ready to deliver the news as soon as possible.
Reuder was the first among the crowd to proclaim that
Ace
had arrived at the gallows.
Later, when
Sengoku
announced that Ace is
Roger
's son, Reuder and the rest of the crowd were shocked and horrified.
He then watched the rest of the war unfold with the rest of the crowd.
