Wano Country Saga
[

Wano Country Arc
[
]
Tama takes Luffy to her master's house while riding Komachiyo.
When
Tama
came under attack by two
Beasts Pirates
sentries, Komachiyo attacked their
baboon guard
to protect her. The two animals fought viciously, and Komachiyo was thrown into the
Thousand Sunny
on the beach.
Their fight ended when Tama managed to free herself and tame the baboon, and Komachiyo and Hihimaru took Tama and
Monkey D. Luffy
to see her master,
Tenguyama Hitetsu
.
Luffy and Tama later left the house, and Komachiyo offered to carry them. They came to a wasteland, and Luffy stopped Komachiyo after spotting his crewmate
Roronoa Zoro
.
While Luffy and Zoro battled
Basil Hawkins
and his men, the woman that Zoro saved earlier,
Tsurujo
, hid herself in Komachiyo's tail. The komainu later decided to drag the two
Straw Hat Pirates
away from the battle. After fleeing from Hawkins, the komainu took Luffy, Tama, Zoro, and Tsuru to Okobore Town.
Komachiyo was happy when Tsuru healed Tama. However, during the confusion when the gifter
Batman
attacked Tsuru, Tama was abducted by another gifter
Gazelleman
. Komachiyo then pursued Gazelleman along with
Kiku
, Luffy, and Zoro and head for Bakura Town.
The group traveled through the town until they came across a sumo wrestling tournament.
After the headliner
Speed
arrived with a wagon of food and Luffy rescued Tama from
Holed'em
's clutches, Komachiyo grabbed Kiku and began running away with the wagon.
With Holed'em defeated, the group fled Bakura Town and grabbed
Trafalgar Law
along the way. They then brought the food cart to Okobore Town.
As Speed took Tama back to her home, Komachiyo took Luffy's group to the ruins of
Kouzuki Oden
's castle.
Komachiyo then sat outside as
Kin'emon
told Luffy's group about Wano's past.
The group present at Oden Castle was alarmed to see
Kaidou
's sudden arrival at Kuri. After Luffy rushed off with Law following him and Kin'emon and Kiku left to rescue Tsuru, the rest tried to escape as Kaidou approached the castle and destroyed it with a breath attack.
Komachiyo and the other males in the group were saved by the kunoichi
Shinobu
's
jutsu
which sunk them into the ground.
Komachiyo later returned to Tama's home, where Tama had her injuries treated after she was attacked by Kaidou.
Komachiyo remained in the village after Tama, Kiku,
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, and
Tony Tony Chopper
left the village to go for a walk to Kuri Beach. The komainu listened as Hitetsu spoke to them through a
Smart Tanishi
.
On the day before the
raid on Onigashima
, Komachiyo watched as Momonosuke and his group left Amigasa Village.
During the
Fire Festival
, Komachiyo went to Onigashima with Tama and Hihimaru and arrived just in time to rescue
Nami
and
Usopp
from Ulti and
Page One
.
Tama and Komachiyo then fled with the two Straw Hats while Hihimaru stayed behind to stall the two Tobiroppo.
Komachiyo is headbutted unconscious by Ulti.
As Komachiyo was heading to the Live Stage, Page One grabbed on to Komachiyo’s back but Nami and Usopp knocked him off Komachiyo’s back. But then, Komachiyo stopped running when they encountered Big Mom. After a while, Page One chased after them again and just when Komachiyo was about to get chomped by Page One, Big Mom punched Page One.
As Ulti and Big mom argued, Komachiyo took the opportunity to flee, but Ulti caught up and headbutts Komachiyo. She then proceeded to repeatedly kick Komachiyo unconscious.
Hamlet
later carried the unconscious Komachiyo away from the fires.
A week later, Komachiyo joined in the celebration of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's victory.
