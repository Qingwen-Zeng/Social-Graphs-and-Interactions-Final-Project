Appearance
[
]

Gyogyo wears a tank top with the phrase "GREAT MAN" printed on it, trousers with a pair of suspenders, and a cowboy hat.
Personality
[
]
As a child, Gyogyo was once somewhat of a bully, throwing rocks at Kuma because he thought the boy was lying about his age. However, after Kuma used his powers to heal Gyogyo from Ginny's assault, they became friends.
Gyogyo was attracted to Ginny like many of the boys in Sorbet. He was also fiercely loyal to Kuma, starting riots at the kingdom's Castle Town after Kuma was unjustly imprisoned for protesting the enslavement of citizens.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Gyogyo's overall abilities are unknown, but Conney stated that he was quite formidable in a fight, saying that other pirates and sea beasts would run at the sight of his strength. He has been seen fighting with a rope twirled like a lasso, but it is unknown how skilled he is with it.
Despite this, however, he is clearly no match for the strength of the
Blackbeard Pirates
.
History

Past
[
]
Gyogyo grew up in the
Sorbet Kingdom
. As a child, he and another boy threw rocks at
Bartholomew Kuma
because they did not believe the unusually large boy was really nine years old. The boys were subsequently heavily beaten up by
Ginny
. However, Kuma showed compassion towards them and
pushed away their pain
. Afterwards, Gyogyo and the other boy befriended Kuma and Ginny and helped them carry wood to sell it.
25 years ago, Gyogyo was smitten with Ginny and once brought fish to Kuma's church to gift to her. 22 years ago, Gyogyo and other men joined Ginny in an attempt to free Kuma from jail, but the group was defeated and arrested. They were freed when
Monkey D. Dragon
and the
Freedom Fighters
overthrew the corrupt king
Bekori
.
Over 7 years ago, while visiting Kuma in his now light-proofed church, Gyogyo learned that Ginny's daughter,
Bonney
, had started developing
Sapphire Scales
symptoms. He then started looking for
doctors
around the kingdom that could help in identifying and treating it.
6 years ago, Gyogyo witnessed Bonney using her
Toshi Toshi no Mi
for the first time and tried to help her figure out how to control her aging. He also received the news about
Bekori
's possible return and the false propaganda he was spreading about Kuma's reign, complaining that the ousted king was distorting the facts to blame Kuma for his own atrocities.
Gyogyo and others celebrate Bonney's birthday.
3 and a half years ago, Gyogyo welcomed Bonney back to the kingdom after her six-month treatment at
Egghead
.
Half a year later, Gyogyo celebrated Bonney's 9th birthday party alongside her other friends. During this time, Gyogyo would sometimes keep Bonney's company by playing Jenga or having sparring matches with her.
At some point following this, he was asked by
Conney
to accompany Bonney on her escape from the
World Government
's "protection" of her.
After remodelling their fishing ship into a
pirate ship
, Gyogyo and the other fishermen of Sorbet waited for Bonney at a port and quickly set sail when she arrived. Soon after, they witnessed Bonney taking down a pursuing
Alpha
and cheered for her.
