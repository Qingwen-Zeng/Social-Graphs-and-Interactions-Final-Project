Ipponmatsu
is the owner of an
arms shop
in
Loguetown
and
Ipponume
's husband. He was the former owner of both
Sandai Kitetsu
and
Yubashiri
.
Appearance
[
]
He is a short man with black hair that goes to the sides of his head. He has tan skin and wears a blue shirt. His nose is red.
The crest-like piece of hair on his forehead shifts between arcing up to arcing down several times in the chapter.
Personality
[
]
For the most part, he is a stereotypical merchant: cynical, unscrupulous, and—especially according to his wife
Ipponume
—money-grubbing. He has very few qualms about selling weapons to criminals or trying to mislead new customers into uneven bargains, and is usually surly to those he cannot make a profit from.
However, he still holds a genuine passion for
swords
and swordsmanship, and for many years refused to sell
Sandai Kitetsu
for fear that its curse would injure or kill the buyers. After meeting
Roronoa Zoro
, this passion came to the forefront, rekindling his faith in "true" swordsmen.
Relationships
[
]
Ipponume
[
]
Ipponmatsu and his wife.
Ipponmatsu has a good relationship with his wife. He calls her "honey" and "dear" and cleans the bathtub for her. However, Ipponume thinks that he is a "cheapskate".
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
When he first met
Zoro
, he thought that he was an amateur because of the little amount of money he had with him at the time. However, Ipponmatsu was greatly impressed by the swordsman's skill after he tested his luck against the curse of
Sandai Kitetsu
. He even gave Zoro his family heirloom for free. The shop owner believed that he entrusted his dream to Zoro.
Ipponmatsu still thinks highly of Zoro after two years since he now has an enlarged poster of Zoro in his bath.
Marines
[
]
Ipponmatsu strongly dislikes Loguetown's
Marines
, holding them directly responsible for reducing the town's
pirate
population—and with it, much of his shop's customer base. In particular, he has dubbed
Smoker
a "monster", not only for his ruthless competence, but for his
considerable
Devil Fruit
abilities.
He also holds a low opinion of Smoker's main adjunct
Tashigi
, viewing her naïve personality and physical clumsiness as a hazard to both his shop and his business practices. Nevertheless, during her posting in Loguetown, he appears to have been the regular cleaner for her sword
Shigure
.
History

Past
[
]
At some point in the past, Ipponmatsu became the owner of an arms shop in Loguetown. He used to have multiple pirate customers that were looking to enter the Grand Line. However, since Smoker was put in charge of the Marine base on the island, Ipponmatsu barely had any customers.
East Blue Saga

Loguetown Arc
[

At some point, Tashigi brought her sword, Shigure, to Ipponmatsu's arms shop to get it polished. The shop owner accepted the job and later finished polishing the sword.
When he first met Zoro, Ipponmatsu acted polite due to Zoro being his first customer in a long time, but he became dismissive when he discovered that Zoro only had
100,000 on him. After he recognized the
Wado Ichimonji
held by the swordsman, he tried to fool Zoro to sell it for far less than it was worth, but Zoro refused to sell it. He stopped trying when
Tashigi
showed up and ruined his plan. His greedy attitude changed when Zoro tested his luck against the
Sandai Kitetsu
, tossing it up into the air and holding out his arm to see if it would be sliced off. The sword missed Zoro's arm entirely, defying Ipponmatsu's refusal to sell it due to the curse on the blade.
Ipponmatsu was impressed by Zoro's skill, so he gave him both Sandai Kitetsu and
Yubashiri
, his family heirloom and his store's best sword. He told his wife that he was passing on his dream to Zoro.
