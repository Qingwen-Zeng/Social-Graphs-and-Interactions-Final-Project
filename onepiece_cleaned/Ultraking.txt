At some point, Ultraking met and was trusted by
Crocodile
to take charge and run his
Rainbase
casino,
Rain Dinners
. He was given the position of assistant-manager, while the manager position was given to Miss All Sunday.
Arabasta Arc
[
]
When Luffy and his crew barged into his casino, Ultraking ordered the Koala Mercenaries, the casino's security, to apprehend the pirates. After they were defeated, he deeply apologized to Miss All Sunday. She told him to lead the pirates into the VIP Room, which confused Ultraking, but he did so when she said it was Crocodile's orders. He and his staff then led them, along with
Smoker
, to the VIP Room, where they were locked in a cage to drown.
His fate after the casino closed is currently unknown.
