What is the history of the Donquixote Family that Doflamingo descends from?
The Donquixote Family, including Donquixote Doflamingo, was one of the 20 royal families that established the World Government 800 years ago. Doflamingo and his brother, Rosinante, lost their World Noble statuses when their father, Homing, gave up his title, leading to their impoverishment and persecution. Doflamingo then formed the Donquixote Pirates, earning the loyalty of Vergo, Trebol, Diamante, and Pica. They governed Dressrosa until their downfall.

Who was Donquixote Homing and what was his relationship with Doflamingo?
Donquixote Homing, father to Donquixote Doflamingo and Rosinante, was a former World Noble from the Donquixote Family. He left his noble status and Mary Geoise behind to lead a normal life with his family. This choice resulted in two years of torment from civilians who held prejudice against his past. Tragically, Homing was killed by Doflamingo at the tender age of ten.

Appearance
[
]
Doflamingo is very tall (standing at 10' and as a comparison taller than
Kuzan
as shown in their confrontation),
A very lean and muscular man with a six-pack, tan skin (fair in the manga, and blonde hair incredibly short resembles a
pixie cut
. He generally dresses in flamboyant clothes. About his animal theme, the
flamingo
, his clothes are brightly colored, with his large light pink feather coat most distinctly of all. Doflamingo sports a pair of curved, thin white sunglasses, which appear to serve as his eyesight with red lenses. He also walks with an odd, bow-legged waddle (though he does not always walk like this), which is also a reference to his animal theme.
In the manga, he wears a white shirt with red stripes (early open revealing his chest), a green belt, and orange pants with white stripes. He also wears pointed black dress shoes. Originally in the anime, Doflamingo had a red shirt with black stripes, a purple belt, and black pants with red stripes. However, when he reappeared during the events of Sabaody, his color scheme was switched to its manga depiction, except for his glasses. In the manga, he has orange-tinted glasses, while in the anime (pre-timeskip) he has purple-tinted ones. He is also seen often if not always, smiling with his long tongue hanging out,
Two years after the war, Doflamingo's outfit is somewhat less elaborate, wearing a long-sleeved plain, open shirt that has small, dark Jolly Rogers as cufflinks, an orange belt with green ropes, and pink striped pants with white patterns. However, he still wears his trademark sunglasses which have changed from purple to red lenses and dress shoes. Post-Timeskip, he drapes his feathered coat on his shoulders instead of leaving his arms in the sleeves, similar to many high-ranking Marines and pirates alike. He also now wears a golden hoop earring on each ear.
After his defeat by Luffy, Doflamingo wore a horizontally striped prisoner outfit.
Even as a child, Doflamingo spent most of the time wearing sunglasses, though he had not yet acquired his trademark ones. Before leaving
Mary Geoise
, Doflamingo wore spiral sunglasses with dark-brown lenses he wore the typical garb of the Celestial Dragons, and his hair fashioned the same style of his adult self, but also curled upwards typical of the World Nobles. After the family left Mary Geoise, his hair was changed to a neat
bowl cut
and his wardrobe consisted of simple fine clothes: a low-neck button-up shirt with black stripes and a frilled cravat.
However, due to the harsh life on the run from angry citizens, Doflamingo's appearance started to turn more disheveled;
in a
depiction
, his shirt and hair grew messier and unkempt, going barefoot, sitting on a tattered chair near palm trees, smoking a cigarette.
At age 10, after gaining loyalty from his four closest childhood friends, he changed out of his tattered noble clothes for a simpler, yet cleaner, black shirt, and white shorts.
From this point onward, Doflamingo began to look more threatening. He eventually took on the appearance of a mob boss, wearing a black coat like a cloak over a pale lavender shirt with an unbuttoned collar, and bole-colored shorts. His hair took on a spiky appearance, and he replaced his ordinary sunglasses with the trademark pair of spiral-shaped red lenses that he has now.
At age 17, his hair was longer than it is currently, he had two earrings on his left ear, and he sported a pair of goggles that he wore on his forehead. In addition, he also wore sunglasses similar to the ones he wears today, but they had a different temple design and his signature feathered mantle.
At age 25, when Law first came to him requesting membership in the crew, Doflamingo seemed to have done away with the goggles, but otherwise seemed the same in appearance;
he wore a black dress shirt with a red tie and white pants with a bright red design, with his signature mantle over it,
At age 28, during his trip to
Minion Island
he briefly wore a blood-red double-breasted suit with yellow-gold buttons, with matching blood-red dress pants and shoes, a pair of (dark green in the anime, black in the manga) gloves and changed his sunglasses to the ones he wears currently.
By the time he was 31, he had his hair cut down to the current length. Currently, after his defeat at
Dressrosa
, Doflamingo now has
Seastone
shackles on his arms, legs, and entire chest, while chained to the floor of Tsuru's ship, he is also wearing a standard
Impel Down
prison uniform, with a few white bandages on his forehead as well. He was also given a new set of sunglasses.
