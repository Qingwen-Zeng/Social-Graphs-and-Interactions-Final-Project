The Heart Pirates reunite with Law.
After Law arrived at Zou around a month and a week later, the Heart Pirates happily reunited with their captain when he came into the Whale Forest.
That night, the Heart Pirates briefly met and greeted
Monkey D. Luffy
before Law went to have a private conversation with the Straw Hats. The
Guardians
later threw a party for the Straw Hats that lasted throughout the night, and the Heart Pirates joined in.
The next day, the Heart Pirates, some of the Straw Hats,
Kin'emon
,
Kanjuro
, and
Raizo
prepared to depart Zou for
Wano Country
on the
Polar Tang

The Heart Pirates later infiltrated Wano Country. After Law was captured to free
Bepo
,
Shachi
, and
Penguin
, the Heart Pirates gathered in Ebisu Town and discussed their captain's situation.
The crew later reunited with their captain and they entered the battle with the Beasts Pirates on the day of the
Fire Festival
. After rescuing Kin'emon's group, the crew was shocked to hear that
Kaidou
had formed an alliance with
Big Mom
.
After the guards at the torii gates were defeated by the Straw Hats, the Heart Pirates and the
Scabbards
(except Kin'emon and
Denjiro
) traversed to the back of
Onigashima
in the Polar Tang.
When the submarine got close enough, it rose to the surface and Law
teleported
himself, Bepo, Shachi, Penguin, and the Scabbards with them to Onigashima's back entrance. Once they left, the rest of the crew submerged back underwater.
The Heart Pirates rescue Luffy from drowning.
After Kaidou knocked Luffy off of the floating island, the crew aboard the Polar Tang could hear Luffy's voice and located him underwater.
After being rescued and having the water from his lungs squirted out by the Heart Pirates, Luffy eventually woke up and started demanding for meat.
