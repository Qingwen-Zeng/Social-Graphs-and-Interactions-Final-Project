Nefertari D. Lili
was the
queen
of the
Arabasta Kingdom
during the time of the
Void Century
, being one of the
twenty monarchs
credited with the founding of the
World Government
. Unlike the other nineteen monarchs, Lili chose not to become a
World Noble
and move to
Mary Geoise
, but before she could return to her home country, she mysteriously vanished.
Aside from that, little is known about her except that she had a younger brother who succeeded her as ruler of Arabasta.
Lili is the earliest known carrier of the
Will of D.
, being supposedly the main individual responsible for the presence of the
poneglyphs
around the
world
. For this reason, her actions could be considered a major driving force of the overall plot of the series.

A painting of Lili, at Mary Geoise.
Based on her silhouette, and a painting, Lili looked very similar in appearance to two members of the Nefertari Family.
Vivi
, who was born into the family, and also
Titi
who married into it. She wore a dress, a cape and a royal crown on her head.
Personality

Little is known of her personality, but she seemingly chose her own country over the right to rule the entire
world
.
Abilities and Powers

queen regnant
of
Arabasta Kingdom
, Lili had authority over the country's military forces and citizens. She was also part of the extremely influential
First Twenty
who founded the

world
with the other nineteen families, though she ultimately rejected this offer.

Biography
[
]
Lili was the representative of the
Arabasta Kingdom
that took part in the creation of the
World Government
around 800 years ago. As such, she took part in the conflict against the
Great Kingdom
alongside nineteen other nations, which resulted in her side's victory.
However, after the establishment of the World Government proper, Lili chose not to move her
family
to
Mary Geoise
, having not placed a symbolic weapon around the
Empty Throne
, and attempted to return to her homeland. It was allegedly the belief of the World Government that
Queen
Lili went back to her country in safety, but as
King
Cobra
found out, she never returned home. With Lili missing, her younger brother took over as Arabasta's ruler in her stead.
According to
Imu
, Lili's actions led to the
Poneglyphs
to be spread across the
world
, which became the worst possible outcome for the World Government. They wondered whether it was a genuine mistake on Lili's behalf, or that it was part of a greater plan.
Legacy
[
]
In spite of her historical importance, for some reason, Lili did not show up in any Arabastan records post-
Void Century
. Her existence, however, was verified by a letter of her authorship that has been passed down among generations within the
Nefertari Family
. In the letter, Lili encouraged protecting the
Poneglyphs
and bearing the flag of
dawn
against the
world
, signing as "Nefertari D. Lili".
