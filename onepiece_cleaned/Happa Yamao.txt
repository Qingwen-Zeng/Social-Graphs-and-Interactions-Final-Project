Water 7 Arc
[
]
Usopp bought wood and supplies from Happa in order to repair the Going Merry. Happa also gave Usopp some rice balls when he realized that Usopp was hungry. Usopp didn't have enough to pay for all the wood, so he tried to trade it for some of his tools, making Happa wonder if Usopp was a rustic trader. He let Usopp have the extra wood.
