fish-man
and the former 8th division

Whitebeard Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Namur's concept art from the anime.
Namur appears to be a shark
fish-man
. His shark-like teeth stick out of his mouth from his lower jaw, with three small teeth on each side. He also has three pairs of gills on his neck.
He is somewhat short and rotund in shape, and his hair is arranged in spikes pointing upwards, similar to
Gecko Moria
. He has the number "8" tattooed to the left side of his neck to represent the division that he leads. He also wears a white t-shirt with sky blue sleeves with the star logo for the
Criminal
brand (colored orange) on his chest. Due to his legs not being visible in the manga, in the anime he was given standard grey pants held up by a belt. Also in the anime, he is also seen with a gray shark fin protruding from his back, and no shoes.
Personality
[
]
Namur is very loyal to the Whitebeard Pirates and Whitebeard, as he was willing to risk his own life in order to save Ace from execution during the war at Marineford.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the commander of the 8th division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Namur has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. As a fish-man, he is ten times stronger than an average human on land, and twice that in water, although since he is a division commander it can be assumed that he is even stronger than that.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.

Namur's combat capabilities are more portrayed in the anime than in the manga. He is shown as an adept
martial artist
, though whether or not he knows
Fish-Man Karate
is unknown. He was also shown to have extremely strong jaws, much like
Arlong
, to the point where he could even destroy a battle axe with his teeth easily.
