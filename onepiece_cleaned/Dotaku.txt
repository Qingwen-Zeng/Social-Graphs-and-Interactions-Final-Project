Dotaku held a conversation with
Kojuro
and another man regarding the Kouzuki's secret message. He stated that if he were 10 years younger, he would want to fight and asks Kojuro what he would do for weapons considering all but samurai are allowed to carry a katana by law. He also mentions that by banning all dojos,
Orochi
has removed all combat training that could be used as a means for an organized rebellion against him.
He later took part in the raid on
Onigashima
and fought alongside Kojuro. When Kojuro was succumbing to the effects of
Ice Oni
, Dotaku tried to encourage him to hold on to his sanity.
