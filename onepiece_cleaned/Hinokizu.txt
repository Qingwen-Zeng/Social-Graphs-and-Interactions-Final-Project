Laugh Tale
.
Eustass Kid
even went as far as to claim that he "could be the key to the war for
One Piece
", suggesting that without knowing who he is or his whereabouts, no one would be able to find the

, making him invaluable to anyone aiming at claiming it.

, Hinokizu is said to be able to create
ocean vortexes
while sailing which swallow up any
ships
that come too close to him; Laffitte speculated that this may come from a

History
[
]
At some point in his life, Hinokizu received a burn scar on his body. Some time between 2 and 24 years prior to the present day, the
Road Poneglyph
that was once located in the
Sea Forest
near Fish-Man Island went missing, and word eventually began to spread that it was now in Hinokizu's possession. Given this legend was well-known by
Blackbeard
a year ago, it is likely that this occurred many years ago rather than recently.
