Shinobu
is a
kunoichi
from
Wano Country
and a retainer of the
Kouzuki Family
,
having once served in the
Oniwabanshu
of the Kouzuki Shogunate and trained under
Kin'emon
as his protégée.
She is also the younger sister of
Shinosuke
.
She is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Despite her stout silhouette, Shinobu is quite tall, standing at 180 cm.
However, when standing next to other people, she appears considerably shorter than that. As a middle-aged woman, she is considered rather ugly with her broad eyebrows, fat nose, and overall chubby face. She has brown hair tied in pigtails and wears over-the-top makeup, as well as a pink-colored kunoichi attire.
She was very beautiful when she was younger, able to capture the hearts of many of her foes according to
Hanzo
.
20 years ago, she wore a hot-pink, short dress with slits at the sides with a plunging neckline, revealing her cleavage. Her pigtails were much more longer and she wore a light-yellow scarf.
Following her battle against
Ryokugyu
, as a result of her body
being shriveled up
, all the excess fat was removed, causing her to resemble her appearance from 20 years ago. However, she retains her blunt bangs and blush on her cheeks from her older appearance. Her new outfit consists of a short sleeveless kimono with flower patterns, a checkered obi, high-heeled sandals, a scarf and a knee-length cape.
In the
Oni Child Yamato's Golden Harvest Surrogate Pilgrimage
cover story, Shinobu seemingly returned back to her stout appearance.
However, she was shown to still be thin during the seemingly roughly concurrent
Egghead Arc
.
Personality
[
]
Shinobu takes great pride in her former beauty
and she is offended when someone looks down on her beauty and compares her to her younger appearance.
She also seems to panic easily and said that she is
afraid of sharp objects
.
However, she apparently did not have a fear of sharp objects twenty years ago as she did carry a sword and used throwing kunais.
Despite having aged, Shinobu still is extremely vain and confident in her appearance even when she was overweight, constantly trying to seduce people and even strangers and employing a thought about the beauty of older women, as seen when she tried to seduce
Sanji
after they met, much to his horror. unfortunately, whenever she tries to seduce someone, she gets constantly rejected due to her age and labeled as "grandma", much to her annoyance, making her strike her victims' groin as she did with several bathers in a bathhouse. This seductive behavior comes from her youth, where she was known for seducing her enemies with her beauty.
She is extremely serious when it comes to overthrowing Orochi as she became frustrated when Kin'emon's plans began falling apart. When suspecting that the captured
Heart Pirates
were responsible for leaking the plans, she went as far as to say that the captured should be silenced.
In additon, she is sympathetic towards the suffering of Wano citizens who were cruelly oppressed by Orochi, being driven to tears when she recalled how the impoverished people of Ebisu Town were driven by uncontrollable hunger to eat the faulty SMILE fruits given to them by Orochi.
Relationships
[
]
Allies
[
]
Kouzuki Family
[
]
Shinobu is very loyal to the
Kouzuki Family
and she supports
Kin'emon
's efforts to overthrow Orochi. She fought alongside Oden and his allies before they were captured. Shinobu was spared from death, due to Oden claiming not to know her.
The main reason she ceased being
Fukurokuju
's subordinate was because he betrayed Oden.
When the citizens of Wano were insulting Oden during his execution, Shinobu was quick to tell them the truth about the reason for Oden's behavior.
After Oden's death and the disappearance of the Nine Scabbards, Shinobu like many other residents of Wano waited for the Kouzuki Family's return for 20 years, and when they did return, Shinobu happily joined their effort to recruiting allies to take down Kaidou and Orochi.
Kouzuki Momonosuke
[
]
As the next shogun, Shinobu was very protective of the young
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, and prioritized his safety above all else. After failing to stop Kanjuro from taking Momonosuke, Shinobu became more determined to protect him, as she attempted to free him, and then after he was freed, she protected him from every possible threat in Onigashima, and even protected him from Kaidou in a last ditch escape attempt to get off of Onigashima, which ended in success. Momonosuke in turn showed his complete trust in Shinobu, and even asked her to use her devil Fruit ability to age his body by 20 years, in order to become a bigger dragon and fly himself and Luffy back to Onigashima, which she begrudgingly agreed to. After she did this, she tearfully and happily saw Momonosuke as an adult, recalling his resemblance to his father, then watched as he; in his adult Dragon form flew himself and Luffy back to Onigashima.
Yamato
[
]
When Shinobu first met
Yamato
, she was instantly distrustful of his intentions towards helping her and protecting Momonosuke, and began running away from Yamato after he began claiming that he was Kouzuki Oden. Even after Luffy confirmed that Yamato was on their side, she still had her doubts until Yamato bravely protected her and Momonosuke from Sasaki's forces and re-introduced himself as Yamato. From that point onwards Shinobu openly accepted Yamato as an ally, and fought alongside Yamato to protect Momonosuke, even after he revealed to the two of them that Kaidou was his Father. When Yamato decided to draw attention away from the two of them in order for them to escape, Shinbou was grateful for the help and gladly continued her mission of protecting the young shogun.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Shinobu trusts the Straw Hats and she works well with them on multiple occasions. She and Nami even went on a mission together.
Trafalgar D. Water Law
[
]
When Law's crewmates were captured by Orochi's forces, Shinobu became angry from the plan being ruined and suspected Law's crewmates leaking the information. When Shinobu suggested to silence and kill his comrades to prevent an information leak, Law became angry at her and decided to rescue his crewmates himself to prevent Shinobu from killing them and told her that he would not forgive her for doubting his comrades. When Law had not shown up prior to beginning the raid on Onigashima, Shinobu did not care whether he joined the fight or not. Their relationship between each other is strained due to Shinobu's extremist thinking for killing Orochi and would use any means necessary to make sure the plan to kill him succeeds, even if it means silencing allies to prevent an information leak. Due to this, they have a strained relationship.
Enemies
[
]
Kurozumi Orochi
[
]
Because of his tyranny, Shinobu developed immense resentment and hatred for
Orochi
and she tirelessly supports the Kouzuki Family in their efforts to overthrow him.
Her disgust for him increased when seeing him execute
Shimotsuki Yasuie
and his delight in the citizens of Wano being under the effects of
SMILE
.
Fukurokuju
[
]
Shinobu once worked under
Fukurokuju
, but she ceased being his subordinate when he betrayed the Kouzuki Family in favor for Kurozumi Orochi and she hates him for that.
Kurozumi Kanjuro
[
]
Formerly, Shinobu deeply respected
Kanjuro
as one of Oden's closest retainers, respectfully referring to him as Kan-sama. However, Kanjuro was secretly working as a spy for Orochi and jeopardizing the Kouzuki revolution that Shinobu had anticipated for twenty years. Because of her trust in Kanjuro, she never considered the possibility of him being a traitor. Shinobu eventually learned of Kanjuro's true colors after he dropped the charade.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Shinobu is a veteran kunoichi with a high degree of knowledge about stealth, espionage and escape techniques. She possesses excellent reflexes (something that allowed her to save her allies of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
from a direct attack from
Kaidou
) and is agile enough to run on walls.
According to her, she excels in the "Art of Bewitchment"
(
妖艶の術
,
Yōen no Jutsu
?
)
.
Ninjutsu
[
]
Further information:
Ninjutsu
As a veteran kunoichi, Shinobu is highly skilled in ninjutsu, stealth, and infiltration techniques. She easily defeated Hanzo of the Orochi Oniwabanshu
and also snuck into Orochi's castle.
Marksmanship
[
]
Shinobu has shown great skill in shurikenjutsu, being able to make an object ricochet off the ground to strike at Hanzo's groin.
During her youth, she showed remarkable marksmanship with kunai throwing knives, taking out a Beasts Pirate sniper aiming at Oden.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Juku Juku no Mi
Shinobu decays the floor.
Shinobu ate the Juku Juku no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that gives her the ability to make anything she touches rapidly mature and rot. As the residents of Wano are unaware of the existence of Devil Fruits, she calls her power "Juku Juku Enticement Jutsu".
She can use this power to avoid attacks by rotting away a place for her to hide, such as by rotting away the ground to create a sinkhole. She can also decay away anything that might be obstructing her path.
She can also use this power to physically age living beings, though they do not mature mentally. By aging a young ally into adulthood, they become bigger and stronger, and thus more helpful in battle. This action cannot be reversed.
Weapons
[
]
Shinobu carries a katana.
During a battle with the Beasts Pirates twenty years ago, she used throwing kunais.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Shinobu spies on Orochi and Oden.
Shinobu served under the
Kouzuki Family
's ninja squad known as the Kouzuki Oniwabanshu, but when
Kurozumi Orochi
usurped the shogunate 28 years ago, all of the ninja except Shinobu eventually decided to serve him as the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
.
25 years before the present, Shinobu spied on the confrontation between
Kouzuki Oden
and Orochi as Oden unsuccessfully attempted to take down his usurper.
The kunoichi witnessed as Oden made a deal with Orochi to dance naked in the street every week to prevent the shogun from sending 100 kidnapped citizens to his ally
Kaidou
, with the impression that Orochi and Kaidou would build ships to eventually leave
Wano Country
.
Five years later, Oden and his
Nine Red Scabbards
battled Kaidou and the
Beasts Pirates
in
Udon
, and Shinobu joined the battle as their ally. The Beasts Pirates eventually emerged victorious, and Oden claimed to not know Shinobu to allow her to go free.
Shinobu reveals Orochi and Oden's deal.
Oden and the Scabbards were
sentenced to execution by boiling
, and Oden lifted his retainers on a piece of wood while standing in the boiling oil. As the citizens commented derisively about Oden, Shinobu attacked one of them and told them about the deal Oden had made with Orochi.
Fukurokuju
and the Orochi Oniwabanshu then confronted her, and as Orochi decided to have Oden and his servants shot to death instead, Oden threw his retainers away from the execution site. Shinobu then broke free from Fukurokuju and ran away with them as Oden was executed.
Shinobu gave the Scabbards their weapons as they were chased by an army of pursuers.
For the next 20 years, the Kouzuki Family and all its allies were persecuted by Orochi and Kaidou. However, when Oden's son
Kouzuki Momonosuke
and a contingent of the Scabbards led by Kin'emon returned to Wano after being sent
forward in time
, Shinobu joined their effort to recruit allies for a raid on
Onigashima
during the
Fire Festival
to take down Kaidou and Orochi.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Kin'emon summoned Shinobu to the ruins of Oden Castle to train their ally,
Nami
of the
Straw Hat Pirates
, to become a kunoichi.
Kaidou then came to
Kuri
to look for
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Trafalgar Law
and obliterated the alliance's hideout with a
blast of fire breath
,
but Shinobu saved herself and her comrades by using
her Devil Fruit ability
to sink them into the ground.
Shinobu breaks through the ceiling into the banquet hall.
Shinobu took Nami to the
Flower Capital
and guided her in spying on two officials discussing a governmental weapons purchase. However, the two men spotted Nami peeking from the attic and pierced through the floor with a blade, making Shinobu scream in fear. Shinobu then brought out a big kite and glided outside with Nami.
They then infiltrated Orochi Castle in order to protect
Nico Robin
while she looked for information. When Robin was caught by the Orochi Oniwabanshu, she contacted Shinobu and Nami and they went to find her.
As Robin and
Brook
fought the Oniwabanshu in Orochi's banquet hall, Oniwabanshu member
Hanzo
crawled into the attic above and found Shinobu and Nami. Shinobu became enraged when Hanzo recognized her but then second-guessed himself, causing her to strike him in the groin. Shinobu then broke through the floor into the chaotic banquet hall, crashing down onto
one of Orochi's heads
, and she was shocked as she saw the
yakuza
boss
Kyoshiro
cut down the oiran
Komurasaki
for defying Orochi. As Orochi was chasing Robin, Nami struck him with a
thunderbolt
.
Shinobu, Nami, Robin, and Brook managed to escape from Orochi Castle and go to the Northern Cemetery in
Ringo
with
Kanjuro
. Robin and Brook shared the information that they had found, and Nami, Robin, and Shinobu decided to return to the Flower Capital to go to a bathhouse.
When they got to the bathhouse, they talked about Kyoshiro, and Shinobu told the two
Straw Hats
about Wano's former yakuza boss
Hyougoro
.
However,
X Drake
and
Basil Hawkins
then led a platoon of Beasts Pirates into the bathhouse to capture anyone with the crescent moon symbol on their ankle, which the Wano administration had discovered was a symbol of loyalty to the Kouzuki Family. Nami tried to hide behind Shinobu, and when Hawkins tried to get her out in the open he accidentally disrobed her, causing
Sanji
(who was invisible because of his
Raid Suit
) to reveal his presence with a nosebleed. Sanji then flew Shinobu, Nami, and Robin out of the bathhouse, and as they moved through the air he revealed that
Law's crewmates
had been captured.
Sanji took the three women to Ebisu Town, where Shinobu confronted Law, believing that his crewmates had given away the Kouzuki Family's secret call to arms. Despite Law being enraged by the accusation, Shinobu insisted they eliminate his imprisoned comrades instead of rescuing them; however, Kanjuro told her to stop antagonizing their allies. A man named
Tonoyasu
then came in with the call to arms message and offered his help in the final battle;
he referred to Shinobu and Kanjuro with familiarity, but they could not figure out who he was.
The next day, the alliance members found out that Tonoyasu had been captured, and as they watched a broadcast of his impending execution, Shinobu and Kanjuro realized that he was the former daimyo Yasuie.
They raced into the Flower Capital to save him, but he was executed before they could reach him.
They watched as the Ebisu Town citizens laughed in response to his death, and Shinobu revealed that Orochi had put defective
SMILEs
in the townspeople's food supply to force them to smile and laugh at all times.
The Straw Hats then started fighting Orochi's forces to retrieve Yasuie's body, and after the fighting dispersed, Shinobu and Sanji examined the Flower Capital from a roof. The city was under lockdown and wanted posters of the alliance members were posted all over it, but Shinobu noted that the only thing left to do here was rescuing the people with the crescent moons on their ankles who had all been imprisoned in Rasetsu Town.
Shinobu later went to Amigasa Village in Kuri, where she took part in a meeting with the Nine Red Scabbards—save for
Denjiro
and
Nekomamushi
—and the Straw Hats to discuss their strategy for the final battle. There, Kin'emon revealed that in his sacrifice, Yasuie had changed the alliance's meeting place to Tokage Port to circumvent Orochi's discovery of their plot.
Three days later, on the day before the raid, Momonosuke, the Scabbards, and Shinobu departed for Tokage Port, where they planned to meet their allies the next day.
However, when they got to Tokage Port, none of their allies were there.
With no ability to postpone the raid, the seven Scabbards decided to take a usable ship and take on Kaidou by themselves, leaving Momonosuke in Shinobu's care.
Kanjuro's snakes restrain Shinobu.
Kanjuro stayed behind on the coast in secret, sending a drawing clone onto the boat with the other retainers. By the time Kanjuro revealed that he was the one who was leaking information to Orochi, he had tied up Shinobu using snakes.
After Kanjuro fled to Onigashima with Momonosuke in tow, Shinobu was freed and she joined the Scabbards on the
Polar Tang
. She apologized to Kin'emon for allowing Momonosuke to be captured. As the alliance was attacked by a Beasts Pirates ship with long-ranged cannons,
Jinbe
came to aid the rebels.
After the Straw Hats defeated the guards at the torii gates, Shinobu arrived at Onigashima with the rebels. She later joined
Usopp
,
Tony Tony Chopper
, Nami, and
Carrot
inside the
Brachio Tank V
.
The group in the tank and Kin'emon's forces reached the Pleasure Hall owned by
Black Maria
. Shinobu, Nami, and Carrot volunteered to go look for Momonosuke.
After they separated from Kin'emon's forces and the Brachio Tank V, they ran into
Prometheus
and quickly fled from the
homie
as it called
Big Mom
.
While Nami and Carrot were captured, Shinobu was able to sneak away, allowing her to move undetected so she could save Momonosuke.
When she attempted to free Momonosuke,
King
noticed her presence and threw her away. Momonosuke was then rescued by Sanji using his Raid Suit, and he passed Momonosuke off to Shinobu, who then flew off with the boy in tow.
Yamato protects Shinobu and Momonosuke from Sasaki.
After landing, Shinobu was told by Luffy to trust
Yamato
. However, when Yamato identified himself as Oden, Shinobu ran away with Momonosuke instead of accepting Yamato's help.
While running from Yamato, Shinobu and Momonosuke were attacked by
Sasaki
's platoon. Shinobu was wounded protecting Momonosuke, but Yamato stepped in to protect them.
Because of her injuries, Shinobu begged Yamato to protect Momonosuke.
As Yamato continued taking attacks from Sasaki's squad, Shinobu urged Yamato to take Momonosuke and leave her behind.
Franky
(while in the
General Franky
) then arrived with
Hatcha
chasing after him. When trying to attack Franky with his club, Hatcha created a giant hole in the floor, giving Yamato an opportunity to escape with both Shinobu and the boy.
They got out of the
Skull Dome
, but by that time, Kaidou already lifted the entire island above sea level.
They then hid out in the storeroom inside the dome,
where Shinobu listened to the story about Yamato's meeting with
Portgas D. Ace
and revealed that he had retrieved Oden's
logbook
.
Later, a mouse with an eye mask wandered into the storeroom. Yamato caught the mouse and revealed that it was a
cyborg
from
Kaidou's surveillance unit
. Their location was compromised and a group of Beasts Pirates stormed the storehouse. While hiding Momonosuke, Yamato and Shinobu fought their way out.
In the Right Brain Tower, Yamato and Shinobu continued moving as Yamato asked Momonosuke if he was okay. Momonosuke said that he felt disgusted with himself because everyone thought highly of him yet he saw himself as weak and foolish. Shinobu denied this and called him brave, but Momonosuke refuted this claim and transformed into his dragon form at the same time, which surprised the two.
After Momonosuke returned to his human form, he told them that Luffy was weak but still fighting Kaidou, and Shinobu was shocked at how he knew that.
After Shinobu contacted Kin'emon, she and Momonsuke hid in the crawlspace between the first and second floors, while Yamato left to act as a decoy. Momonosuke began reading his father's logbook, at which Shinobu peeked.
When Momonosuke suddenly had a headache, Shinobu was in shock at Momonosuke's situation. They were later found and regrouped with both Kin'emon and Kikunoju who were just as in shock about Momonosuke's current headache as Shinobu was. Unbeknownst to anyone, Kanjuro also found Momonosuke and Shinobu and once again used his Oden imitation to trick both Shinobu and Momonosuke, before they were both informed by Kin'emon and Kikunojo that this was a fraud and Kanjuro found them. However, Kanjuro was nonetheless able to stab Kikunojo in his disguise, much to Shinobu's shock. Making things worse, soon after Kin'emon struck down Kanjuro, Kaidou appeared in front of all three, attempting to smash both Shinobu and Momonosuke, had it not been for Kin'emon's intervention, who asked Shinobu to take both her and Momonosuke to a safe place.
She was still carrying Momonosuke when he, via a Mary, transmitted Luffy's message to everybody on Onigashima. They later ended up stuck on the roof, where they were found by Kaidou who once again tried to settle his unfinished business with them. As she saw no other way out, Shinobu used her Devil Fruit powers to let the ground beneath them crumble, sending them both downward and off Onigashima
When Luffy was saved by the Heart Pirates, Momonosuke talked in private to Shinobu, asking her to use her powers to make him an adult, to which she replied this would leave him mentally as a child and only alter him physically and urged him not to ask something like this from her.
Although she feared the consequences, she still fulfilled his wish, using her powers to turn Momonosuke into an adult. His resemblance to his father left her in tears.
She later watched Luffy and Momonosuke depart towards Onigashima.
After Luffy defeated Kaidou, Momonosuke safely landed Onigashima. When a volcano erupted where Onigashima once sat, Momonosuke flew with his sister and retainers into the Flower Capital in order to calm the panicking citizens. As the citizens marveled at the return of the Nine Red Scabbards, Denjiro then announced Momonosuke as the new Shogun of Wano Country. After broadcasting a speech to the whole country, Momonosuke, along with his retainers, entered the shogun's castle.
Shinobu and the Scabbards ready to protect Luffy from Ryokugyu.
A week later, after Luffy and Zoro finally awoke, Shinobu joined the other women in a bath
and later enjoyed the ongoing festivities in the Flower Capital.
When the Kouzuki Retainers noticed
Admiral
Ryokugyu
's approach, several of them, including Shinobu, went out to stop him from entering the Flower Capital. Using
his Devil Fruit powers
, Ryokugyu attacked the samurai and announced his intent to go after Luffy. They were joined by Yamato and Momonosuke, and the retainers became distressed as Ryokugyu restrained Momonosuke.
During the battle Ryokugyu restrained Shinobu and Raizo and drained them of their moisture, but was forced to retreat due to
Shanks
'
Haki
.
Shinobu and Raizo were taken back to the Flower Capital and treated by the mink doctors. Shinobu made a full recovery but lost an excess of body fat, causing her to resemble her appearance from 20 years ago.
During this time, she had also taken in
Tama
as a kunoichi apprentice. Later she rejoined her comrades alongside Yamato when Momonosuke took his position as the new Shogun of Wano.
