Heracles
is a strange warrior that used to reside in the Greenstone forest in the
Boin Archipelago
. He trained
Usopp
in the use of
Pop Greens
for two years.
Appearance
[
]
Heracles is dressed in a beetle-stylized armor that looks like a hero costume with a mask that covers his face, a mantle, and a purple cape. He has a round-shaped body with relatively thin arms and legs.
Personality
[
]
He has an odd habit of adding "n" to people's names (a Japanese quirk often done to show friendship), as well as at the end of sentences (in Japanese). For example, he called Usopp
(
ウソップ
,
Usoppu
?
)
"Usoppun"
(
ウソップン
,
Usoppun
?
)
, and he himself is Heraclesun
(
ヘラクレスン
,
Herakuresun
?
)
. He also has a habit of repeatedly introducing himself. Heracles has a usual laid-back attitude, but is quick to react when he senses dangers. He also seems to be an easy target for flattery and compliments.
Relationships
[
]
Usopp
[
]
The two share a very positive relationship as Heracles is very friendly towards
Usopp
and was quick to help him when he first arrived on
Boin Archipelago
.
He seems to care for Usopp's well-being as he saved him from being eaten multiple times. He was concerned over Usopp's rapid weight gain and was pleased to hear he was determined to lose the weight after hearing the news about
Luffy
. He was surprised by Usopp's new found resolve to become stronger and quickly agreed to teach him all he knew about the plants and animals that live on the island.
Due to Usopp's timid and weak nature pre-time skip, Heracles played a big role in improving Usopp's battle capabilities and becoming a more talented
sniper
. He aided Usopp and his
crew
's escape from
Sabaody Archipelago
after having helped him arrive on the island to be reunited with his crew.

During Kuma's quest to find a cure for his adopted daughter
Jewelry Bonney
's
Sapphire Scales
illness, he and Heracles became acquainted.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Heracles' main style of combat involves the usage of a spear and explosives. His attacks are apparently very fast. Though round in appearance, he is fit and strong which is evident from the way he defeated a giant beetle and man-eating plant with a single kick.
He also has a great amount of knowledge about the different plants and animals of the island where he lives and his armor gives him additional defense. He keeps a stock of Pop Greens in his belt. He also seems to be able to control giant beetles.
Despite his incredible power and combat prowess, he has a tendency to be uncoordinated (having falling headfirst off a vine he was swinging off) and rather nonchalant about his rather painful methods; a spear he threw to kill a giant beetle almost skewered Usopp in the head, and to save Usopp from a carnivorous sunflower, he punched Usopp to create a projectile that defeated the plant.

Amazon Lily Arc
[
]
After Usopp was sent to
Boin Archipelago
by
Bartholomew Kuma
, Heracles rescued him from a giant beetle. Usopp, though thankful of Heracles, looked in shock at his proposal to eat the giant beetle. While Usopp was distracted, a giant man-eating plant tried to devour him, but Heracles saved him once again. Heracles informed Usopp to be more careful if he wanted to keep his life and possessions.
Straw Hat's Separation Serial
[
]
Heracles was later seen alongside Usopp eating ramen in a part of the large forest consisting entirely of edible food (such as "spaghetti plants", "ham fruits", and "chocolate rocks") while Usopp hungrily looked at the food around him, which led the
Straw Hat
sniper
to become fat, with Heracles emitting a gasp and looking at him in shock.
Post-War Arc
[
]
When a
News Coo
dropped a
newspaper
down to the Archipelago, Usopp learned about the events of the
Whitebeard War
and tried desperately to get off the island to help his ailing friend and
captain
Monkey D. Luffy
to get over the trauma of
his brother
's death. Heracles tried to stop Usopp from fighting a giant beetle, but failed as Usopp attempted to get past it. When Usopp lost, Heracles informed him that more and more dangerous creatures will appear as he tried to go away from the center of the island. Usopp did not listen and took off again regardless of Heracles' warnings. Heracles told Usopp that escaping the island was impossible because of the giant creatures that get attracted to the aroma of the island. He noticed that the island was beginning to move and warned Usopp to cling to something as the island was revealed to be a large carnivorous plant called the Stomach Baron. The island moved again and Heracles, fortunately, saved Usopp from falling into the island's mouth.
Heracles then questioned Usopp for his sudden change of behavior since reading the newspaper, to which Usopp answered by saying that Luffy was in pain after losing his brother and that he needed to be there for Luffy. While Usopp was reading the article about Luffy going back to Marineford, Heracles asked him what he was reading then.
Some time later, Heracles and Usopp were escaping from the dangerous creatures on the island as they did everyday. Heracles realized the hard determination Usopp gained after reading the newspaper, which made him question what the pirate read. Usopp told Heracles about the message from Luffy and then he asked Heracles to train him, saying that he could learn a lot of things from Heracles, like fighting and sniping abilities. Usopp called him "Amazing Warrior", "Sensei", and then remarking that his name was pretty cool. With all these comments, Heracles got excited and agreed to train Usopp, beginning with the different types of plants there are on the island and their different uses in battle, specifically
Pop Green
and their energy and growth properties. He trained Usopp in the use of Pop Greens for two years until the time came for the latter to reunite with his crewmates.

Manga and Anime Differences
[
]
The anime expands on Usopp's and Heracles' adventures on the Boin Archipelago, as well as bringing up facts that are not revealed in the manga until much later after the war.
When Usopp and Heracles first met, the method in which Heracles dispatched the man-eating plants were different. In the anime, Heracles threw a ball into the plants mouth, but in the manga, he threw something that wrapped vines around the plant, which was most likely the foreshadowing of the
Pop Greens
.
The expansion of their escapade starts as Usopp is shown to be running away from a giant sunflower plant with Heracles watching on. Usopp asks Heracles to help him against the giant sunflower plant, which is trying to eat him alive. Heracles manages to save Usopp and tells him to build up stamina as he is weaker than ants and worms on that island. Usopp denies this at first, but later agrees with Heracles when he sees a giant ant and worm. Heracles easily beats both the ant and the worm and asks Usopp if he wants to eat them. Usopp in his traditional fashion looks in utter disbelief at Heracles's proposal. He then informs Heracles that he is hungry and wants to eat something edible. Heracles takes him to a place where items like ramen, spaghetti, ham and chocolates are available in abundance. Usopp starts to gulp down the items and is told by Heracles to also work out to build stamina as eating alone will not do it.
Later, Heracles loses sight of Usopp, who is busy eating out all the delicacies available on the island. When he finds him, Usopp has already become fat. He tells Usopp to lose some calories when all of a sudden the island starts to move and eats everything on it. Both Usopp and Heracles try to escape, with Heracles catching hold of a branch and tries to catch Usopp, but Usopp is too heavy for Heracles to hold on to. He waves his goodbyes to Usopp, believing it is inevitable that Usopp will be eaten, but Usopp catches a ramen branch and eats it to climb up and escape.
Afterward, Heracles finds Usopp and tells him that fat things will definitely be eaten on the Boin Archipelago, which is in truth a group of giant carnivorous plants. He also informs him that it is impossible to escape the island.
