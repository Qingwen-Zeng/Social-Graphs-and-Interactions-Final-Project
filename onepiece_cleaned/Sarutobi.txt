History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
While
O-Robi
was sneaking around
Orochi Castle
, Sarutobi and the rest of the Orochi Oniwabanshu silently appeared behind her.
The group moved to restrain her, but then discovered that this Robin was actually a
body double
, and so
Fukurokuju
sent them to the banquet hall to locate the real Robin.
Daikoku
eventually spotted Robin and the Oniwabanshu confronted her, but she and her accomplices were able to escape.
Brook scares Sarutobi and other members of the Orochi Oniwabanshu.
After
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution, the Orochi Oniwabanshu arrived to help fight off the
Straw Hat Pirates
. However, Sarutobi,
Chome
, and
Bishamon
were quickly scared away by
Brook
's disembodied spirit, which they mistook for the
Gashadokuro
.
Several days later, the
Fire Festival
arrived and the Oniwabanshu accompanied
Kurozumi Orochi
to
Onigashima
to celebrate with the
Beasts Pirates
.
However,
Kaidou
seemingly killed Orochi during the festivities as part of his plot to assume full control over Wano, and Fukurokuju pledged the Oniwabanshu's allegiance to the
Emperor
and his crew.
