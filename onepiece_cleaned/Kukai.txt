Making their Mark
[
]
Kukai joined the Spade Pirates and traveled with Ace as he made a name for himself. He helped fight off a group of bounty hunters, and, when
Isuka
infiltrated the crew's ship, he surrounded the
Marine
Ensign alongside his crewmates. However, she easily fended them off. After the confrontation, the crew reached
Sabaody Archipelago
. While they waited for their ship to be
coated
, Kukai and his crewmates explored the island and secretly read Deuce's adventure diary. They laughed at his poor writing skills, leading Deuce to exclude their names from the diary.
At one point, the Spade Pirates were shipwrecked in
Wano Country
. The people from Amigasa Village were starving to death, so they tied the entire crew and stole all their food. The crew watched the villagers finish their meal and then broke out. Instead of attacking, Ace asked the villagers where he could get them dessert. They stayed in Amigasa Village for a few weeks and became good friends with
Tama
