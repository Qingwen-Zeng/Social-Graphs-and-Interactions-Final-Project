Saldeath
is one of the Chief Guards of
Impel Down
. He is the commander of the
Blue Gorillas
.
Due to his actions, he is a major antagonist in the
Impel Down Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
His appearance looks to be that of a little devil or imp in a white suit with a yellow shirt underneath, a black tie and he is also seen wearing yellow gloves. He wears a white sun hat with two horns coming out of it bearing the Blugori's skull design in between them and, like
Magellan
and
Hannyabal
, he has bat wings growing out from his back. Though it can be difficult to see for his hat, he does not seem to have any outer ears.
After the two year timeskip, he has grown much taller while retaining his usual outfit, now fitted for his increase in size. His facial appearance has not changed much from two years previously however.
As a child, he had a shaved head. He sported a white long sleeve button up shirt with a black stripe near the stomach. He also had black pants and white shoes.
Personality
[
]
Saldeath is a calm and level-headed person who does not appear to be nearly brutal compared to the Blue Gorillas under his command, even going as far as telling
Luffy
,
Buggy
, and
Galdino
that they should be thankful as they were captured by him, before the trio can proceed deeper down to
Level 4
where the four
Jailer Beasts
are stationed (though he may have been sarcastic at the time). Nevertheless, he takes the position bestowed upon him in
Impel Down
very seriously; he also tends to easily be annoyed by Luffy when he mistakes him for a monkey.
As a child he used to order his dog to punish those whom he considered to be criminals.
Abilities and Powers

Saldeath using his pitchfork as a flute to control the Blue Gorillas.

History
[

Summit War Saga
[
]
Impel Down Arc
[
]
Saldeath headed up the trap to capture
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Buggy
, and
Galdino
on level 3 of
Impel Down
. However, the trap was thwarted due to also catching the
Sphinx
that had fallen down to the level with them. It woke up and tore the
seastone
net apart freeing the captured
pirates
. Saldeath then rallied his men to go after Luffy.
When the Sphinx and
Blue Gorillas
proved ineffective against Luffy and
Bentham
,
Saldeath took the Blue Gorillas to deal with the prisoner riot on Level 2.
After Luffy's capture, Saldeath subdued all the rioters, but had yet to retrieve all the keys.
After Luffy,
Ivankov
,
Inazuma
,
Crocodile
, and
Jinbe
escaped from Level 6, Saldeath was ordered to go to Level 4 by
Hannyabal
. Once there he ordered the Blue Gorillas to attack Ivankov, but they were all defeated with a single blow. He is not seen again afterwards.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Due to the way his name is pronounced in Japanese, it sounds like "Saru Desu"
(
猿です
?
)
meaning "I am a Monkey"; which is what Luffy thought he said when he introduced himself and Luffy noted that he did not look like one. In the Funimation dub, Luffy thought he said "Salt Breath" and "Sardine Head".
