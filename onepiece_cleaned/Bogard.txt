Bogard
is a
Marine Headquarters
officer
and the right hand man of
Vice Admiral
Monkey D. Garp
.
Appearance
[
]
Bogard is a tall man, roughly half a head higher than Monkey D. Garp who is just a bit shorter than Kuzan. He has a short hair. He wears a marine coat, which is draped over his shoulders. He wears a matching beige suit and hat, with the hat covering his eyes in a shadow.
He has his katana on his left hip, attached to his belt with a brown strap. The sword has a grey-wrapped hilt, a golden rounded-cross shaped tsuba and a deep green sheath.
Bogard seems to wear an apparently perpetual scowl on his face due to the corners of his mouth always pointing downwards, even as a young marine, emphasizing his air of seriousness. On the rare occasions he smiles, it appears more like a smirk.
Bogard's appearance does not seem to have changed much at all over the last 38 years, with him still looking almost identical to how he does in the present day.
Personality
[
]
Bogard appears to be loyal to Garp, as he has been seen multiple times throughout the series at the vice admiral's side, and is notably much quieter than his superior, only speaking when absolutely needed. Bogard seems to enjoy smoking the kiseru pipe, doing so during Garp's test of Koby and Helmeppo, underscoring his air of absolute calm.
Abilities and Powers
[
]

Bogard is a highly capable and experienced Marine, having supported
Monkey D. Garp
since at least the time of the
Rocks Pirates
and having survived the
God Valley Incident
.
While his
marine rank
remains unknown, it is probably higher than Lieutenant, since he wears a "Justice" coat and a suit underneath.
Bogard seems to be skilled in using a
sword
, as his first reaction to Morgan breaking free and attacking Garp was reaching for his katana, to strike immediately.
Also he was able to cut up Koby's guns into small pieces without hurting him in mere seconds.
Later, he was seen training
Koby
and
Helmeppo
, using only one hand (and his less dominant at that) to defend himself against a total of three swords.
Given that his sword is carried on the left and, when Morgan attacked Garp, he used his right to reach for it, Bogard is presumably mostly right-handed.
History

Past
[
]
Bogard arrives on God Valley alongside Garp.
Thirty-eight years ago, Bogard was already a colleague of
Monkey D. Garp
and accompanied him and other marines at the island of
God Valley
to do
battle
with the
Roger Pirates
and
Rocks Pirates
that were wreaking havoc.
Bogard and Garp in Kong's office during the battle of the Edd War.
Twenty seven years ago, Bogard was in
Kong
's office when
Monkey D. Garp
was asked again to accept the rank of
admiral
. When the
Marines
learned that the
Roger Pirates
and the
Golden Lion Pirates
were about to battle each other in the
Edd War
, Garp decided to end the meeting and turned down another promotion, even though Kong did not agree and ordered him to stay. Bogard then nodded at the fleet admiral and left the office with Garp, who was willing to head for the
New World
in order to defeat
Gol D. Roger
. Bogard then followed Garp aboard
Sengoku
's ship as the matter of
Shiki
had been entrusted to Sengoku.
East Blue Saga
[
]
Diary of Koby-Meppo
[
]
Bogard accompanied Garp during his mission to transport a prisoner, the former Marine captain
Morgan
, to be prosecuted.
When Morgan attacked Garp, Bogard reached for his sword, but stood down when Morgan took
Helmeppo
hostage.
As Morgan was escaping with Helmeppo on a small boat, Bogard ordered Marine soldiers to fire a cannon at the vessel.
Koby
attempted to obstruct the attack by standing in front of the cannon while holding pistols in his hands, but Bogard quickly used his swordsmanship to slice the guns into pieces much to Koby's shock.
When Garp announced his intention to take the Koby and Helmeppo with him to
Marine Headquarters
, Bogard and the other Marines were surprised.
Later at Marine Headquarters, Bogard trained Koby and Helmeppo in swordsmanship under Garp's supervision.
Water 7 Saga
[

Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Bogard at Water 7 with Garp, Koby, and Helmeppo.
Bogard was present at
Water 7
alongside Koby and Helmeppo in the group of Marines led Garp, while they visited the
Straw Hat Pirates
. When
Roronoa Zoro
arrived and started attacking the Marines, Bogard recognized him as the "Pirate Hunter" with a bounty on his head.
When Garp explained that he will not capture Luffy because he is his grandson, Bogard criticized his excuse and told him to just report that the Straw Hats "got away".
He was on Garp's ship when the vice admiral complained about
Sengoku
forcing them to go after Luffy.
Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
Two years later, Bogard was aboard Garp's battleship during
SWORD
's raid on
Hachinosu
.
Adaptation Differences
[
]
His name was revealed in the
Episode 68
credits, and has also been used on the official
One Piece
website
, in the
live-action series
, and in various spin-off series.
However, it has yet to be used in the manga proper, the
SBS
, or the
databooks
.
In the anime version of the
Diary of Koby-Meppo
, Bogard was never seen cutting Koby's guns as Koby did not carry any.
His role is expanded in the live-action series with the addition of Garp's storyline, accompanying Garp as his right-hand man across the
East Blue
in pursuit of the
Straw Hat Pirates
. Before the beginning of the story, he has also been investigating
Baroque Works
together with Garp.
