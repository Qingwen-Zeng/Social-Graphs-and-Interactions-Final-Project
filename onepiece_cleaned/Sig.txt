Crew Strength
[
]
Befitting a crew consisting of giants, the Giant Warrior Pirates are a very powerful crew. Their arrival at
Egghead
was met with great shock by the enormous
Marine
fleet present, who failed to even delay the Giant Warrior Pirates' arrival as they cut through several of their
battleships
.
Over 100 years ago, before their disbandment, the Giant Warrior Pirates were particularly infamous, and were known as having terrorized the world. Their strength was legendary, and was known even 100 years later.
The crew's infamy and legendary status was even enough to convince
Hajrudin
and four other giants to found the
New Giant Warrior Pirates
in an attempt to revive the crew.

The
Great Magni
(

)
was a ship that was in use by the crew at the time when
Jarul
and
Jorul
were the captains.
It has not been seen and its whereabouts are unknown. The name "Magni" is likely a reference to one of the sons of the Norse god Thor,
Magni.

The Great Eirik.
The Great Eirik
is a giant longboat in use by the crew from the time when
Dorry
and
Brogy
were the captains. It was the Giant Warrior Pirates' final ship when the captains began their duel and effectively disbanded the crew over 100 years ago.
Upon the crew being reactivated, they returned to using the Great Eirik as their main ship.

The crew rampaging.
Over 102 years ago, the crew was once commanded by
Jarul
and
Jorul
. The two built a great reputation and were known as heroes of the giants. Eventually, they relinquished their position and
Dorry
and
Brogy
took over as captains.
One day Dorry and Brogy hunted down and killed two
Sea Kings
, which proved to be of equal size.
Yuki
, a little girl, asked them which Sea King was bigger, leading to an argument between the leaders.
Sister Carmel saving the crew from execution.
The rest of the crew left the captains to fight it out on
Little Garden
, but were hunted down and captured by the
World Government
and sentenced to be executed. However, during their execution at
Marineford
, a human named
Sister Carmel
intervened, claiming that killing the crew would start a war between giants and humans. The pirates were granted a stay of execution and returned to Elbaph.
After fifty years,
Oimo
and
Kashii
tried to return for them but were captured by the
Marines
and tricked into the service of the World Government.

Oimo and Kashii headed to Elbaph.
They later returned to Little Garden and convinced their captains to pause their duel and return to Elbaph for new
weapons
, seeing that their old ones had been destroyed.
Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
When
Shanks
and the
Red Hair Pirates
arrived, the Giant Warrior Pirates agreed to aid them in battle, and the two captains participated in destroying the
Victoria Punk
.
The Giant Warrior Pirates arrive at Egghead.
The next day, during the
Egghead Incident
, the Giant Warrior Pirates heard about the
Straw Hat Pirates
being under seige by the
Marines
at Egghead.
Hajrudin
, being a representative of the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
, wanted to go rescue them, but they convinced him to let them go in his place.
By the time they arrived, the
Marines
were conducting a
Buster Call
on the island. As Dorry and Brogy lead the charge, the Giant Warrior Pirates obliterated part of the blockade around Egghead, proclaiming they came to help Luffy.
After landing on the island, Dorry and Brogy continued to charge while ordering Oimo and Kashii to lead the assault around the sides of the island, and to sink any Marine ships that they spotted.
Dorry and Brogy would go on to assist Luffy's friends, saving
Jewelry Bonney
, and having their crewmates take
Franky
and
Bartholomew Kuma
back to their ship.
In the meantime, their crewmates would continue to fight off the Marines. After arriving at Luffy's location, the two swiftly decapitated the
Elder
Shepherd Ju Peter
, and had a quick reunion with Luffy.
After sharing a few words and signaling a retreat, Dorry and Brogy were confronted by
Topman Warcury
and
Jaygarcia Saturn
, who both attempted an attack on the group, but were repelled successfully.
Despite their success in fighting off the Elders, none of them stayed down, resulting in Dorry and Brogy deciding on running rather than fighting further. This was met with swift resistance by the Elders, who attempted to chase the group down and stop their escape. While this occurred,
Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro
arrived at the Giant's ship, cutting down a crewmember in the process.
The Giant Warrior Pirates take on the Marines.
Nusjuro's attack would be thwarted by the arrival of Oimo and Kashii, holding back the Elder and keeping him from injuring their friends any further.
Eventually, Nusjuro abandoned his attack on the crew and fled elsewhere to take care of more important matters.
While the giants were distracted, however, the Marines were able to sail their own ships around that of the giant crew's, resulting in a fierce battle in the area. Over the course of this battle, a laser would blow a hole in the hull of the ship, and Kashii would be injured by
Vice Admiral
Doll
. During this time, as a result of more important matters, the other Elders would abandon chasing Luffy, Dorry, and Brogy, resulting in the three being free to make their escape, jumping onto the ship just as it began to depart.
Despite successfully repelling the Marines (with some help from allies), the crew was still under attack, now from Marcus Mars, one of the Elders. Mars used his abilities to chase the giants out onto the ocean, flying above and firing energy beams at them. The energy beams were successfully blocked by a few crewmembers, but ended up catching the ship on fire in the process. While this occurred, Mars declared that none of them would be allowed to leave Egghead alive. To the luck of the crew, Luffy and Bonney used their own abilities to transform into Nika, allowing them to assist in the defense.
Luffy and his crew quickly handled Mars, blasting him far away. At the same time, the giants moved to extinguish the fires caused by him on the ship.
Despite the arrival of the
Iron Giant
to assist, the crew was still bogged down with trouble as Saturn suddenly leaped onto their ship, grabbing a tight hold of it using his legs.
Many of the giants blocked Saturn's attempts on their lives, struggling. Fortunately, Luffy and Bonney came together to attack him, blasting Saturn right back off of the boat.
The Giant Warrior Pirates and Straw Hats flee Egghead.
The giants' relief was cut short once more as the Elders refused to let up. Even with the Iron Giant doing its best to hold them back, Nusjuro and Peter slipped by, with Peter in particular preparing to crush their ship using his large body. At the last possible moment, the Iron Giant undid a knot somewhere on its body, resulting in a massive burst of
Joy Boy
's
Haki
being exerted from its body. The Haki forced most of the Elders back to
Mary Geoise
, knocked out all of the Marines, and made escape from Egghead an easy task.
The giant crew as a whole was confused by what had occurred, but in the end elected to ignore it and take the chance they had been given. The giants and Straw Hats both sailed away from Egghead, partying together as they did so.
Elbaph Arc
[
]
On their way to Elbaph, the Giant Warrior Pirates partied with the Straw Hats and got heavily drunk. Later, while everyone was sleeping, the
Thousand Sunny
drifted away from the Great Eirik with more than half its crew on board.
The giants spent the next two days searching for it with the remaining Straw Hats, but ended up calling off the search upon finding no trace of it, and no proof that it had sunk, so they assumed their allies had made their way to Elbaph on their own. It was also then that Dorry and Brogy learnt about their new bounties, and told their Straw Hat guests about Elbaph's current political conflict regarding prince
Loki
.
