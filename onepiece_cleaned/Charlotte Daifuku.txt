and

He is also an
officer
of the
Big Mom Pirates
and serves as
Totto Land
's
Minister of Beans
(
豆大臣
,
Mame Daijin
?
)
, governing over
Poripori Island
.
Due to his actions and role, he is a major antagonist in the
Whole Cake Island Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Daifuku is an extremely tall and broad man with a proportionally small shaved head with short blonde hair, and some wrinkles on his face, as well as a small mustache.
His eyes are yellow, and he often wears a hard-faced expression.
He wears a dark blue-colored coat with very large, blue and white striped shoulder-pads that is lined with fur on the inside and around the base, and a yellow cape hangs from his shoulders. His hands are covered in orange gloves, and he wears boots of the same tone. He also wears hooped earrings and a thick belt with a depiction of a genie's lamp on it around his waist.
As a child, Daifuku had a shaved head with short gray hair. He wore a tank top and navy blue pants.
Personality
[
]
Daifuku hits his sister Pudding after she fails her task.
Daifuku is very abrasive and violent, intent on taking down his enemies as quickly as possible and becoming extremely angry if they elude him. He also seems to have little regard for his crew while he is focused on a target, as he allowed his genie to destroy many of his own fleet's ships while pursuing
Carrot
.
He is not above striking and verbally abusing people whom he thinks are failing or getting in the way, even if they are his own family, as he hit his sister
Pudding
after she failed to kill
Sanji
and called her useless.
Daifuku seems to believe that strength matters in the crew as he stated that Katakuri should be leader if Big Mom meets her unforeseen demise.
Daifuku is confident in his Devil Fruit. When Pudding failed to kill Sanji, he took it upon himself to eliminate him with his genie.
This was shown again when he decided to take it upon himself to sink the Thousand Sunny.
However, he happens to underestimate his opponents, as he did not count on Carrot's Sulong form.
In spite of his abrasiveness and cruelty, Daifuku does care for his family and, by extension, Totto Land, as he become shocked when Big Mom had another craving illness and expressed concern about stopping her rampage after Streusen got injured during the collapse of the Whole Cake Chateau. He also got along with his brothers, Oven and Katakuri, and he never scorned Katakuri for his eel-like mouth.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Daifuku is very loyal to
his mother
, and participated in her plot to assassinate the
Vinsmoke Family
and also confronted the Sanji Retrieval Team after they crashed the
wedding
. He even accompanied his mother to Kaidou's territory at Wano Country for revenge against the Straw Hats.
Charlotte Pudding
[
]
Daifuku is disappointed in his younger half-sister
Pudding
as he called her a "useless good for nothing" due to her failure to kill
Sanji
and even slapped her away to confront Sanji himself.
Despite that, Daifuku did not object when Pudding volunteered to make a new wedding cake for Big Mom.
Charlotte Katakuri
[
]
Daifuku gets along well with his older brother and fellow triplet
Katakuri
. After the
Straw Hat Pirates
,
Fire Tank Pirates
and the
Vinsmoke Family
got away, Daifuku and Katakuri collaborated to pursue them.
Both were shown to get along during their childhood, eating donuts together and Daifuku was amused by Katakuri's donut gorging habits. Daifuku was also aware of Katakuri’s split mouth and never scorned him for it. Daifuku even said that Katakuri should be captain of the Big Mom Pirates if anything happens to Big Mom, showing respect for Katakuri's capabilities.
Charlotte Perospero
[
]
Daifuku gets along well with his eldest half-sibling and older half-brother. However,
Perospero
is not above insulting Daifuku for letting an enemy get the better of him and letting them escape while calling him useless. They also argued over who should lead the crew if anything happens to Big Mom with Perospero claiming that the eldest sibling should be the leader.
Crew
[
]
As one of the high-ranking members of the Big Mom Pirates and a son of the Charlotte Family, Daifuku is well respected in the crew. However, he cares little to none of the well-being of his crew, as he did not hesitate to destroy his own fleet in his reckless pursuit of Carrot while killing several of his own subordinates without hesitation.
Enemies
[
]
Fire Tank Pirates
[
]
They once served under Big Mom's crew and were seemingly loyal. However, when Bege revealed his treachery by attempting to kill Big Mom, the
Fire Tank Pirates
became enemies of Daifuku and his family.
Sanji Retrieval Team
[
]
Daifuku is an enemy of the
Sanji Retrieval Team
as he attempted to kill
Sanji
in
Pudding
's place.
He especially became an enemy of Sanji's when he smacked away Pudding, which enraged Sanji due to his stance on men assaulting women. When Sanji was attempting to save
his family
, Daifuku pinned him down before he could reach them but failed to keep him down when Big Mom screamed, allowing Sanji to free his family.
When
Carrot
attempted to retreat to
"Big Father"
, Daifuku detained her only for Yonji to free her.
After the Straw Hat Pirates and their allies escaped, Daifuku formed three pursuit teams to chase them down.
When pursuing them on the sea, Daifuku was ready to ambush them but was not prepared for Carrot entering her Sulong form and attacking his fleet.
While enraged at Carrot's actions, he tried attacking her with his genie, but it instead destroyed several of the ships in his fleet.
Upon encountering the Retrieval Team again, Daifuku continued his vendetta against Carrot, summoning the now larger Genie to attack her on the Sunny's mast, but Sanji blocked the genie's strike with a kick. Daifuku was angered when the crew managed to elude him and escape
Totto Land
.
Vinsmoke Family
[
]
As part of
his mother
's plot to assassinate the
Vinsmoke Family
, Daifuku became their enemy. After
Pudding
failed to kill
Sanji
, Daifuku decided to kill Sanji himself.
As Daifuku was about to kill
Carrot
,
Yonji
slammed his genie to the ground to free her.
As the Vinsmokes fought the

Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Daifuku attended Big Mom's
Tea Party
and wedding ceremony for
Charlotte Pudding
and
Sanji
.
He and some of
his siblings
sat a table directly behind the
Vinsmoke Family
ready to assassinate them when the time was right.
After
Monkey D. Luffy
started causing chaos at the wedding venue, Daifuku witnessed
Jinbe
officially resigning from the
Big Mom Pirates
.
Daifuku brings out his genie to attack Sanji.
After the wedding cake collapsed and
Brook
destroyed the picture of
Mother Carmel
, Pudding tried to shoot Sanji, but he successfully dodged all her attempts. When Pudding began to waver, Daifuku stepped in and
summoned a genie
. He slapped Pudding aside for failing in her task, before proceeding to attack Sanji with the genie.
When Sanji desperately ran towards his family, Daifuku quickly pinned Sanji down with the genie. However, when Luffy caused Big Mom to start her strange scream, Daifuku was immobilized and was unable to stop Sanji from freeing his family.
Much later, Daifuku was given
earplugs
by his brother Katakuri and rose to confront the
Straw Hat
and
Fire Tank Alliance
once more.
Daifuku's genie grabbed
Carrot
as
Bege
's allies were retreating into
his fortress
, but it was then repelled by
Vinsmoke Yonji
after he put on his
raid suit
.
Daifuku and his siblings subdue Reiju and the Straw Hats.
While the Straw Hats, Fire Tank Pirates, and Vinsmoke Family were hiding inside Bege's fortress, Daifuku told his comrades not to allow a single enemy to escape as Big Mom assaulted the fortress. Right after Bege deactivated his Big Father fortress and the Vinsmoke Family appeared, the
Big Mom Pirates
attacked them with a volley of bullets, but
Ichiji
and
Niji
blocked them with their capes.
Caesar Clown
attempted to flee the venue with Bege in tow while Luffy, Sanji, and the Vinsmoke Family faced off against the Big Mom Pirates. In the ensuing conflict, Daifuku,
Galette
, and
Smoothie
subdued Luffy, Sanji, and
Reiju
as they were falling back. However, at that moment, the
Tamatebako
dropped to the base of the
Whole Cake Chateau
and exploded, causing the castle to collapse.
Daifuku and Katakuri forming two pursuit squads.
The Big Mom Pirates were saved when
Streusen
used
his ability
to turn the castle into cake. However, Luffy's group, Bege's crew, and the Vinsmokes got away during the chateau's destruction. Daifuku organized two pursuit teams for the Straw Hats and Fire Tank Pirates.
After informing Katakuri that the pursuit teams had assembled, he was shocked to see Big Mom having a craving illness for wedding cake and was further alarmed to hear that Streusen was severely injured from the fall. After
Perospero
diverted Big Mom's attention to the Straw Hats, Daifuku listened to Pudding as she explained her plan to satiate Big Mom's craving.
He later joined
Brûlée
, Perospero,
Broyé
, and 10,000
Chess Soldiers
inside the
Mirro-World
, awaiting further instructions.
Later, Daifuku, Smoothie,
Compote
, and other forces of the Big Mom Pirates assembled a fleet to hunt down the Straw Hats, the Fire Tank Pirates, and the
Sun Pirates
before any of them could escape
Totto Land
.
Daifuku's genie attacks Carrot as she decimates his fleet.
Daifuku and Smoothie's fleets reached the Straw Hats along with Big Mom and
Bavarois
's
fleet
, surrounding the enemy crew. Daifuku sought to immediately sink the Straw Hats and prepared to fire non-living cannonballs at the
Thousand Sunny
. However, Carrot activated
her Sulong form
and glided toward his ship, where she rapidly attacked his crewmates. Daifuku said that the Sunny would be sunk before Carrot defeated all of his crew, but stopped talking as Carrot destroyed his ship's helm.
Enraged at Carrot's actions, Daifuku summoned his genie to attack Carrot. However, as Carrot dodged the genie's strikes, it instead destroyed several of the ships in Daifuku's fleet. As Carrot continued her assault and broke the helms of the other ships, Daifuku and his fleet fell into disarray.
While his ship was immobilized, he witnessed from afar as Big Mom attacked the Thousand Sunny and was astonished when Jinbe sent Big Mom flying off the ship.
After the Fire Tank Pirates lured Big Mom away, Daifuku went on Smoothie's ship to continue pursuing the Straw Hats. When
Germa 66
was attacking their forces on
Cacao Island
, Daifuku commented that
Mont-d'Or
was outsmarted. His younger sister reminded that he was also outsmarted but he implied that he caught back up.
As the Thousand Sunny sailed away from Cacao Island after Luffy and Sanji made it back, Daifuku used his now much larger genie to attack Carrot on the Sunny's mast but the genie was blocked by Sanji.
After the Sun Pirates arrived, they stopped Smoothie's ship from moving, keeping Daifuku from attacking the Sunny any further.
After the
Queen Mama Chanter
attacked the Sunny, Daifuku expressed confusion when he saw that it was the
Sun Pirates' ship
that was destroyed.
After the Straw Hats escaped, the Big Mom Pirates were later joined by Linlin when she arrived at the island.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
When Big Mom tried to infiltrate
Wano
, Daifuku accompanied his mother and crew as they attempted to climb the waterfall into the country on the
Queen Mama Chanter
. When
Kaidou
's forces attacked their ship to prevent them from reaching Wano, Daifuku used his genie to deflect the enemy's cannonfire. However, just before they reached the top of the waterfall,
King
attacked the ship, causing it to fall off the waterfall and Big Mom to fall into the sea.
On the seas near Wano, Daifuku noted that, as long as King was guarding the skies, the Big Mom Pirates would not be able to enter Wano. When Perospero claimed that, as the eldest son, he should become the new captain of the Big Mom Pirates in the event Big Mom died, Daifuku angrily argued with him, telling him that the position should go to Katakuri, since he was the strongest of them.
The crew later heard about Big Mom's newly formed alliance with Kaidou. On the day of the
Fire Festival
, the Big Mom Pirates attempted to climb the waterfall again, but their ship was knocked down by
Marco
.
