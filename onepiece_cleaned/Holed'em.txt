Appearance
[
]
Holed'em is a large man with long brown hair, a square jaw, cat-like whiskers, and a pointed nose, and also appears to have black lips possibly lipstick. He does not wear a shirt, exposing his hairy chest and tattoos on his upper arms which resemble suns that have a wrench-shaped design inside of them. His most defining features are the
lion
head, forelegs, and tail protruding from his waist due to his
SMILE
fruit.
He wears dark pants, light brown boots, gloves, and a tall dark hat with an insignia on it, plus belt that encases the lion's head and forelegs.
Personality
[
]
Holed'em is a brash and no-nonsense man who takes his job seriously and is quick to loudly rebuke his subordinates when they annoy him. He seems to have little empathy, as shown when he decided to try to use
Tama
's
abilities
by force,
and he is very sadistic, as he became gleeful when threatening to tear Tama apart. Like other members of the Beasts Pirates, he looks down on the lower-class people of Wano. He is also prone to underestimating and condescending people even when he has heard about their feats of strength, as he believed that Luffy only defeated
Urashima
by luck.
He seems to be quick to jump to conclusions, as he believed that Luffy, Zoro, and Kikunojo were accomplices of the thief
Shutenmaru
after simply seeing Luffy's display of strength.
He also holds grudges, as one of his main reasons for attacking Luffy was that the pirate destroyed his house.
Like many One Piece characters, he has a
unique laugh
: Gahahaha.
Relationships
[
]
Kamijiro
[
]
Holed'em and Kamijiro quarreling with each other.
Kamijiro
is the lion head on Holed'em's stomach. Due to their conflicting personalities, Kamijiro frequently fights with Holed'em, overlooking the fact that the pain they deal to each other also hurts themselves.
Enemies

Kouzuki Family
[
]
Due to
Kaidou
forming an alliance with
Kurozumi Orochi

Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
As they attempt to overthrow Kaidou, Holed'em and the rest of the Beasts Pirates are enemies of the
Straw Hat Pirates
. However, due to the isolated nature of Wano, he did not recognize their faces and assumed they were part of
Shutenmaru
's group of bandits. When
Luffy
and
Zoro
were causing trouble in Bakura Town, Holed'em decided to use Tama as a hostage to force them to surrender. However, Holed'em's plan backfired and when Luffy heard how Holed'em harmed Tama, Luffy quickly attacked him.
Tama

History

Past
[
]
Holed'em was born 30 years ago in
Wano Country
as the son of
Norinosuke
, a self-proclaimed shaman. At some point in his life, he joined the
Beasts Pirates
. He was later promoted to
Shinuchi
and assigned to
Kuri
, which was under
Jack
's jurisdiction.
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After
Gazelleman
kidnapped
Tama
at
Okobore Town
, he reported to Holed'em in
Bakura Town
that he had captured the girl who
tamed
their baboon
, and Holed'em ordered Gazelleman to bring Tama to him.
Gazelleman brought Tama to Holed'em's quarters, and Holed'em was annoyed at the Gifter's exhaustion after running. He then got mad at
Kamijiro
for staring at him, and the defiant lion responded by striking Holed'em in the groin, hurting both of them. Holed'em wanted to know how Tama managed to tame their baboon, and suspected that she had a
Devil Fruit
power despite her denial. He ordered a subordinate to get him some pliers so he could try pulling food out of her cheek.
Luffy strikes Holed'em with Red Hawk.
As Holed'em was pulling on Tama's cheek, he received a report that the yokozuna
Urashima
had been attacked, but did not care. However, Urashima was then sent flying into Holed'em's house by
Monkey D. Luffy
, and an annoyed Holed'em confronted Luffy, putting Tama into Kamijiro's mouth and threatening to crush her.
After Holed'em accused Luffy's group of being accomplices with the thief
Shutenmaru
, Luffy managed to attack Kamijiro in the blink of an eye and free Tama. Soon afterwards, Luffy turned around to attack Holed'em, and Holed'em had Kamijiro breathe fire at the pirate as he prepared to strike Luffy with the Karakuri Sword. However, the flames were ineffective against Luffy, who struck Holed'em in the face with a powerful
Red Hawk punch
, defeating him.
Kamijiro remained conscious as Holed'em laid unconscious on the ground.
When he woke up later, Holed'em saw
Kaidou
in Kuri and shook in fear, wondering if Kaidou had come to execute him. He was then stunned to see his captain destroy the ruins of Kuri Castle.
Several days later, Holed'em ordered his men to set Mt. Atama on fire in order to kill Shutenmaru. Holed'em heard about important events happening at the
Flower Capital
and ordered his men to turn on the
Picture Tanishi
to watch a broadcast. Holed'em also commented that he wished he could show Shutenmaru dying in a fire to the whole country.
Holed'em later watched the broadcast of
Yasuie
's execution.
Prior to the
Fire Festival
, Holed'em confronted the Okobore Town citizens concerning the continued thefts from Paradise Farm.
Tsuru
approached Holed'em, claiming that she would help him, but the Okobore Town citizens took the blame for the thefts. Holed'em then burned Okobore Town to the ground.
