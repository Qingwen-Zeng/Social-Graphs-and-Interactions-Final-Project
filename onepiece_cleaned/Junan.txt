Junan was first seen reacting in surprise when
Nami
bargained to purchase some of the store's merchandise at less than half of the original price. When Pappag arrived, Junan was relieved to see him but was then shocked when Nami was pinching Pappag while complaining about the store's prices. After Pappag allowed the
Straw Hats
to take anything they wanted, Junan informed the store's owner that they took all the merchandise.
