History

Past
[

After
Caesar Clown
neutralized the
poison gas
that
Jack
used to devastate the
Mokomo Dukedom
, Miyagi helped
Tony Tony Chopper
treat the poisoned minks.
Zou Arc
[
]
When it was reported that
Inuarashi
had woken from his coma, Miyagi and
Tristan
excitedly ran after Chopper to help him tend to the duke.
At the duke's home, Miyagi, Tristan, and Chopper were tending to the duke when
Wanda
brought the rest of the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
When dusk arrived, Miyagi and Tristan fell asleep.
The following day, as
Bariete
rang the bell and spoke of the arrival of
samurai
, Miyagi and the rest of the minks rushed to Kurau City. When
Kin'emon
and
Kanjuro
revealed themselves, Miyagi and the minks welcomed them and revealed that
Raizo
was on
Zou
before standing proudly at having kept his presence a secret.
When Inuarashi,
Nekomamushi
, the samurai, and the pirates returned from the Whale Tree with
Raizo
, Zou began shaking as
Zunesha
started crying out, throwing Miyagi and the others into a state of panic.
Jack had returned and was attempting to destroy Zou by killing Zunesha, who retaliated on
Kouzuki Momonosuke
's command and sank Jack's fleet with one blow, calming down Miyagi and the others in the process.
Miyagi and the minks help Chopper treat Zunesha's injured leg.
Shortly afterward, Miyagi, Chopper, and several other minks treated Zunesha's injured leg, with Miyagi praising Chopper's combination of the
Sakura Kingdom
's medical expertise and the
Torino Kingdom
's medicinal knowledge. As he marveled at Zunesha's ability to hear and understand, Miyagi noted that the
Mink Tribe
's residence on Zou would one day come to an end before wondering where Zunesha had been heading for the past 1000 years.
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After the Mink Tribe infiltrated
Wano Country
, Miyagi visited Amigasa Village and tended to
Tama
.
Chopper, Miyagi, and Tristan fire the Chopperphage Nebulizer.
During the
raid on Onigashima
, Miyagi and Tristan arrived at the Live Stage to assist Chopper in mass-producing the antidote for
Queen
's
Ice Oni
virus.
Miyagi later heard
Sanji
's cry for help broadcasted throughout
Onigashima
.
After mass-producing the antidote, Miyagi and Tristan distributed the
Chopperphage
via a cannon.
After Sanji left the heavily bandaged
Roronoa Zoro
in their care,
Miyagi told Zoro about an instant recovery medicine from Zou but warned about its powerful side effects after it wore off.
Because of the layers of bandages, Miyagi had to drive the needle in deep, which concerned Zoro, before successfully injecting the medicine.
Miyagi, Chopper, and Tristan were forced to flee, with samurai carrying Zoro, when
King
ordered his subordinates to kill Zoro before the medicine took full effect. After
Marco
defended his allies from King's attack, Zoro burst from his bandages and joined Sanji in fighting off King and Queen.
After Zoro defeated King, Miyagi was surprised to see Chopper transform back into his normal form, but Chopper was more concerned over the medicine's side effects on Zoro.
Everyone on the Live Floor was rocked off their feet when
Big Mom
accidentally detonated some bombs in the basement as she fell through Onigashima.
After defeating Luffy again,
Kaidou
flew down to the Live Floor and announced his victory, which disheartened the alliance and rallied the
Beasts Pirates
;
however, Luffy reawaked and pulled Kaidou back to the rooftop.
When the fires threatened to consume everything in the Skull Dome, Raizo and
Jinbe
worked together to flood the castle with water from Zou.
Afterwards, the island was brought safely down to Wano, and Nekomamushi announced Luffy's victory over Kaidou. Chopper, Miyagi, and Tristan then began treating the vast number of injured.
A week later, the three continued treating Luffy's and Zoro's injuries after the two had awakened and begun feasting.
