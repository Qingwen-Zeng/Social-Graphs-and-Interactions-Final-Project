Appearance
[
]
Speed Jiru's concept art from the anime.
Speed Jiru is somewhat a round man of average height, wearing a brown fez with a white
Whitebeard
's insignia and a white robe with brown sleeves/leggings, both with Whiteboard's insignia printed on them. He wields a jousting lance for a weapon. He also carries a golden heater shield, also with a purple Whitebeard's insignia.
Personality
[
]
Speed Jiru is very loyal to the Whitebeard Pirates and Whitebeard, as he was willing to risk his own life in order to save Ace from execution during the war at Marineford.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the commander of the 14th Division, Speed Jiru has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
In the anime, true to his name, he is shown to have extremely fast movements. A proof of this is when
Admiral
Kizaru
launched a laser beam to stop him and his division from getting closer to the broken wall
Oars
made he was seen evading it by jumping backward, and commenting on Kizaru's "speed of light" attack. This is quite a remarkable feat considering the fact that Kizaru can move and shoot beams from his body without himself or his beams even getting noticed due to sheer, unmitigated speed (evidenced when
X Drake
fought Kizaru and just noticed a blink of light from far away, when Kizaru actually was already in front of him aiming a kick).
Also, his combined strength and agility is astounding, as seen when he took the offense and dashed forward to engage the
Marines
: in a split second, a group of them was easily eliminated.
His body structure also seems to change from time to time as shown in both the manga and anime, if this is because of a
Devil Fruit
, a technique like
Life Return
or simply a drawing mistake is unknown.
