Genzo
is the
sheriff
of
Cocoyasi Village
. He is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Arlong Park Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Genzo is an average-sized, dark-haired man with a thick mustache; his face typically shows a stern expression. His only known outfit is a brown, short-sleeved
policeman
-esque uniform with sandals; for more than a decade, he wore a pinwheel in this uniform's cap as a means (and later, a memento) of cheering up
Nami
.
After the
Arlong Pirates
invaded Cocoyasi Village, his face and body were heavily scarred by an attack from
Kuroobi
.
Some time after the
Summit War of Marineford
, he began to grow a bit of stubble on his chin.
Personality
[
]
As
Bell-mère
was growing up, she was known as the village trouble maker (he refers to her as
you little thug
). Her reputation caused him to express concerns over the children's well-being when she announced she was adopting them as her daughters. He has had close ties with both
Nami
and
Nojiko
since they were kids because of his concern over their adoptive mother's capabilities and spent most of his time watching out for them. Eventually this grew into a desire just to see all three of them live together and grow together as a happy family.
After their mother's death, he became concerned for the happiness of Nami and Nojiko, as he had grown into a father figure to them. He and the other villagers realized Nami would never join up with Arlong's crew without good reason. His concern for her and Nojiko's well being also led him to promise
Luffy
that he would hunt him down and kill him if he ever took away Nami's smile.
He kept the town together after
Arlong
took over the island, making sure everyone was safe and able to pay Arlong's tax. Whenever there was trouble between the villagers and Arlong or his crew, he took full responsibility for everything so the villagers would not be punished. He helped keep the village together to give Nami the time to complete her plan to save the village. When her 8 years of hard work to save them fell apart after Arlong's betrayal, he decided enough was enough. If they were going to die, they would die trying to fight Arlong even with Nami pleading that she can just start all over again.
Genzo also has a perverted side, as he becomes quite flustered when Bell-mère offered to pay back the items the latter stole "with her body"
but when Nami parroted Belle-mere's words, Genzo just yelled at the girl not to pick up her adoptive mother's bad habits. Genzo has a blown-up image of Nami's wanted poster, in which she appears in a bikini, despite stating that she shouldn't have posed like that as it would draw the attention of more perverts (Marriage seekers in the English version) than bounty hunters.
Genzo was also horrified to see Nami's brazen new dress sense in the papers and imagined faceless leering pirates around her.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Nothing more than an ordinary fighter, Genzo lacks any great strength and was easily defeated by Arlong and his crew when he tried to save Bell-mère and her children. However, he has great leadership skills and was the binding force that helped the village survive Arlong and his crew.
Weapons
[
]
Although he is never seen using it, Genzo carries a standard sabre. He also used a pair of pistols when Arlong first came to the island.
History
[

Past
[
]
In the past, Genzo grew familiar with
Bell-mère
, a child who caused much trouble. He came to refer to her as 'you little thug' as a result of it. However, a shock came upon him and the others when one Bell-mère declared she was going to join the
Marines
and fight bad pirates. Later, he was at the dock when she returned to the village with two small children. He was the first to protest when Bell-mère declared she was old enough to look after children, and suggested they be raised in a government orphanage but Bell-mère ultimately chose to help and raise
Nojiko
and
Nami
grow up in the troubled world they lived in, Genzo would also go on to watch over Nami.
Genzo kept a close eye on her, but often Nami would cry upon seeing him. Bell-mère remarked that Nami cried when she saw Genzo because he looked scary. To avoid this, Genzo put a pinwheel on his hat to make Nami laugh.
As Nami was growing up, Genzo kept an eye on her because she was renowned for stealing, often referring to her as Bell-mère's 'little cat' upon returning her home. While he was fully aware of how Bell-mère easily got her own way with him, often he would agree to do what she asked because she would say things to embarrass him (
E.g. "I will repay you... With my body"
, in the 4kids Dub she simply comments that he takes her fruit without asking).
He was the first to find Nami when she ran away from home and then finally revealed her origins.
Soon after Nojiko came looking for Nami, he was seen agreeing with the other villagers that although the three girls struggle to get by, they are happy, and thus that everyone should do their best to keep them as such. However, as Nami and Nojiko were running off,
Arlong
and
his crew
of
fish-men
showed up. He told them to go hide behind the houses because it was dangerous on the street.
Genzo is wounded by Kuroobi.
Genzo had enough money to save his family. To his horror, Genzo spotted smoke coming from Bell-mère's house. He said to himself that Bell-mère doesn't have enough money to buy her and her daughters' lives from the pirate. He was terrified when he heard that one of the fish-men saw the smoke and went to her place to try to save her. When
Hatchan
looked into the house and saw that the woman was preparing a meal for 3, he lied that Bell-mère invited him and another friend for dinner. When Arlong kidnapped Nami, Genzo used two pistols to try to stop him, but he was easily defeated by
Kuroobi
. As a result of this incident, Genzo was left with large scars all across his body.
Soon afterward, he formed a rebellion to storm
Arlong Park
to free Nami, but learned that Nami had joined Arlong's crew. Disgusted with Nami, he ordered her to never set foot in the village again. However, he later became suspicious of why Nami would join Arlong, and made Nojiko tell him about her plan to buy Cocoyasi Village. In order to prevent her from feeling that the villagers were counting on her, and that she could not escape if she wanted, he resolved never to reveal that he knew her motives.
For the next eight years, Genzo managed to pay the money to save his life from
Arlong
's tyranny until the pirate was defeated.

Arlong Park Arc
[
]
Having endured Arlong and his crew for many years, Genzo began to put various plans of rebellion into place. Things went wrong and the weapons the villagers were hiding were discovered. He barely escaped death when
Usopp
stepped in and interfered.
After losing all the money she had saved to buy her village, Genzo was disgusted that Arlong sent the Marines after Nami in order to keep her working for him forever. He and the villagers decided they finally had enough and headed off to Arlong Park to fight with the pirates despite Nami's tearful plea.
They were stopped by
Johnny
and
Yosaku
,who stood guard at the entrance to prevent anyone from entering until
Luffy
,
Zoro
,
Sanji
, and Usopp arrived. During the fight with Arlong and his crew, he and Nojiko focused on keeping Luffy alive when he was thrown into the water at Arlong Park after getting stuck in concrete.
They used Luffy's Devil Fruit powers and stretched his head out of the water before taking turns attempting to free him from the pinning rock.
Sanji dove into the pool to free the rock while Genzo held Luffy's stretched head above water. However,
Hatchan
appeared and attempted to attack Sanji. Nojiko dove in the way to take the brunt of Hatchan's punches. As a result of the strain, the wounds Hatchan received from Zoro opened and halted his attack. Sanji finally destroyed the rock and Luffy was freed.
After Arlong was defeated
, he and the villagers celebrated freedom from the fish-men who had made them suffer all these years. Their celebration was almost cut short as
Nezumi
arrived to spoil the fun. He ordered the riches of Arlong Park to be brought to the Marines. However, Zoro stepped in and Nami helped push Nezumi out of town so that the villagers could keep the money.
Genzo's pinwheel by Bell-mère's original grave.
He later met Luffy by Bell-mère's grave and told him that if he ever takes Nami's smile away, he would kill him.
After Nami sailed off with Luffy and crew, Genzo said he no longer needed his pinwheel, placing it by Bell-mère's grave.
