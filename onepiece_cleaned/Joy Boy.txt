Legacy
[
]
The original Joy Boy left
messages
regarding his return 800 years later. One of those messages was to
Fish-Man Island
and to
Poseidon
, apologizing for breaking his promise, and promising that someone would fulfill it in the future.
Another message was left at the unnamed island, claiming that he would return in 800 years' time before he died.
Over 20 years before the present, when the
Roger Pirates
conquered the
Grand Line
by reaching the then-unnamed island, they read the message and learned the true history of the
world
but decided to leave it as is, realizing they were too early.
Roger found the story hilarious and declared that he wished he and Joy Boy could have lived during the same period upon learning the true history, and subsequently named the island
Laugh Tale
.

Fish-Man Island's half of the promise was almost broken during the events of the
Fish-Man Island Arc
, when
Monkey D. Luffy
was asked to protect the island no matter what the cost, even if it meant that
Noah
had to be destroyed in the process. Before Luffy could destroy the
ship
completely, Noah's fall was stopped by a group of
Sea Kings
that were summoned unknowingly by
Shirahoshi
, thus saving Fish-Man Island and maintaining the nation's promise to Joy Boy.
However, the ship was still heavily damaged. The Sea Kings then took the ship to the
Sea Forest
, where they planned to fix it.
When
Dr. Vegapunk
broadcasted his dying message during the
Egghead Incident
he revealed to the world what he knew about Joy Boy including that he was from the Great Kingdom and his status as the original pirate.
Joy Boy's long-sealed Supreme King Haki was eventually released by Emet to save the life of Monkey D. Luffy from the
Five Elders
on
Egghead
.
Second Coming
[
]
According to
King
Neptune
, there is a legend in the
royal family
regarding the person who will fulfill Joy Boy's promise.
Amatsuki
Toki
used the abilities of her
Devil Fruit
to travel to Wano in the future in search of the day of Joy Boy's return.
During the
Roger Pirates
' journey, after
Kouzuki Oden
joined, they travelled to
Fish-Man Island
and on their way, both
Roger
and Oden heard the
Sea Kings
talk about the birth of someone who will lead them in 25 years along with the
new
Poseidon
.
After the crew's discovery on
Laugh Tale
, Oden returned to his home in
Wano Country
, which also had a connection to Joy Boy, and made plans to open up the enclosed land in preparations for Joy Boy's return.
However, his efforts were foiled when the
shogunate
was usurped by
Kurozumi Orochi
aided by the
pirate
Kaidou
, culminating in Oden's death during the
Legendary Hour
, thus he left the task to his
retainers
.
At an unknown point in time,
Kaidou
also learned about Joy Boy and began searching for the next one for an unknown reason. Kaidou also came to believe that Joy Boy would be someone who come and defeat him in battle someday.
King
, a member of the
Lunarian
race
, seemingly believed that Kaidou himself could have become Joy Boy and changed the
world
, although he eventually came to dismiss the figure as a mere legend.
Sometime after Oden's death,
Yamato
, Kaidou's child and an admirer of Oden, took up his name and after learning the truth from Oden's
journal
, worked to fulfill his dream.
Luffy awakens his powers and becomes the next Joy Boy.
After
Monkey D. Luffy
was knocked out by Kaidou on the
Skull Dome
rooftop during the
Raid on Onigashima
, in his unconscious state, his heartbeat gained the qualities of what
Zunesha
claimed to be the "
Drums of Liberation
"
(
解放のドラム
,
Kaihō no Doramu
?
)
, causing the ancient pachyderm to declare that Joy Boy had returned.
Luffy soon regained consciousness with a wild grin, as the
awakening
of his
Devil Fruit
activated. He then transformed into his
Gear 5
form for the first time and challenged Kaidou again.
After Luffy won the match, as the Emperor plummeted through the crater he was punched into, Kaidou recalled an earlier conversation he had with King where he said that Joy Boy would be the one to defeat him, implying that in his final moments, he recognized that Luffy was the same Joy Boy he'd waited for after all.
After the battle
Kouzuki Momonosuke
the
shogun
of Wano honored Luffy's wishes by not revealing his name to the people of Wano, so they now know him as Joy Boy and heard how he defeated Kaidou; thus, the name Joy Boy has become a legendary figure in Wano as its citizens greatly express their gratitude.
