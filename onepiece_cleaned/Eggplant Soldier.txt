The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
While patrolling the hallways of Whole Cake Chateau, Eggplant Soldier and another guard came across Big Mom as she was laughing. They commented on Big Mom's happy mood and equated it to the upcoming wedding and tea party. Eggplant Soldier then imagined Pudding smiling and hoped that she would be happy for her wedding.
After
Sanji
accepted his fate of marriage, he tried to impress
Pudding
with his chivalry and was assisted by Eggplant Soldier, whom he had asked where to find flowers. After pacing around the room for quite some time, Eggplant Soldier suggested that Sanji check the courtyard and offered to lead the way. However, Sanji said that it was fine and got up to go himself. As Sanji walked towards the door, Eggplant Soldier asked him why he needed flowers, but he never got an answer as Sanji was busy being infatuated by Pudding, much to his confusion.

When Eggplant Soldier returned from getting groceries for Sanji, he reported to him that
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Nami
had already been captured and that
Soul King
and the
male mink
were currently running amok. However, as he was explaining that the guards were having trouble, Sanji abruptly cut him off and asked for the ingredients, instead. Hearing this, Eggplant Soldier offered to get Sanji a meal, but the latter explained that he was concerned for Pudding and wanted to cook for her, to which Eggplant Soldier agreed that Pudding was still feeling poorly.
Later, when Sanji finally left for Pudding's room, Eggplant Soldier asked him what he was doing and wondered if he was going for a walk, seemingly oblivious to where Sanji's intended destination was.
Hours later at night, while the
Big Mom Pirates
were having a meeting about the recent events, a Chess Soldier checked in on Sanji to confirm his status, but because Eggplant Soldier was sleeping in Sanji's bed, Sanji was mistakenly reported to be there. Eggplant Soldier then awoke in a panic and realized he had fallen asleep in Sanji's bed, but upon noticing that the latter had not returned, he decided to go back to sleep.

The following morning, Eggplant Soldier was abruptly awaken by
Mont-d'Or
pounding on the door. Knowing that Mont-d'Or was looking for Sanji, he began to panic for he had lost track of him. Under the pressure of Mont-d'Or's pounding, Eggplant Soldier became more panicked and worried, especially since he realized that
Big Mom
would kill him for, not only having failed to keep an eye on Sanji, but for also having fallen asleep while on duty.
Eggplant Soldier and Sanji are interrogated by Mont-d'Or and Galette.
However, immediately after, Sanji came back through the window and asked Eggplant Soldier to help him lie. Seeing as how he would be able to get out of potential trouble, he happily agreed. When Mont-d'Or finally opened the door, Eggplant Soldier was called to testify if Sanji had been in the room all night. In response, he affirmed that Sanji had been there the whole time. However, as Mont-d'Or continued to ask the same question, Eggplant Soldier began to sweat and panic, but he was saved by Sanji when the latter interrupted the interrogation. When Mont-d'Or left, Eggplant Soldier finally let out a deep sigh and told Sanji how he had surprised him. He then asked Sanji where he had been, and Sanji told him that he went to Pudding's room as he told him earlier and advised him not to ask what happened afterward as it wouldn't be cool.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, Eggplant Soldier's role is expanded. He first appears patrolling the hallways, rather than in the manga in which he was first seen helping Sanji.
Later, his role is further expanded when he and Sanji lie about the latter's whereabouts during the night before to Mont-d'Or.
