Appearance
[
]
Carrot is a white-furred, blonde-haired rabbit mink with brown eyes, rabbit ears, a rabbit-like nose, a large round fluffy tail, but with a body otherwise similar to that of a human adolescent girl. She is shorter than average, with a height of 161 cm (5'3").
In her first appearance, she wore a short orange dress with laced-up open sides with the
Guardians
' signature green cape,
a single rabbit paw-like gauntlet, and brown, high-heeled boots.
She wears this same outfit during the
Raid on Onigashima
. After becoming ruler, Carrot now wears a thicker, hooded version of her previous cape.
Upon sneaking aboard the
Thousand Sunny
, she changed to a similar short orange dress with the word "RABBIT" at the front with a thick darker orange trim and a single white stripe in the middle, a black cap, and yellow loafers.
She also had a backpack and a canteen.
Later on, she was seen wearing another short orange dress with a puffy skirt and a hood, and retained her cap and loafers.
After reaching
Totto Land
, Carrot donned a simple, light-green short-skirt dress decorated with three vertical stripes running down the center and frills at the bottom, neck, and sleeves, and tied up at the front with an orange bow, as well as a pair of orange dress shoes.
An additional accessory includes an orange hat.
At the meeting with the
Fire Tank Pirates
, she wore a
flapper
-style outfit of a white cloche hat with a pink rose, a sleeveless white blouse with a frilly collar and pink ribbon, a frilly black skirt, and black pumps.
Her outfit had different colors (yellow blouse, red skirt, and orange pumps) in the original "
Hope
" opening.
At the start of the
Wano Country Arc
, she wore a simple short salmon pink halter dress with a carrot design and the word "Ninjin" (Japanese for "Carrot"), as well as frills at the bottom. After Kin'emon used
his powers
to disguise her as a kunoichi, Carrot donned a light polka-dotted veil concealing her ears, a light green kimono with orange and green floral prints, and simple straw sandals.
When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, she wore a Beasts Pirates attire. Her outfit consists of a strapless green bikini armor, lighter green shoulder pads with white edges, and a furry magenta cape, however it appears black in the manga.
During the post-raid festival, she donned a short turquoise kimono with yellow floral patterns and a rose-pink obi.
After being appointed ruler of the Mokomo Dukedom, Carrot wears a puffy coat with a bow.
During her training under
Shishilian
, she wore a red
musketeer
hat and a light-green dress with thin straps, and her hair was slightly shorter.
When Carrot activates her Sulong form on a full moon, her eyes turn red with black sclera, her ears grow larger, her hair and tail grow considerably and turn snow white in color, and they both emit Electro sparks. The fur around her neckline turns much thicker, vaguely resembling a lion's mane, and her claws become longer and sharper. Upon seeing this form,
Nami
considers it to be "so beautiful." and
Jinbe
comments that "it's quite mesmerizing."

Personality
[
]
Carrot is very protective of the
Mokomo Dukedom
and is highly aggressive towards intruders.
Like other minks, she refers to
humans
as "lesser minks".
Carrot is also protective of people she cares about. When the
Straw Hat Pirates
were met by
Germa 66
, Carrot was willing to fight the evil army in order to protect them.
She can also be very emotional; when
Monkey D. Luffy
ate poisonous fish skin and was left on the verge of death, Carrot begged him not to die and tearfully embraced him once the poison was sucked out of him.
After
Pedro
sacrificed himself in a suicidal explosion, Carrot became devastated and cried profoundly before becoming enraged to where she attempted to take it out on
Katakuri
.
Carrot gnaws on Luffy's ear.
Like a regular rabbit, she likes to gnaw on things, including people such as Luffy.
She loves carrots to the point where her provisions for the trip to
Whole Cake Island
consisted entirely of them, and she ferociously attacked Luffy when she saw him eating her carrot.
She also loves chocolate.
Though feral and vicious when attacking someone, Carrot can be quickly calmed down if someone pats her head.
Despite her warrior status, she seems to be naive and childish about serious matters and the world beyond
Zou
; she was easily excited by events new to her; when she heard Luffy was planning to crash
Big Mom
's party and ruin the wedding ceremony, she believed it would be exciting to take part in, not realizing the extreme danger she would be facing in doing so,
and she was later surprised to hear that it would take several days to reach Whole Cake Island because of how big the ocean was, having believed that it was small enough to only warrant half a day's worth of provisions.
Additionally, she is not familiar with some natural weather phenomena, having mistaken lightning for
Electro
upon witnessing it at sea.
She has always wanted to see the outside world and go on an adventure, and upon her discovery aboard the Thousand Sunny, she begged
Pedro
not to take her home immediately out of fear of being berated by
Wanda
.
She is apparently scared of ghosts as she was frightened by Brook's soul form.
Despite her naivete, she has also proven that she can be rather clever and deceiving; she quickly devised a plot to use
Charlotte Brûlée
's
mirror based powers
against her and successfully fooled several
Big Mom Pirates
into thinking that they had captured her.
Carrot blushing while in Sulong form.
Whenever she transforms into her Sulong form, Carrot seemingly becomes more confident and vicious in combat. However, despite her drastic change in appearance and abilities, she still maintained her original personality, as shown when she blushed while fighting Charlotte Daifuku's crew. However, she proved to be more cunning than usual, as when she removed the steering wheel off of Daifuku's ship to keep them from going after the Sunny, and when she tricked his
genie
into attacking its master's fleet.
Relationships
[
]
Friends and Allies
[
]
Mink Tribe
[
]
Carrot is loyal to her fellow minks and has a close friendship with
Wanda
. Though Wanda was initially worried when the minks could not find Carrot after the latter snuck onboard the
Thousand Sunny
, Wanda admitted that she was simply glad to know where she was.
Carrot, on the other hand, was afraid that Wanda would berate her if the Sanji Retrieval Team return to Zou, and pleaded
Pedro
not to send her back.
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
had great faith in her, naming her their successor as ruler of the Mokomo Dukedom. Despite her youth and there being more experienced warriors, the entire tribe full-heartedly supported this choice, offering their power to help her rule.
Pedro
[
]
Pedro gives Carrot her gauntlets.
Since her days training as a Musketeer, Carrot has looked up to Pedro despite his occupation as a
Guardian
. He was even caring enough to gift her own gauntlets after witnessed her lack of talent for swordsmanship, and helped develop her combat prowess as her sparring partner. Their bond was even close enough for him to reiterate
Gol D. Roger
's advice as encouragement.
When Carrot snuck aboard the
Thousand Sunny
, Pedro was worried about the danger she would be put in and asked to bring her back to Zou much to her own dismay. He ultimately vouched for her strength after Luffy agreed to let her stay.
Before their escape, Pedro expressed his final thoughts to Carrot, having been convinced that the Straw Hats will be the ones to lead the
world
to its
dawn
.
After telling Carrot she would understand the importance of helping the Straw Hats someday, Pedro made his sacrifice by detonating the explosives on his body in order to take out
Perospero
.
.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Carrot and Sanji console each other over Pedro's death.
Like the other minks, Carrot is grateful to the Straw
Hats
for saving the citizens of Zou after they were devastated by
Jack
's invasion. Carrot even joined the Sanji Retrieval Team in entering Big Mom's territory to rescue their captive crewmate and though they initially wanted to bring her back to Zou, they nonetheless allowed her to join. Carrot has become close to
Chopper
, giving him the nickname "Choniki"
(
チョニキ
?
)
,
and the two worked together in defeating
Charlotte Brûlée
. Like the others, she was excited to hear
Sanji
again and was bashful when they received praise from
Luffy
in completing their assigned tasks.
After the Sanji Retrieval Team escaped Totto Land, Carrot was overjoyed at the prospect of eating Sanji's food again.
Enemies
[
]
Beasts Pirates
[
]
When Jack invaded Zou in search of Raizo, Carrot took a stand against his forces alongside the other minks. Like the rest of her tribe, she has sworn to never forgive Jack for destroying their country.
As a member of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, Carrot is an enemy to the entire
Beasts Pirates
and
Kurozumi Family
, intending to assist the
Kouzuki Family
to overthrow them and restore
Wano Country
to its former glory.
Big Mom Pirates
[
]
Carrot became an enemy of Big Mom's family and crew during the mission to retrieve Sanji from Totto Land. At the Seducing Woods, she clashed against
Randolph
, who was sent to deal with the intruders.
Charlotte Brûlée
is also very antagonistic towards Carrot, saying that she wants to slice the latter's face because of how pretty it is.
After imprisoning Carrot in the
Mirro-World
, Brûlée planned to put her in boiling soup, although this failed. She further earned the latter's fury by using her power to navigate through Big Mom's territory to find her friends. After
Pedro
sacrificed himself in a suicidal explosion, Carrot was filled with sorrow and rage, to where she took it out on Katakuri. Carrot dealt a critical blow to
Charlotte Daifuku
when she transformed and disabled his ship to prevent him from chasing the
Thousand Sunny
.
Charlotte Perospero
[
]
Carrot and Wanda attack Perospero for Pedro's death.
Carrot holds a strong grudge against Perospero, as when Carrot saw that Perospero survived
Pedro
's suicide attack, she was shocked and furious to see that he resisted her friend's sacrifice, and when Perospero guided Big Mom to walk the sea surface, she remained angry at him.
When she discovered that Perospero was on
Onigashima
, she immediately made it her goal to track him down,
and attacked him, despite his assertion that he had nothing to do with Pedro's choice to sacrifice himself.
Though even with
Wanda
's help, the two were swiftly defeated upon losing their Sulong forms due to the clouds covering the full moon.
However, the two later witnessed
Nekomamushi
confronting Perospero,
and watch the full fight as Nekomamushi avenged Pedro's death by defeating Perospero personally.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Carrot has proven to be a strong warrior. Upon noticing that
Monkey D. Luffy
was eating her carrot, an enraged Carrot quickly overwhelmed him before being calmed down, although this was an oversight on the part of the pirate
; this prompted
Pedro
, an extremely strong mink warrior and captain of the Guardians to vouch for her usefulness in a fight.
Carrot possesses a strong will as she was able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's
Supreme King Haki
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Further information:
Electro
As a mink, Carrot is a natural-born fighter
and can use Electro.
Having been a
Kingsbird
, she possesses a large amount of stamina, which allows her to be active at all hours of the day.
Carrot floats over Zoro's attack.
Carrot is immensely quick and agile, having effortlessly dodged a slash from
Roronoa Zoro
.
She is also capable of flipping backward multiple times and attacking immediately afterwards.
Carrot can levitate and jump in midair
as well as jump extremely high.
She is highly perceptive and has incredible reflexes, being able to notice
Randolph
's extremely quick ambush before
Nami
and
Chopper
did, and managing to pull them out of harm's way a split second before Randolph attacked them.
Her immense speed is further shown when she instantly caught Diesel who is an extremely fast runner, despite him having a running start.
Carrot is also physically very strong, as she is capable of carrying two large weights in her arms while still being able to run at the same time. She has incredible leg strength as she can topple a massive pot of boiling soup towards Brûlée with a kick. She is considerably durable, as she was able to sit back up after being stomped to the ground by
Charlotte Katakuri
, one of the Sweet Commanders of the Big Mom Pirates.
Sulong Form
[
]
Further information:
Sulong
Carrot transforms into her Sulong form.
As a member of the
Mink Tribe
, Carrot is able to awaken the Sulong transformation when looking at the full moon. In this form, Carrot's strength, speed, agility, Electro, and fighting abilities are magnified, allowing her to take out multiple members of the
Big Mom Pirates
in the blink of an eye, and rip out the helm of
Charlotte Daifuku
's ship. Her gliding abilities have also improved, as she was able to glide from the crow's nest of the
Thousand Sunny
to Daifuku's ship a great distance away.
Using this form has a risk as it can cause severe exhaustion if used for too long.
She can revert back to her normal form by blocking her eyes from moonlight.
Artistic Skill
[
]
Carrot presents her artwork.
Carrot is skilled at drawing, but she has a tendency to draw people
very effeminately
. She is able to draw the faces of the Sanji Retrieval Team from memory.
According to herself, she is also very good at drawing maps.
Weapons
[
]
Carrot's clawed paw gauntlet.
Carrot wears two clawed gauntlets on her hands that resemble rabbit paws. They were given to her by Pedro when he believed that she could not handle a sword.
They are strong enough to clash evenly with Zoro's swords and can have Electro channeled through them.
When she encountered Luffy's group back when they first arrived on Zou, she wore a gauntlet only on her right hand.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
At some point in her youth, Carrot joined the
Inuarashi Musketeer Squad
and was trained in swordsmanship by
Shishilian
. However, she lacked talent with the weapon, which caused
Pedro
to take her under his wing and give her a pair of gauntlets instead.
During the Timeskip
[
]
When the
Beasts Pirates
, led by
Jack
, attacked
Zou
in search of
Raizo
, Carrot and the rest of the Inuarashi Musketeer Squad fought against them until 6:00 PM, at which point
Inuarashi
ordered them to retreat so
Nekomamushi
and the
Guardians
could take over the battle.
The battle against the Beast Pirates lasted for five days. On the fifth day of the battle, Jack lost his patience and unleashed
Caesar Clown
's
Koro
gas, which left the
Mink Tribe
poisoned and drastically weakened.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
The following day, Jack left Zou after hearing about
Donquixote Doflamingo
's defeat and capture,
and the minks were later saved when
Sanji
and his group came to Zou.
After
Capone Bege
took Sanji and Caesar, Nekomamushi told Carrot and
Wanda
to keep quiet about the incident because that was what
Nami
and her friends wanted.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Zou Arc
[
]
Carrot saw
Roronoa Zoro
,
Franky
,
Usopp
,
Nico Robin
, and
Trafalgar D. Water Law
enter the
Mokomo Dukedom
and, assuming that they had beaten the
guard
outside, rushed at them. Zoro attempted to attack her, but she evaded his strike before clashing with him. However, Wanda appeared and told Carrot to stop because they needed to deal with the intruder in the Whale Forest.
Carrot and Wanda take Luffy to the Right Belly Fortress.
Shocked by this news, Carrot jumped high into the air to survey the situation and informed Wanda of the ongoing scuffle in the forest before joining her atop
Wany
and heading to the source of the disturbance. En route, Carrot learned that she had just attacked members of the
Straw Hat Pirates
and noted that they were in for a shock. Shortly afterward, Carrot reached the Whale Forest with Wanda and calmed down
Roddy
, who was fighting with
Monkey D. Luffy
, by giving him a fluttering cloth to attack.
As she, Wanda, and Luffy rode on Wany through
Zunesha
's self-washing deluge of seawater, Carrot explained how the twice-daily washing brought plenty of fish for the minks to eat before revealing that
Bepo
was under the care of Master Nekomamushi because he was a pirate as she bit on Luffy's ear. However, as they passed the crucifixes that Jack had used to torture some of the minks, Carrot quickly grew somber. After the other Straw Hats appeared, Carrot and the others arrived at Right Belly Fortress.
Later, Carrot took part in a feast with the Straw Hats and several other minks, where she explained to Usopp that they refused to eat any meat from animals with fur.
After the Straw Hats visited Inuarashi, Carrot and Wanda traveled with them to the Whale Forest to meet Nekomamushi.
Carrot expresses excitement at Luffy's plan to infiltrate Big Mom's territory.
Once they arrived, Carrot and Wanda went with Luffy, Nami, and Pedro to see
Pekoms
, who was left behind by the
Big Mom Pirates
.
Laughing at Luffy's proclamation that the Big Mom Pirates would become subordinate to him after he confronted
Big Mom
, Carrot was disturbed by Pekoms's explanation of what would happen if Sanji had refused Big Mom's invitation, only to become excited at the thought of helping Luffy interfere with Sanji's marriage ceremony, which prompted Wanda to reprimand her for taking it so lightly. Later, Carrot partied alongside the Straw Hats and other minks.
The following day, as Bariete rang the bell and spoke of the arrival of
samurais
, Carrot and the rest of the minks rushed to Kurau City. When
Kin'emon
and
Kanjuro
revealed themselves, Carrot and the minks welcomed them and revealed that Raizo was on Zou before standing proudly at having kept his presence a secret.
Kin'emon showed Carrot and the other minks the crest of the
Kouzuki Family
on his back to confirm his allegiance. When Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reluctantly called a truce for the sake of
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, whom they recognized as their lord, Carrot and the rest of the minks were overjoyed.
After Inuarashi and Nekomamushi took Law, the Straw Hats, and the samurai to the Whale Tree, the minks discussed the day that the two rulers began hating each other, with Carrot noting that she had not even been born yet at the time. Happy that the two rulers finally made peace with each other, Carrot and the rest of the minks began to prepare a banquet to celebrate the occasion.
However, when Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, the samurais, and the pirates returned from the Whale Tree with Raizo, Zou began shaking as Zunesha started crying out, throwing Carrot and the others into a state of panic.
Jack had returned and was attempting to destroy Zou by killing Zunesha, who retaliated on Momonosuke's command and sank Jack's fleet with one blow, calming down Carrot and the others in the process.
Wanting to go on an adventure, Carrot later went down to the
Thousand Sunny
in secret in order to join the Sanji retrieval mission,
bribing Bariete with bananas not to tell anyone.
Carrot unexpectedly joins the Sanji retrieval team.
Carrot later revealed herself to the Sanji Retrieval Team after they had sailed far away from Zou, to their great surprise. As Carrot greeted everyone on the ship, Pedro tried to have the ship turned around so she could return to Zou, but Carrot begged them to let her come along and promised not to cause any trouble for the group. Luffy allowed her to come along because she was already on board, but despite her gratitude, Carrot immediately attacked him upon noticing that he was eating one of her carrots, only calming down when Luffy patted her head at Nami's behest.
Carrot and the rest of the Sanji Retrieval Team were surprised to learn of the
Blackbeard Pirates
' attack on the
Revolutionary Army
's headquarters on
Baltigo
. After the team passed through a storm, with Carrot mistaking lightning for
Electro
, Luffy presented his cooking, which Carrot and the group found to be completely inedible. Luffy then revealed that he had used up all of the food they had, leaving the team in a food shortage crisis.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Marine Rookie Arc
[
]
Carrot and Luffy sneak into a Marine base to eat.
Hungry from the lack of food on their voyage, Carrot was excited when the team approached
Fron Island
, despite finding out it was home to a
Marine
base. She, Luffy, Nami, Chopper, and Brook infiltrated the island, knocked some Marines unconscious, and stole their clothes. They then plotted to sneak into a food warehouse, but Carrot and Luffy walked into a cafeteria in the main base instead. They feasted on the food served to them, and when Nami and Chopper caught up to them, Carrot greeted them loudly, much to their chagrin. When Luffy's identity was discovered and broadcast by
Vice Admiral Prodi
, he and Carrot were confronted by the Marines in the cafeteria.
Carrot knocks out Zappa with Electro.
When Luffy noticed that he was surrounded by Marines, Carrot asked him what they should do, but Luffy couldn't care less about the Marines and instead replied that they should eat more, much to Carrot's surprise, but she joined Luffy anyway and ate more curry. After Luffy's brief scuffle with
Grount
and
Bonham
, Carrot and Luffy fled the cafeteria.
Zappa
stopped them in the hallway and, having taken a liking to Carrot, gave the rabbit mink a bouquet of carrots. Carrot then gave Zappa a garchu greeting, making him briefly faint from happiness. When Carrot and Luffy started running again, Zappa quickly got back on his feet and fought Luffy until he was subdued by Carrot's Electro. They then ran into Brook's soul form, which scared Carrot, and led them to the food storage house, defeating some Marine soldiers along the way.
At the food storage house, Carrot and the group gathered as much food as they can carry, but they were once again confronted by Grount, Bonham, and Zappa. After Carrot hit Zappa with another Electro, Zappa declared his love for both Nami and Carrot. In response, Nami used Thunder Breed Tempo on him. After exiting the storehouse with the food, they watched Luffy battling Grount. After Grount was overpowered, Carrot and her group prepared to depart the island. However, before they reached the Thousand Sunny, they were confronted by Vice Admiral Prodi.
The group tried to escape to the Submerge, but Prodi shot his bazooka at it before confronting them. The Sanji retrieval team dodged one of his bazooka blasts, and Carrot and Nami attacked the Marines but found that their electric attacks were unable to work against the Marines' rubber shields. However, they dispatched the Marines with physical attacks, and after Luffy defeated Prodi, Bonham, and Zappa, the team tried to escape to the still-intact Submerge. Luffy was confronted by Grount, and he told the group to go on ahead while he fought. Luffy eventually defeated Grount, and the group sailed away from Fron Island on the Thousand Sunny. However, the food they had stolen was eaten within 10 minutes.
Concludes non-canon section.
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
A few days later, Carrot and the rest of the group were famished from the lack of food and overheated as they passed through boiling waters but were saved from starvation when Luffy managed to catch a gigantic fish. After Luffy succumbed to food poisoning due to eating the fish's toxic skin, Carrot and the others enjoyed a meal prepared by Nami using Sanji's recipe. As they entered Big Mom's territory, the group was approached by a ship belonging to
Germa 66
.
Upon seeing a hooded man aboard the ship, Carrot mistook him for Sanji until he revealed himself to be Sanji's younger brother,
Vinsmoke Yonji
, which Carrot was shocked at Nami deducing. As Luffy's condition worsened, Yonji refused to provide any aid and taunted the group to try to take the antidote by force, prompting Carrot to tearfully note that he was nowhere near as kind as Sanji was. When Sanji's older sister,
Vinsmoke Reiju
, appeared aboard the Thousand Sunny, Carrot angrily demanded to know who she was, only to watch in shock as Reiju sucked the poison out of Luffy's body, saving his life. With Carrot and Chopper overjoyed at Luffy's recovery, the Vinsmoke siblings and their men departed without reporting the Sanji Retrieval Team's presence.
The Sanji Retrieval Team as guests in Pudding's home.
The group later docked at
Cacao Island
, an island close to
Whole Cake Island
, and Carrot and Nami changed into new outfits. When Carrot noticed people from different races living on the island, Pekoms explained Big Mom's dream of creating a nation where people from all races can live together. Seeing buildings made from chocolate, Carrot asked if the chocolate could be eaten, prompting Pekoms to reveal that it is illegal to consume the roofs because they protect residents against the precipitation the island receives. She and the rest of the Sanji Retrieval Team witnessed Luffy and Chopper getting into trouble for eating a café and subsequently being saved by the arrival of
Charlotte Pudding
, who came to their defense. After Pudding bailed out Luffy and Chopper, Carrot and the team accompanied her to her home, where she fed them.
Carrot and the rest of the team discovered that Pudding was Sanji's betrothed, and Pudding told them how she met Sanji and became attracted to him, which caused Carrot to quickly warm up to her because of their shared admiration for him. After Pudding gave them a route to Whole Cake Island and promised to bring Sanji to them, the team left Pudding's home in a hurry when guards came for her. Upon returning to the Thousand Sunny, they discovered that Pekoms had gone missing and there was a message in the bathroom telling them to turn back.
The Sanji Retrieval Team battles a centipede at sea.
After leaving Cacao Island, Carrot and the rest of the team sailed through Pudding's route. Carrot and Chopper were excited when they approached the next
island
on the route, but Nami decided not to dock at it. After asking to help with lookout duty, Carrot saw a grape-colored part of the ocean, which prompted Pedro to reveal that there were juice rivers coming from the islands. Suddenly, a giant sea centipede attacked the ship, and Carrot began to battle it alongside Luffy, Pedro, and Brook.
Later, Carrot and the team battled a swarm of giant ants as night fell, and consequently got stuck in a frozen sea of syrup. As they worked to melt the syrup, Luffy asked Pedro about his previous experience in
Totto Land
, which prompted Carrot to reveal that Pedro was once a pirate who sailed with Pekoms. Pedro explained his pirating history and how he met his defeat in Totto Land, which Carrot did not know about. The next morning, the team arrived at Whole Cake Island, which Carrot was excited to see.
Pedro and
Brook
departed to find Big Mom's
Road Poneglyph
, and Carrot, Luffy, Nami, and Chopper went ashore to look for Sanji and Pudding. Carrot, Luffy, and Chopper saw what appeared to be Sanji leaning against a tree, but to their surprise, he disappeared. They entered the Seducing Woods to look for Sanji but were frequently distracted by the sweets making up their surroundings. They were nearly eaten by a
talking crocodile
, but it walked away when it saw that most of them were humans. Suddenly, Luffy confronted a
reflection of himself
, shocking Carrot, Nami, and Chopper. Carrot thought she saw Sanji lying on a tree branch, but this version of him disappeared as well, and everyone except Luffy chased after a fleeing figure. After running into a
large man
buried up to his head, they were suddenly attacked by a
rabbit
riding a bird, and as everyone was thrown into chaos, everything in the forest came to life to trap and kill the pirates.
Carrot clashes with Randolph.
As Carrot, Chopper, and Nami ran, Randolph continued to pursue them. Carrot informed them that despite Randolph's appearance, he was not a mink. She then clashed with Randolph and used Electro against him, which he was unable to do, confirming her words. Carrot then knocked out the crane he was riding on. Randolph then leaped off the crane and hurled its spear at the pirates, who managed to dodge the projectile, which struck the buried large man instead. They went back to the two Luffys and the fake Luffy went with them while the real Luffy ran in the opposite direction. They tried to escape the Seducing Woods, but they kept running into the buried large man. The Sanji Retrieval Team got lost in the mirrored woods, and the Luffy accompanying them revealed herself to be the reflection, transforming back into her true form,
Charlotte Brûlée
. She then grabbed Nami and prepared to slice her and Carrot's faces.
Carrot trapped within Brûlée's mirror.
After Nami used her
Clima-Tact
to escape Brûlée's grasp, Carrot attempted to attack Brûlée using her "Eleclaw" technique, but Brûlée used her Devil Fruit power to reflect Carrot's attack back at her. Carrot tried to attack again, but Brûlée used her ability to trap Carrot into the
Mirro-World
.
Sometime later, Carrot was joined by Chopper. When Brûlée arrived at the scene where
Charlotte Cracker
was confronting Luffy and Nami, she smashed the mirror that Carrot and Chopper were trapped in. However, the two prisoners remained unharmed.
Inside the Mirro-World, a shackled Chopper told Carrot, also shackled, that he had a plan, and so she should call him "Brother Chopper". Carrot referred to him as "Choniki" and asked what the plan was. Chopper explained his realization that the Mirro-World is connected to every mirror on Whole Cake Island. Thus, instead of trying to escape, they should use Brûlée's power against her.
Eleven hours later, Carrot and Chopper were running from Brûlée inside the Mirro-World, but began to grow tired.
As they ran, Carrot and Chopper contacted Nami through a mirror shard and told her not to worry. However, their conversation ended abruptly.
Carrot kicks a pot of soup at Brûlée, defeating her.
Eventually, Brûlée caught them,
but Carrot and Chopper managed to acquire a frog that Brûlée had turned into a body double of Carrot with her powers. They tricked Brûlée into believing that the frog was Carrot, and Carrot followed them back to Brûlée's house, hiding in the attic and making cries of distress to continue the act. As Brûlée and her entourage prepared to lower the frog into a giant pot of boiling soup, Carrot threw a rock at Randolph before he could drop the frog into the pot. In the confusion, she then jumped down and kicked the pot at Brûlée, dousing her in the boiling soup and defeating her. Randolph and his comrades raced to help Brûlée, but Carrot cleverly used Electro on the soup, electrocuting all of them.
Diesel
ran away to report the incident to Big Mom, but Carrot chased him down and put her hands over his eyes, causing him to crash. Carrot and Chopper then celebrated their victory and prepared to use the mirror world to visit their allies.
Carrot and Chopper look for their teammates in Mirro-World.
With Brûlée as their prisoner, Carrot and Chopper raced through the Mirro-World using Diesel to find Luffy and the others.
Carrot managed to revive Brûlée by tickling her, and Brûlée revealed that the mirrors could talk to them. Carrot and Chopper asked the mirrors about their teammates, but the mirrors did not know what they looked like, so Carrot prepared to draw portraits of them.
Carrot and Chopper located Pedro and made a plan for him to end his battle with
Tamago
. As Pedro blew up a large amount of explosives inside his jacket, Carrot and Chopper pulled him into the Mirro-World. As they continued traveling in the Mirro-World, Carrot and Chopper were informed of Luffy and Nami's capture but were later told by the mirrors that Nami was with
Jinbe
.
They located Nami and Jinbe and helped them escaped their pursuers by pulling them into the Mirro-World. With Nami and Jinbe in the group, the team went on searching for Luffy, Brook, and Sanji.
Carrot's group located Brook inside Big Mom's bedroom, being held in her hands as she slept. Brûlée tried to alert her mother, causing the team to bind and gag her and Diesel. Upon witnessing Big Mom and her three
homies
attacking a fly, the team became terrified, wondering how they were supposed to save Brook. The team then made a skeletal lookalike for Brook, which they planned to use to make a stand-in for the real Brook. After Chopper's unsuccessful attempt to retrieve Brook, Carrot tried next, quietly landing on Big Mom before whispering to Brook to wake up. However, she was forced to flee from a sleep bubble coming from Big Mom's nose, and
Zeus
spotted her. Thinking she was the fly, Zeus shot a lightning bolt at Carrot. After Jinbe and Nami rescued Brook from Big Mom's clutches, the team was surprised to see that Brook successfully copied the
poneglyphs
and hid the copies inside his skull. The team then celebrated Brook's accomplishment.
The Sanji Retrieval Team forms an alliance with the Fire Tank Pirates.
The group searched for Sanji and Luffy, but none of the mirrors saw them inside the castle. Nami then theorized where Sanji and Luffy may be at and Carrot was surprised to hear that the two had a fight.
Carrot's group later contacted Luffy and Sanji through a mirror shard and were surprised when Luffy decided to ruin the wedding ceremony. Carrot then listened as Jinbe explained more about the situation they were in, about Bege, his backstory, his plot against Big Mom and his suggestion to form an alliance.
After Luffy agreed to meet with the
Fire Tank Pirates
to form an alliance to take down Big Mom, Carrot and her group arrived at Bege's hideout before Luffy and Sanji. After taking a bath with Nami, she accompanied her team inside the meeting room where an argument broke out among Luffy, Caesar, and Bege until Jinbe settled it.
As Bege explained his plan to kill Big Mom, Carrot listened attentively. The meeting adjourned once Bege finished going over the plan.
Bege transported the alliance members to the wedding inside his body. Before Bege walked into the wedding venue, Carrot was shown sleeping.
After the wedding ceremony began, the team initially encountered a small problem when Jinbe had difficulty waking Luffy up. After they woke Luffy with meat, the team went into the Mirro-World and prepared to charge into the venue. Once they heard the signal, the team unleashed duplicates of Luffy into the venue, causing chaos at the ceremony.
After releasing all the duplicates, the team charged in. Carrot, Nami, and Chopper then hid inside the ruined wedding cake, waiting for the photo of
Mother Carmel
to be destroyed. They then watched in amazement as Jinbe without fear officially declared to Big Mom his intention to leave the Big Mom Pirates in order to join the Straw Hat Pirates and that Luffy would become the Pirate King.
Three seconds after Brook destroyed Carmel's portrait, Carrot, Nami, and Chopper were confused as to why Big Mom did not already start screaming. However, they were later told by Bege to put on their earplugs as he initiated his assassination operation.
Carrot and Nami help Sanji rescue his family.
Once Luffy caused Big Mom to start her strange scream, Carrot's group came out of hiding and assisted Sanji in rescuing the
Vinsmoke Family
.
Carrot then watched as Bege,
Vito
, and
Gotti
fired their
KX Launchers
at Big Mom. However, Big Mom's scream detonated the rockets before they could reach her. With the assassination attempt a failure, Caesar flew into the venue with the escape mirror and Bege signaled the alliance members to retreat. Before they could escape into the mirror, Big Mom's scream shattered it, leaving them trapped in the venue. After Bege transformed into
Big Father
, he instructed the alliance to retreat inside.
Before she could do so, Carrot watched as Nami was caught by
Smoothie
, before being restrained herself by
Daifuku
's
genie
. However, she was released after Yonji attacked the genie. Carrot then retreated successfully into Bege's fortress, along with the rest of the alliance. However, they found themselves in a dire situation as Big Mom began attacking the fortress.
As Bege's fortress continued to suffer damage from Big Mom's attacks, Luffy attempted to fight back only to be reminded they have achieved their goals. Carrot then listened to Bege as he came up with a plan to escape with Caesar's help, and also when Sanji demanded his father to never appear before him and his friends ever again.
Just when the Big Mom Pirates routed the Straw Hats, the Fire Tanks, and the Vinsmokes, the
Tamatebako
dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and exploded, causing the castle to topple over.
As the castle collapsed, Carrot's group, Bege's crew, and the Vinsmoke Family got away. Carrot's group and the Fire Tank Pirates rendezvous at the northwest part of Whole Cake Island, where Bege decided to part ways with the Straw Hats.
The Sanji Retrieval Team clashes with the Big Mom Pirates while escaping.
After Brook and Chopper separated from the group to retrieve the
Shark Submerge III
,
the rest head for the Thousand Sunny. As they approached the Seducing Woods, they ran into
Kingbaum
. Nami then used part of Big Mom's
Vivre Card
to control Kingbaum and forced him to transport the fleeing team. However, before they reached the Seducing Woods, a crazed Big Mom (while riding on Zeus) caught up to them.
Using
Napoleon
in its sword form, Big Mom unleashed an air slash that cut off a part of Kingbaum. As Big Mom prepared to attack again, Nami diverted Zeus' attention by using thunderclouds, causing the cloud homie to veer off-course and drop Big Mom. When Carrot and her group reached the Seducing Woods, Big Mom ordered the tree homies to stop the Straw Hats, but Kingbaum charged through them. Carrot and her group were later forced to jump off Kingbaum when
Prometheus
attacked and burned Kingbaum for his betrayal.
As the Sanji Retrieval Team continued with their escape, Big Mom resumed her pursuit. Thanks to Big Mom's presence, the Vivre Card in Nami's possession was rendered useless, and the Seducing Woods homies went to work attacking the Straw Hats and changing the landscape to confuse them. Several Big Mom Pirates caught up to their captain and clashed with the Sanji Retrieval Team. Along the way, Luffy stopped Carrot from separating from the group. The team pulled out of the conflict quickly, knowing they could not split up there. When Zeus ate one of Nami's weather eggs and grew massively and became stormy, Nami took the opportunity to summon a massive lightning bolt that struck the Big Mom Pirates pursuing them.
Nami's attack left Big Mom laying at the bottom of a crater. To the Straw Hats' shock, Big Mom was barely affected and continued to move. She ate through the ground as she moved back up, and the team started running again. They were then approached by Pudding and
Chiffon
. After Chiffon requested Sanji's help in making a cake for Big Mom, Sanji readily agreed to assist them. Big Mom then got back on her feet and unleashed another devastating air slash, and the two groups parted ways, with Sanji heading to Cacao Island with Pudding and Chiffon while Carrot and her group continued fleeing to the Thousand Sunny. Pudding used
her Devil Fruit powers
to send memories flooding into the souls in the homies, allowing the Straw Hats to make it to the coast without trouble.
Carrot is subdued by Katakuri.
They ran toward the Sunny and came into conflict with
Perospero
and
Katakuri
, who were already on board. Pedro told Carrot not to be flustered by these events, as he believed that the Straw Hats would bring about the
dawn of the world
. After Perospero trapped the Sunny in
candy
, Carrot watched in shock as Pedro attempted to take out Perospero with a massive suicidal explosion.
Carrot then cried out and was about to go to the coast to get Pedro. Nami stopped her from leaving the ship, saying that they could not afford to waste the chance that Pedro provided them. Carrot then tried to attack Katakuri, but the Sweet Commander easily subdued her. After Luffy grabbed Katakuri and dragged him into the Mirro-World, Carrot and her group on the Thousand Sunny successfully escaped Whole Cake Island with a Coup de Burst.
As the team mourned Pedro's self-sacrifice and lamented on their inability to save him, Jinbe encouraged them to press on and keep their guard up. As the team was spurred into action, Carrot jumped up to the crow's nest and saw not only the Big Mom Pirates' fleet heading toward them but Big Mom herself, who was walking on water using Perospero's candy road. Upon seeing Perospero standing on top of Big Mom, Carrot gazed at him with a furious expression.
The Sanji Retrieval Team plan their next move.
While under siege by the Big Mom Pirates, Carrot informed Nami of another predicament, which was Big Mom creating a massive wave homie to engulf the Thousand Sunny.
As the wave homie got closer, Carrot apologized to Pedro how she and her friends would not be able to escape even after his sacrifice, but thanks to Jinbe's skills as a
helmsman
, the team managed to come out of that situation unharmed. They then contacted Luffy through a mirror shard and told him to find a mirror connecting to
Cacao Island
so they could meet him there.
On the way to Cacao Island, the group on the Sunny was puzzled when they saw no pursuers. Carrot and Chopper kept a vigilant lookout.
As they were getting near Cacao Island, Carrot noted that a full moon was coming.
Carrot activates her Sulong form and attacks the Big Mom Pirates.
The group on the Sunny was later surprised to find themselves once again pursued by Big Mom and a fleet of Tarteships.
They were initially able to hold their own, but they later discovered another fleet of Tarteships led by
Charlotte Daifuku
in front of them. As they were about to be surrounded by the Big Mom Pirates, they thought about a counterattack. Carrot told the rest of the team to leave this to her, and she activated her Sulong form by the power of the full moon. She swooped down and glided toward Daifuku's ship, where she rapidly attacked several Big Mom Pirates who could not keep up with her movements. She then went to the helm and destroyed it, preventing Daifuku's crew from piloting it.
Enraged at Carrot's actions, Daifuku summoned a genie to attack Carrot. Carrot dodged the genie's strikes, causing it to damage the ships in Daifuku's fleet instead. Carrot continued her attack by destroying the helms of the other ships. Just when she was feeling fatigued from using the Sulong form, Brook arrived and grabbed her. Carrot then blocked her eyes from the moonlight and returned to her original form as Brook carried her back to the Thousand Sunny.
Carrot rested inside the Sunny as the rest of the team fought against Big Mom.
As the Sunny was pursued by Smoothie's fleet after the Fire Tank Pirates lured Big Mom away, Carrot recovered from her exhaustion. She then asked the rest of the Sunny group if Luffy had won his battle.
As the promised rendezvous time drew near, Nami pointed out that Luffy needed Brûlée in order to leave the Mirro-World, causing the group to become concerned, given Luffy's absent-mindedness. With a few minutes remaining, Cacao Island was in sight.
As the Sunny group sailed past the port of Cacao Island, they were overjoyed to see Sanji and Luffy coming towards them.
Luffy and Sanji returned to the Sunny and the group quickly made their retreat from Cacao Island. The group was then besieged by Smoothie's fleet, but Judge came to their rescue. After the Sunny passed by Judge's castle, the group later saw enemy ships approaching them from the front and Daifuku tried to attack Carrot with his genie, but Sanji blocked it. When the situation grew more dire, they were surprised when Wadatsumi appeared and attacked the enemy.
The Sun Pirates cleared a path for the Sunny. However, despite their efforts, the Sunny was intercepted and attacked by the Queen Mama Chanter.
Wadatsumi saved the Sunny by switching it with the Sun Pirates' ship and hid the Sunny in his mouth. Wadatsumi tried swimming away, but Oven attacked him with heatwaves, forcing him to spit out the Sunny. As the Sun Pirates held back the Big Mom Pirates, Jinbe decided to stay behind to help them and Luffy consented to his decision. After Jinbe joined his former crew in battle, the Sunny group sailed far away from Cacao Island.
After escaping from Totto Land, Sanji learned about Pedro's self-sacrifice and expressed some regrets. Carrot tried to cheer Sanji up but ended up crying, prompting Sanji to comfort her. Later, the group on the Sunny happily waited for Sanji's cooking.
Levely Arc
[
]
Carrot and the Straw Hat Pirates shocked after seeing Luffy's new reward.
Carrot received a new newspaper and showed it to the group. They looked at the new bounty posters for Sanji and Luffy and the group was shocked to learn that Luffy's bounty increased to
1,500,000,000.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
As the Thousand Sunny continued towards Wano Country, the group was informed of the Levely through a newspaper. They later encountered an unusual weather disturbance in their direction, followed by an octopus on their ship as well as a school of huge carp on their side. After a bumpy ride across a river, the ship climbed up a waterfall. Once they reached the top, they came across a whirlpool.
Sanji carried Nami, Chopper, Carrot, and Brook away from the ship, but Luffy got dragged into the whirlpool along with the Sunny.
After Luffy got separated, the group searched for him, but they only found his Vivre Card. They later got in touch with Kin'emon and they reunited with Luffy at the ruins of Oden Castle. With Law, Momonosuke, and Kiku also present, Kin'emon explained how he and his group traveled through time to escape Orochi's attack twenty years ago.
Carrot then listened as Kin'emon explained more about the past such as the story of Oden, the time of his execution, the rumor about Toki, and what Kin'emon's group did right after arriving at the present time. Kin'emon then went over a plan to attack Onigashima, the island where Kaidou resided, in two weeks.
The Sanji Retrieval Team receives appropriate clothing for Wano thanks to Kin'emon's powers.
Kin'emon explained more about the Fire Festival and how the decisive battle would play out. He then gave the group specific tasks to do. He asked Carrot and Chopper to go with Kiku to Inuarashi's current location. After giving the group new clothes, he introduced them to
Shinobu
. When Kaidou arrived at Kuri, Law alerted the group.
The group was surprised to see Kaidou and they learned that Luffy, Zoro, and Law were already exposed. Luffy rushed off to protect
Okobore Town
and Law chased after him and told the rest to remain unseen. After Kin'emon and Kiku left to rescue Tsuru, the rest at Oden Castle noticed Kaidou coming to their direction and tried to flee as Kaidou destroyed the castle with a fire breath.
Sanji carried Carrot and Nami away while Shinobu saved the rest by using her Devil Fruit power to sink them into the ground. Kiku then returned and told them what happened to Luffy.
At Mt. Atamayama, Carrot witnessed
Ashura Doji
's clash with Inuarashi. After Kin'emon broke up the fight, Carrot was amazed that Ashura was an even match for Inuarashi.
Sometime later, Carrot and the Musketeers stole food and weapons from the Beasts Pirates and left a note saying that Ashura and his gang were responsible for the thefts.
At an abandoned village in Kuri, Carrot panicked after hearing that the Beasts Pirates found out about Kin'emon's secret message.
Prior to the raid on
Onigashima
, Carrot, Wanda, and Shishilian were later at the place where graves for Pedro and
Yasuie
were placed.
In Amigasa Village, Carrot marveled at the new armor Luffy, Brook, and Chopper received. After Robin stated that Onigashima's entrance is in winter, Carrot explained to the group that the seasons are not consistent in Wano and cold climate would give the minks an advantage.
Carrot and the straw hats excited to see Jinbe again.
On the day of the Fire Festival, Carrot joined the Straw Hats on the Thousand Sunny as they entered the battle with the Beasts Pirates.
Kanjuro fled the scene with Momonosuke in tow on a drawn crane and briefly attacked the alliance with an ink cloud that rained down ink arrows. Momonosuke ordered the alliance to press forward to Onigashima without worrying about him. As the alliance was attacked by a Beasts Pirates ship with long ranged cannons, Jinbe came to aid the rebels. Like the Straw Hats, Carrot was also happy to see Jinbe again.
After the Straw Hats defeated the guards at the torii gates, the alliance arrived at Onigashima.
After disembarking, Carrot received a Beasts Pirates disguise from Kin'emon. She then joined Chopper, Usopp, Nami, and Shinobu in the
Brachio Tank V
.
The group in the tank and Kin'emon's forces reached the Pleasure Hall owned by
Black Maria
. Carrot, Shinobu, and Nami volunteered to go look for Momonosuke.
After they separated from Kin'emon's forces and the Brachio Tank V, they ran into
Prometheus
.
The three quickly fled from the homie as it called Big Mom.
However, Carrot, Nami, and Zeus were later captured and taken to the Live Stage.
When Big Mom encountered Luffy during the raid, Nami and Carrot freed themselves from the homies holding them, as Nami used her Sorcery Clima-Tact and Carrot used the Electro-based attack Eleclaw.
Carrot and Wanda are defeated by Perospero.
When Carrot spotted
Marco
and Perospero meeting with Big Mom, she decided to go after Perospero to avenge Pedro's death.
After transforming into their Sulong forms, Carrot and Wanda attacked Perospero and wounded him.
Despite their incredible power, Carrot and Wanda were defeated after they lost their Sulong transformation when the moon got covered by clouds.
After the two recovered later, they spotted the Sulong-transformed
Nekomamushi
arrive to fight Perospero.
Though they were worried when the storm clouds blocked off the full moon causing Nekomamushi to revert back and get badly injured by Perospero, once the clouds parted due to the clashing of advanced-grade
Supreme King Haki
, Nekomamushi was able to regain his Sulong form and swiftly defeated Perospero with
Oden One Sword Style: Neko Niko Ban
.
After this she goes to hug Nekomamushi, where he tells her to be careful not to transform into sulong because the moon has been seen again.
Suddenly,
Onigashima
begins to move, so she, Nekomamushi, and Wanda decide to head back to the castle so they do not fall.
Once inside, they joined the resurging battle against the Beasts Pirates, who once again started to fight the Alliance's forces.
Carrot celebrates Wano's victory with the rest of the Mokomo Dukedom.
After the raid concluded, Carrot was among the the spectators in the alliance watching Kouzuki Momonosuke being announced as the next Shogun of Wano. Carrot was smiling at the news of Momo now becoming the shogun.
A week later, after Luffy and Zoro finally woke up, Carrot joined the other women in a bath
and later she joined in celebrating the festival in the Flower Capital.
After the festival, while she was eating, Carrot was informed by both Inuarashi and Nekomamushi that they were stepping down from their positions as the rulers of the
Mokomo Dukedom
to remain in Wano and had decided to appoint Carrot as the next ruler due to her previous journey with the Sanji Retrieval Team and her experience of seeing the world being necessary for the new era. Though Carrot was shocked by this decision, as there were other minks more qualified than her, the two reminded her that she possesses the same
will
that Pedro once had.

Translation and Dub Issues

The nickname that Carrot had given to Chopper, "Choniki" (a combination of the words "Chopper" and "brother"), has been translated as "Chobro" in the English version.
