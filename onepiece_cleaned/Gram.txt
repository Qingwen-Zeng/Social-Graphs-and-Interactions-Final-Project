When
Nico Olvia
set out with her exploration team to search for
Poneglyphs
, Gram was selected as a candidate to join the team, though she ultimately remained on
Ohara
due to her age.
For the penalty of studying the forbidden Poneglyph, the

were "demons" for attempting to destroy the world, and had

island's destruction
when the Tree of Knowledge burned down with her inside trying to save as many books as she could.
