Disco
is the owner of the now-bankrupt
Human Auctioning House
at Grove 1 in
Sabaody Archipelago
.
Appearance
[
]
Before the timeskip, Disco was a thin, eccentric man who had long silver hair, a cleft chin, stubble beard and mustache. He wore a purple coat, pink scarf, a tall yellow hat with flower patterns around the bottom, and his trademark star-shaped glasses.
After the timeskip, Disco has lost his business and has become ragged-looking, with torn clothes and a scruffy beard and hairstyle. He now wears torn black boots and a ripped shirt and shorts. However, he still maintains his hat and glasses, the former which crumpled inward.
Personality
[
]
He is a sadistic person, who abused and kicked
Camie
when she was first brought to him.
He is extremly easy to anger, as he fell into a fit of absolute rage from a harmless gesture like Camie sticking her tongue out at him.
After the fall of the human shop, he seems to have fallen to ruin and become unable to move on, resorting to alcohol. He also seems to have developed a grudge towards the
Worst Generation
who were present at the day of the Human Shop's end, as he stabbed the wanted posters of Luffy, Kid, Law, and Rayleigh with knives.

went to save Camie. He was the one who presented the slaves to the buyers.

Luffy
and the Straw Hat Pirates made he was seen furious.
When

broke his chains with
Haki
, he used Haki to knock out the rest of the soldiers in the auction, including Disco.
He was later seen injured (the anime showing it was
Shalria
that caused it when Disco was inquiring about payment for Camie during the chaos), calling the shop's owner,
Warlord of the Sea
Donquixote Doflamingo
for help. However, the Warlord told Disco that he could have the shop and never to call again, as Doflamingo wasn't interested in it anymore, and that the future was in
SMILEs
; he also mentioned that the government was calling the Seven Warlords to battle against the
Whitebeard Pirates
, much to Disco's horror.
