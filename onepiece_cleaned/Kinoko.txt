is a former prisoner on
Level 5
of
Impel Down
and is currently a member of the
Buggy Pirates
, joining after his escape from Impel Down and the
Summit War of Marineford
.
Appearance
[
]
Kinoko is a very large, corpulent man, with tan skin, a round nose, small eyes, a large mouth, and a predominant lower lip. For the size of his abdomen, he has rather short, skinny limbs. He also has brown hair that comes to a peak at the top. He wears a standard prisoner suit with black and white horizontal stripes.
Personality
[
]
When he was locked in
Level 5
of
Impel Down
, Kinoko was negative to any possibility of running away from the Great Prison. He tried to convince
Luffy
to accept his death, stating that wanting to save someone else is just an absurdity.
After being freed, he was revealed to still be wary of strong opponents, like
Marshall D. Teach
.
Kinoko is also gullible, believing
Buggy
to be a powerful savior because he stood up to directly addressed two
Emperors
when, in reality, Buggy was a friend of emperor Shanks.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Kinoko was recognized by the other inmates on
Level 5
of
Impel Down
as a very powerful man, so much so that he was considered the boss of their cell.
Furthermore, since he was kept on a floor where only those prisoners with a bounty of
100,000,000 and higher were locked up, this further confirms his power.
During the
Summit War of Marineford
,
Whitebeard
commented on how strong
Buggy
's convict followers were, deciding not to make enemies of them during the conflict. Being recognized by an
Emperor
like Whitebeard is a testament to the prisoners' strength, of which Kinoko was included.

Ace
and told him that he should only care about himself. He and the other prisoners escaped after
Bentham
saved Luffy and left behind the cell keys.
Following Luffy and the other escapee leaders, Kinoko witnessed Blackbeard crush
Hannyabal
under his foot.
Marineford Arc
[
]
At
Marineford
, Kinoko was seen among the prisoners following Buggy, all of whom were in admiration of their new leader for speaking directly to Whitebeard.
Toward the end of the
conflict
, Kinoko and the others were shocked to see a
submarine
appear from the waters.
After
Shanks
arrived, Buggy yelled at the
Emperor
just like he had in their younger days under
Roger
. Kinoko and the others were so impressed that they declared they would follow him forever.
