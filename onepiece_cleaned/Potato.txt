Sabaody Archipelago
, he wore a white shirt with a black rabbit head design and a leather vest.
Personality
[
]
Little is known of Potato's personality, but like many of Sorbet's residents, he appears to be loyal to
Bartholomew Kuma
. He was willing to leave the island and abandon his home to keep Kuma's daughter,
Bonney
, safe from the World Government.
He may be aggressive, as he was seen leading the Bonney Pirates during a raid.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Potato's overall abilities are unknown, but Conney stated that he, much like the other fishmongers of Sorbet, was quite formidable in a fight, saying that other pirates and sea beasts would run at the sight of his strength. Despite this, however, he is clearly no match for the strength of the
Blackbeard Pirates
.
Weapon
[

Potato carries a large sword on his back and has even been seen swinging it,
but his skill with the weapon is unknown.
History
[

Past
[
]
At some point, Potato joined the group of fishermen who cared for
Jewelry Bonney
during her time with
Sapphire Scales
.
When they were asked by
Conney
to accompany Bonney on her escape from the
World Government
's "protection" of her, Potato agreed to leave the island. After remodelling their fishing ship into a
pirate ship
, Potato and the other fishermen of Sorbet waited for Bonney at a port and quickly set sail when she arrived. Soon after, they witnessed Bonney taking down a pursuing
Alpha
and cheered for her.
This moment was the foundation and the start of the Bonney Pirates and their goal was to search for their captain's father and their friend, Kuma. Later they heard that Kuma appeared on an island so they disembarked and searched there, but unfortunately couldn't find him because he
teleported
away from the island.
