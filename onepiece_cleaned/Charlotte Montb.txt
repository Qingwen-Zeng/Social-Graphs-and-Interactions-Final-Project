Less than two hours before
Monkey D. Luffy
was scheduled to arrive at
Cacao Island
, Montb and his siblings stood guard at the only mirror left on the island and waited for the young pirate to burst out.
To their surprise, however, when it came time for Luffy to come out,
Pekoms
came out with a captured
Brûlée
, instead. After Pekoms was attacked by
Oven
, Luffy fell out from where Pekoms had hidden him. In response, Montb and his brother,
Chiboust
, surrounded the traitor and threatened to gouge out his eyes.
After the
Vinsmoke Family
and the
Germa 66
arrived, Montb attempted to shoot them, but soon realized that it was impossible to damage their modified bodies with normal weapons. Later, when Brûlée revealed that their elder brother
Katakuri
had been defeated by Luffy, Montb responded in shock.
