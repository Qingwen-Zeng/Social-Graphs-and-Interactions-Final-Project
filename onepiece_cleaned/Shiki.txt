Shiki the Golden Lion
, also known as the
"Flying Pirate"
,
is the
admiral
and
helmsman
of the
Golden Lion Pirates
.
He is also a former member of the
Rocks Pirates
and the first known
prisoner to have ever escaped from
Impel Down
.
Shiki wreaked havoc on the seas during
Roger
's time, having commanded the largest
pirate
fleet
of that period. Considered one of Roger's greatest rivals, Shiki desired to conquer the
world
.
He is the main antagonist of
One Piece Film: Strong World
.
Appearance
[
]
Shiki is a very tall elderly man dressed in traditional Japanese clothes consisting of an orange trimmed, a red and black kimono robe tied together with a dark green sash, and a golden chain around his waist; he also wears a yellow striped tattered
haori
coat draped over his shoulders. He has golden mane-like hair, reaching down to the ground, and on the top of his head is part of a steering wheel that got lodged into his head after his battle with Roger. The doctor has noted that trying to remove it could result in death, as it is lodged too deep. Shiki himself thought he looked like a rooster without realizing that it was himself when looking into a mirror.
As for his facial features, he sports a golden bushy tuft of hair for a beard at the bottom of his chin, and a black goatee with pointed edges surrounding his mouth. His eyebrows are dark and pointed as well, and he has some purple spots on the left side of his face right around his right eye that indicates his age. He is usually seen smoking a cigar.
Twenty years ago, his hair covered the now bald top part of his head, and the coat on his shoulders had a different pattern, with big flower-like motifs on it.
Instead of using more conventional prosthesis after cutting off his own legs to escape Impel Down, he uses his own swords as prosthetic legs, which he openly shows.
Personality
[
]
Shiki is an ambitious man with a strong desire to rule the world, believing that, together with
Roger
, he could have easily done so. He values power, and respects those who have it, enemy or not. For this reason, he believed Roger being executed in the
East Blue
, the weakest of the Four Blues, was nothing short of humiliating considering the status the Pirate King had attained. According to
Garp
, he is not the type of person who could tolerate a peaceful era for long, but also added that Shiki would not instigate something big without extensive planning and preparation beforehand. This strongly implies that Shiki had the drive and mindset of a warmonger.
Shiki has a knack for planning, often coming up with grandiose ones that can be incredibly long-term, and even
Whitebeard
seems to warily view him in this regard. He is also usually a calm person at most times and upon being notified by Doctor Indigo that the development of the
SIQ
formula on the fauna of all sixteen floating islands would require a period of twenty years to accomplish, Shiki was completely happy to wait that long, indicating a high degree of patience and devotion to maintaining his plans. Occasionally though, his anger and wrath would cause him to perform reckless maneuvers that contradicted his cunning mentality.
Shiki was also shown to be a very charismatic and capable leader, managing to develop pirate armadas on at least two occasions in his career (the first was commented as being an exceptionally large fleet even in the
New World
; the
Whitebeard Pirates
division total is 1,600 pirates as a comparison, and the second looked to be nearly as large had Shiki not been stopped prematurely); he also treated his direct crew with compassion and respect, as if they were his own family, though he was not above killing lesser subordinates for the most superficial of reasons.
Shiki often comes off as very light-hearted and comical. He takes most things with a cheerful smile and even getting a steering wheel stuck in his head, losing half his Pirate
fleet
to Roger, or cutting off his feet did not bring him down much. The only thing Shiki has ever shown fear of are storms, possibly because his fleet was once devastated by one when battling the
Roger Pirates
, but more likely due to the fact that not even he has full control of his flying masses when in the midst of one. Shiki also seems to be a little bit absent-minded, as he often mistakes things for other things, such as a giant stormy cloud for a perm, a bird for a guitar, or
Scarlet
the gorilla for his grandmother. He apparently likes to dance, as when first introduced to
Nami
he was seen performing a dance with
Indigo
and Scarlet. The three of them often act as a comical trio.
Like other characters in One Piece, Shiki has a
distinct laugh
: "Jihahahaha"
(
ジハハハハ
?
)
.
In the English version of Strong World, he speaks with a Jamaican accent.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
By Shiki's own admission, he values his closest crewmates very much. This respect, however, does not seem to extend to the lower members of his fleet and will not hesitate to injure them if they do not live up to his expectations, as he was seen shooting one of them in a leg simply because he informed him of Roger's capture; he also shot one of his navigators for his incapability in forecasting weather conditions.
Scarlet, Shiki, and Indigo doing a skit.
Dr. Indigo
has spent over twenty years at Shiki's service, and the two engage as a comedic
manzai
duo alongside Scarlet, though their gags often fail to elicit any reaction before their audience. Shiki does not mind being slapped by the Doctor whenever he mistakes something for another thing, and he stands the noises of Indigo's shoes, despite them irritating him. He (along with everyone else) become completely surprised when they realize he can talk, despite the fact he spoke to them before. Whenever Shiki says or does something stupid, Indigo slaps him. Indigo also has a habit of trying to explain something to Shiki through odd movements and gestures until Shiki tells him to just come out and say it (though at one point in the movie, Shiki understood what he was trying to say, much to Indigo's surprise).
Shiki seems to be fond of
Scarlet
, since the gorilla is almost always seen at his side, and he even takes part in his and Indigo's comedic skits. He often mistakes Scarlet as a relative. Shiki admires both
Nami
's forecasting capabilities, having enlisted her as his crew's navigator, and her beauty, for which he refers to her as "Baby." After she betrayed him, however, he showed no hesitation in leaving her to die.
Enemies
[
]
Gol D. Roger
[
]
Shiki is one of the many pirates whose utmost respect had been gained by
Roger
. In fact, during their youth, the two Pirates flew into several skirmishes against each other due to their separate ideals (Shiki wanted to control it all, while Roger simply wanted to remain free), but in their last battle, Shiki was shown to be willing to treat the past as letting bygones be bygones, if Roger would just agree to form an alliance with him, and was even ready to work together with the Pirate King for his grand dream of conquest, offering to have the known world as spoils. However, Roger may not have regarded him, likewise, apparently having refused Shiki's hand of friendship many times in the past; the fact that Roger did not bother to at least talk with Shiki prior to his execution, as he had done with both Whitebeard and Garp, suggests that he did not think much of Shiki as a rival.
When Roger was "captured" by Marines, Shiki angrily invaded
Marineford
, saying that he should have killed him himself, and when in
Impel Down
, he thought of his old rival, showing sadness because of all the new rookies wanting to invade the
Grand Line
, and veterans like Roger dying.
World Government
[
]
Shiki is also a firm opposer of both the
World Government
and the Marines. Deemed the
Marines
of being too weak to capture a man like Roger. He was however defeated by
Sengoku
and
Garp
, and this may have caused him to hate the two as well. The first time he resurfaced to the world after 20 years he once again attacked the Marine Headquarters, "as a warning".
Sengoku viewed Shiki as his main enemy twenty years ago in the same sense that Garp viewed Gol. D. Roger. Shiki was also the "first" prisoner to escape from the great prison Impel Down, by cutting off his own shackled legs and later replaced them using his own personal swords as prosthetic limbs. Shiki's incident hurt the prison's pride as well as
Magellan
's, who was a vice warden at that time.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Twenty years after Indigo began creating his monstrous army, one of them,
Boss
, escaped, and Shiki attempted to recapture him by making an offer with
Largo
, the captain of the
Amigo Pirates
. If Largo could recapture Boss, he would be invited to become the commander of the Golden Lion Pirates' 51st division. Ultimately, Largo was defeated by
Monkey D. Luffy
and the entire Amigo Pirates were arrested at
Little East Blue
. Shiki, not knowing that Luffy was the one who defeated Largo, merely stated that this one setback would not upset his ultimate plan.
Continuing with his plans, Shiki continued to recruit powerful allies to accompany him in world domination, as well as to destroy East Blue, due to Shiki bearing a grudge to the sea for being Roger's death place. When he came across
Nami
, he noted on her exceptional navigational skills and beauty, and forced her to become a member of his crew by holding her comrades as hostage. Eventually, the rest of the
Straw Hat Pirates
attacked Shiki to retrieve Nami and to stop the Golden Lion Pirates from attacking East Blue.
Tony Tony Chopper
and
Nico Robin
went to destroy Indigo's laboratory where the SIQ drug was, to prevent any more mutant animals from being created, while the rest of the crew attacked Shiki's allies and palace. Nami tricked Shiki into guiding Merveille, now converted into a floating island fortress with Shiki's levitation powers, into a lightning storm, and with that, Luffy crashed a lightning-enhanced giant leg down onto Shiki and the floating island, defeating the Flying Pirate and sending the mutants plummeting into the sea.
Others
[
]
Rocks Pirates
[
]
Like most of the members of the
Rocks Pirates
, he has no bonds toward his crewmates and often got into conflicts with them.
Edward Newgate
[
]
Shiki and Whitebeard discuss Shiki's plans after his escape.
Before Roger’s era, they used to be part of the
Rocks Pirates
. Shiki often detested Whitebeard back then and even threatened to send him flying when Whitebeard tried to act like a leader. After the incident at God Valley, they went their separate ways to form their own respective crews.
Despite not apparently being an ally of him, Shiki did not have a bad relationship with
Whitebeard
. He thought of him as a strong man, able to take over Roger in the dominion of the sea, as he said when they were drinking together on the
Moby Dick
and speaking about old times. Whitebeard was apparently knowledgeable about Shiki's penchant for planning.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Shiki commanded a large pirate crew of at least 51 divisions,
somewhat similar to the
Krieg Pirates
and the
Whitebeard Pirates
, showcasing considerable military might. It is unknown how strong his crew was, but what is known is that the largest pirate fleet was under his control at that time.
During Roger's era, Shiki was one of the most powerful pirate figures of the time, being on par with Sengoku, Garp, Whitebeard, and Roger as a living legend. Before that era, Shiki was a member of the
Rocks Pirates
, a powerful crew whose members included three of the future
Emperors
and was notable enough to be known as a feared peer within the group.
He fought and stood his ground in a fight against
Garp
and
Admiral
Sengoku
at once, two of the most powerful Marines in existence, and their fight destroyed half the city, although he ended up being defeated, he came out with only a few bruises. Shiki is also the first prisoner to escape from
Impel Down
on his own without help. Whereas
Luffy
later had to enlist the help of
Ivankov
,
Jinbe
,
Crocodile
, and over two hundred other prisoners to escape, his feat remains unique in the history. Ultimately, Shiki was not seriously injured and was able to emerge practically unscathed from the prison, only losing his legs (which he cut off himself to free himself from the
Seastone
).
Physical Abilities
[
]
Alongside Roger and Whitebeard, Shiki is one of the most powerful pirates of his generation and showed incredible physical might. He had tremendous physical strength supplemented with his supreme sword skills, allowing him to slay an army of Marines alone at Marineford and fight both
Garp
and
Sengoku
.
After capture, he was imprisoned in Level 6 of Impel Down and survived in prison despite his injuries from the previous battle. He has a massive level of endurance as he could survive having parts of a steering wheel permanently embedded deep into his head, a feat that impressed Indigo, and an immense tolerance to pain. After he amputated his own legs to break free of
Seastone
shackles, Shiki was completely unfazed by the pain, even casually smoking a cigar as he joked around with
Hannyabal
. Without any medical treatment and with profuse and heavy bleeding, he successfully broke out of the impenetrable security defenses of Impel Down single-handedly. Later, in a crude form of emergency treatment, Shiki forcefully grafted his swords into the inner stumps of his amputated legs. Despite shedding even more blood, Shiki simply shrugged it off.
Even in old age, Shiki remained extremely powerful despite his strength having waned over time. He could block Sanji's kicks with one hand and negated Zoro's powerful slashes with his legs and sent him crashing to the ground with one crushing punch. He could fight on par with Luffy in his
Gear 2
mode and withstand several attacks in turn. He also withstood Chopper's Kokutei Roseo Metel with almost no damage at all.
Tactical Skills
[
]
Shiki was also considerably crafty and resourceful as a pirate, able to remain hidden from the World Government for 20 years despite his famed status while putting his plan into action. Within his compound, Shiki had a communication network set across his chain of floating islands to monitor general surface activity and had established a base of operations within Merveille to accommodate his vast armada for decades. Shiki also had access to the
SIQ
formula developed by his crewmate Doctor Indigo, with an entire laboratory located on Merveille dedicated to its further research.
Shiki was also shown to be a very charismatic and capable leader, managing to develop pirate armadas on at least two occasions in his career (the first was commented as being an exceptionally large fleet even in the New World; the Whitebeard Pirates division total is 1,600 pirates as a comparison, and the second looked to be nearly as large had Shiki not been stopped prematurely).
Swordsmanship
[
]
Shiki using his swordsmanship skills in conjunction with his Devil Fruit powers.
Shiki possesses tremendous skills in swordsmanship as he dual-wielded Oto and Kogarashi to single-handedly massacre an entire army of Marines before getting subdued by Garp and Sengoku.
After the two swords had become his prosthetic legs, not only did he have little difficulty in standing or walking while using them, but he is also capable of attacking from a distance with them by sending slashes from his sword legs in a
Rankyaku
-like fashion. These air-blades have a light-yellow/gold color-scheme, matching his epithet.
He also combines his sword skills with his Fuwa Fuwa no Mi, such as slashing open a body of water and then levitating it to drown his opponents. He fended off all the slashes from Zoro's
Nanajuni Pound Ho
with great speed and reflexes, and later another attack from Zoro's was countered in mid-air and he knocked Zoro back down to the ground with great force. He was also able to fight on par against Roger, and later, it took both Garp and Sengoku in their prime to capture him alive.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Main article:
Fuwa Fuwa no Mi
Shiki demonstrates his ability.
Shiki ate the Fuwa Fuwa no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
which allows him to fly, as well as make surrounding non-living matter levitate after he has come into contact with it.
Shiki states that once he makes something float, it will stay that way until either he himself undoes it or he loses consciousness. He has been shown to make several Marine vessels and even vast island areas float. However, his powers are unable to be used on any living matter other than himself, meaning he cannot levitate animals, plants, or other people.
He can telekinetically manipulate any weapons, structures, and debris that he has previously made contact with, allowing him to attack his opponents with multiple flying weapons and large heavy objects, as well as form a shield to defend himself from attacks. Additionally, his ability to fly grants him a very high level of mobility.
He can also use his power to freely manipulate his non-living surroundings, such as mineral, snow, and bodies of water. In addition to simply floating them, he can levitate them into intricate shapes, such as gigantic lion heads, which he can use to attack his opponents. His ability to levitate things can also be used to bind people in a vast amount non-living material, and even drown people by floating a large amount of water all around them.
Island Ship
[
]
Main article:
Island Ship
In the beginning segments of "Strong World", Shiki is revealed to have converted a small island into his personal flagship with the
Fuwa Fuwa no Mi
's powers. Because of this, apart from serving as the crew's captain, Shiki also acts as their
helmsman
and as such, any change in course of trajectory that must occur first has to be relayed by the crew to Shiki to conduct the change of direction.
Weapons
[
]
Main article:
Oto and Kogarashi
Shiki's swords.
Shiki possesses two double-edged swords by the names of
Oto and Kogarashi
, which according to him were famous. In the past, he used them like regular swords, but after escaping
Impel Down
, he replaced his severed legs with them. Despite the cumbersome appearance, Shiki has no trouble with his balance or walking capacity.
Flintlock
[
]
He was also seen using a
flintlock pistol
on various occasions and seems to be quite accurate with it.

Early History
[
]
Shiki arrives at God Valley alongside his crewmates.
Over 40 years ago he was a member of the legendary
Rocks Pirates
, along with future
Emperors
Whitebeard
,
Kaidou
, and
Big Mom
. 38 years ago, Shiki participated in the
God Valley Incident
alongside his crewmates, declaring that nobody gets in his way, lest they be blown aside.
At least 33 years ago, after the Rocks Pirates disbanded, Shiki formed his own crew, the
Golden Lion Pirates
.
The Battle at Edd War
[
]
Golden Lion Pirates vs. Roger Pirates.
Twenty-seven years ago, two years before
Gol D. Roger
and
his crew
reached
Laugh Tale
, Shiki had learned that Roger had located an
ancient weapon
. Seeing the opportunity, he asked Roger if they could
join forces
. With his large pirate fleet and Roger's knowledge of an ancient weapon, Shiki believed that together they could take over the whole
world
and asked Roger to become his right hand. Roger refused Shiki's offer, saying that there was no point in being a pirate if he could not do as he wished.
A great sea battle soon ensued between their crews at
Edd War
. Due to a storm that happened during their fight, Shiki unfortunately lost, and half of his fleet sunk. Despite this and getting a piece of a steering wheel lodged into his head that almost killed him, Shiki came to have great respect for Roger.
Imprisonment and Escape
[
]
Shiki about to fight Admiral Sengoku and Vice-Admiral Garp.
After hearing that Roger had been captured, Shiki shot the man who had informed him and went to
Marineford
on his own where he beat up several
Marine
soldiers. He yelled out how he could not believe how such "wimps" could have captured Roger and told them to bring him out if they had him so that he could kill him with his own hands. Shiki was suddenly approached by
Sengoku
, who explained that he would never have another fight with Roger as he could win and then be able to escape. Sengoku also explained that Roger was scheduled to be executed in
Loguetown
, "The Town of Beginnings", within a week and that the execution was meant to break the heart of every pirate. As Shiki lamented on the fact that the "Legend of the Pirate King, Roger" would end in the
weakest sea
and how it would be the greatest insult to him,
Monkey D. Garp
appeared and told him that East Blue was a symbol of peace while Sengoku explained that they would not let Shiki interfere in the execution. Both Garp and Sengoku prepared to fight, and a battle began between the three that destroyed half of Marineford's town. In the end, Shiki lost and was imprisoned in
Impel Down
.
Shiki laid broken in his cell and heard about how everyone was setting out to find
Roger's treasure
. He thought to himself that he would prove to the world how pirates were the rulers of the world. Twenty years ago, Shiki was considered the "first" prisoner to escape from the great prison Impel Down, by cutting off his own shackled legs and later replaced them using his own personal swords as prosthetic limbs.
He later sought out Whitebeard and offered him to be a part of his plan, although he was cut short as Whitebeard threatened to throw him overboard if he did not shut up. Shiki then revealed to Whitebeard that he would disappear for a while and that he would show the real fear of pirates to the rookie pirates. Shiki was then seen at a mountain on an unexplored
Grand Line
island. He asked Dr.
Indigo
how the experiment was coming and was told by Indigo that he had made a discovery that there was a balance between the plants and animals on the island. He also explained that many plants and animals could not be found elsewhere to which Shiki interrupted him. Shiki ordered him to get straight to the point, and asked Indigo how long would his plan take, and was told that it would take twenty years at least. Accepting this, Shiki said that he would then carry out his plan in 20 years, and then he would show "them" hell on Earth by releasing tons of mutated animals, declaring war to the world.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Little East Blue Arc
[
]
After 20 years had passed, Shiki was set to put his plan in motion. However, one of his animals, a large horned beetle, escaped from his base of operations. He contacted the
Amigo Pirates
and their leaders,
Largo
and
Corto
and offered to let them join his conference provided they retrieve the beetle for him. However, they failed thanks to the
Straw Hat Pirates
(though Shiki was unaware of this) and Shiki ultimately dismissed the escaped beetle, citing one escapee would not stop his plans.
One Piece Film: Strong World
[
]
During the years spent in
Merveille
, Indigo managed to develop from a local plant, the IQ, a serum called
SIQ
, that if injected into animals, it enhanced their evolutionary process, granting them the ability to adapt to their natural environment better. Using this incredible drug, Shiki started creating his own army of mutated animals in order to defeat the
World Government
. After gathering a large amount of these animals as well as old and new allies, Shiki sent some of them to attack East Blue, causing incredible damage. He then resurfaced to the world at Marineford, flying over the island with his ship and destroying several Marine battleships by levitating them and then crushing them to the ground, as a warning for his old enemies.
Shiki and the Straw Hats first meet.
After that, he came across the Straw Hats by chance.
Nami
felt the weather changing and warned everyone of a coming storm.
Monkey D. Luffy
called out to Shiki's ship, attempting to warn them, gaining Shiki's attention. Shiki sent down a
Tone Dial
to record the warning. His own navigators initially disagreed that a storm was approaching, but it did appear, and with Nami's direction, both ships successfully escaped it. Afterwards, Shiki shot his navigator and came down to the
Thousand Sunny
to meet Nami. There, he revealed his
Devil Fruit
power, the
Fuwa Fuwa no Mi
, which enabled him to make any inanimate object he touches ignore gravity and float. After learning it was Nami that delivered the warning and that they were heading to East Blue, Shiki offered to take them there and used his power on Sunny. However, it was all a deception: the Flying Pirate brought the Straw Hats up in the sky to his base, Merveille. There, he kidnapped Nami, wanting her as his navigator, and sent the others flying to the nearby islands levitated by his powers, as he prayed for his mutated animals.
Shiki asked Nami to become his navigator, but she refused. Dr. Indigo appeared with an 'evolved' bird called
Billy
that can generate electricity to show it to Shiki, but after being shocked by it, Shiki tossed it aside. Nami protected Billy, and the bird was left with her as Shiki and his men left.
Shiki confronting the Straw Hats.
After Nami escaped with Billy, Shiki chased her to the only village on the island, where she had taken refuge with some other members of the Straw Hats. The Golden Lion effortlessly defeated Luffy,
Roronoa Zoro
,
Usopp
,
Sanji
, and
Tony Tony Chopper
, trapping them in a giant pillar of earth with his powers, and eventually convinced Nami to join his crew, with the promise of sparing her former crewmates and East Blue. Usopp, the only remaining crew member conscious, tried to stop her, but Shiki knocked him out.
He gave Nami a Tone Dial in order to leave a last farewell to her friends before bringing her up again to his base. He had his allies witness the destruction of the village at the hands of his mutated animals as proof of their strength. After that, he was informed of something by Indigo which was revealed to be Nami's attempt to destroy the trees protecting his palace from the wild animals, in order for the place to be destroyed by his own bestial minions. Having seemingly foiled her plan, he had his subordinates immobilize her with long spears and left her to die from the Daft disease she contracted during her attempt to blow away the trees.
He summoned the pirates under his command to drink with him, explaining his plan. While preparing a
sakazuki ceremony
to swear in his fleet, and to toast to the commencement of the operation, the Straw Hats burst into the palace using the Sunny and then marched into the main meeting room brandishing various firearms. After a short confrontation where Shiki called them simply a suicide squad and revealed hundreds of men around them, Luffy said that Nami was simply the vanguard and that they were the main force. The Straw Hats unloaded their firearms in the room, defeating most of those gathered before splitting up to defeat the rest.
Luffy versus Shiki.
Luffy punched Shiki in the face and Shiki fled the room with Luffy chasing after him. After Nami and Billy destroyed the Daft Green, animals from outside stormed the palace, adding to the chaos within. Shiki was enraged and attempted to kill Nami, Usopp, and Chopper. However, Luffy appeared in
Gear 2
and started fighting him with the help of Billy. Luffy, still battling Shiki, was overwhelmed when Shiki surrounded him with water. Shiki then received a
Den Den Mushi
call warning of the storm and asking him to redirect the island which he did. Unknown to him, the call was in fact coerced by Usopp and Chopper and that Nami had led them directly into the storm. The various remaining pirates realized this and retreated, while the Straw Hats rigged the palace with explosives. Shiki returned to the palace and confronted them, but Luffy also reappeared, having recovered.
Shiki is defeated by Luffy.
Once more using
Gear 3
, Luffy placed his giant foot into the clouds, gaining an electric charge and used this to enhance his giant axe. Shiki at first thought that the lighting would kill Luffy, not realizing Luffy's rubber body would protect him. By the time Shiki realized his mistake, Luffy hit him with the attack, both smashing and electrifying him to the ground, defeating him and destroying an entire island in the process.
As he was beaten, Shiki questioned whether he was meant to be defeated once again by a man from East Blue before yelling Roger's name. With his defeat, the control his power held over the flying islands disappeared, forcing them to crash into the sea. Shiki was last seen falling unconscious into the sea as well, followed shortly by his subordinates Indigo and
Scarlet
. Apparently, the Marines spotted him and were hurrying to capture him, but it is unknown if they managed to.

Early Concepts
[
]
Early Shiki sketches.
In the early design sketches of Shiki, Oda originally drew Shiki as bald and with more lion-like facial features. In a later draft of Shiki, Oda drew him with the steering wheel but embedded in his head in a different position.
In an interview about
Strong World
, Oda also revealed that he originally intended this concept of Shiki to be used for
Bartholomew Kuma
. However, he turned down the idea but later decided to use it for Shiki.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
A notable difference between the anime and manga versions of
Episode 0
is that during the scene Shiki escapes Impel Down, his severed feet are barefooted in the manga, while in the anime, they keep the traditional Impel Down shoes.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
In the
Funimation
dub, Shiki has a Jamaican accent and refers to Nami as "Baby Doll."
