membership.
History
[
]
Chesskippa was one of the
pirate captains
who took in
Robin
when she was running away from the
Marines
and the
World Government
. Later, when he was targeted by the Marines for housing Robin, Chesskippa was left horribly injured and desperately attempted to hand over the girl to save his own skin. However, Robin had already fled by then, leading Chesskippa to curse her name.
