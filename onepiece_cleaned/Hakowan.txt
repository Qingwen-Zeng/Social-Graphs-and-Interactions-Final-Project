Hakowan
is
Wapol
's
pet
dog, acquired after
Wapol was permanently deposed
from
Drum Island
.
Appearance
[
]
Hakowan before Wapol altered him.
Hakowan used to be a regular dog with small beady eyes and a tongue sticking out, similar to
Chouchou
, but smaller in size and without a frown.
After Wapol altered him with his
Baku Baku no Mi
abilities, he now has a box for a head and lenses for eyes.
Personality
[
]
Hakowan is somewhat disrespectful of others, since he urinated on Wapol when he first met him and kept doing so occasionally. Despite this, he is loyal to the former king, as he stood by his side through the entire cover story and beyond.

Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah
[
]
Following his defeat by
Luffy
, Wapol was forced into complete poverty, living in an unnamed town's garbage dump. Here, he was found by a stray dog that followed—and urinated—on him everywhere he went.
Eventually, Wapol began using his
powers
to amuse himself by merging random garbage into toys. The dog became swept up among his building materials, having its head merged with a box and two binocular-like lenses.
This process apparently did no physical harm to him, and he continued to stay by Wapol's side, serving as a sort of mascot for Wapol's burgeoning toy business.
Wapol, surprisingly, kept the dog through his entire business career, long after he had (re)gained more wealth and status than even Drum's throne had offered him.
