When
Luffy
was still a kid and living in Foosha Village, he went to Gyoru and Chicken's fish shop to buy some fish. While Luffy was buying fish, Gyoru commented on how the kid was in such a good mood and then asked him if the
Red Hair Pirates
had left him behind again while they went on their journey. Gyoru then mentioned how Luffy could not swim anymore, to which Luffy responded happily that he was enjoying the other effects of the
Gomu Gomu no Mi
.
Ten years later, when Luffy had grown old enough to set sail, Gyoru laughed about how he had never expected Luffy to be serious about becoming a
pirate
. He then watched as Luffy took off on his journey.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
He is not depicted in the anime's
original adaptation of Chapter 1
, which compressed Luffy's backstory into a shorter flashback. However, he is included in several subsequent adaptations, such as
Episode 504
and the
Episode of East Blue
special.
Ironically, his first appearance in the anime was one
not
(openly) depicted in the manga: in the prelude to the
Loguetown Arc
, where he is established as the villager that
Woop Slap
rebukes for celebrating
Luffy
's first
bounty
.
