While the
Revolutionary Army
's officers were discussing their recent victory in
Centaurea
,
Dragon
walked up to Terry Gilteo who was sorting through bounty posters and taking down notes on the
Straw Hats
. When Dragon asked him who was on the bounty posters, Terry Gilteo replied that it was
Monkey D. Luffy
and explained to his leader of the pirate's actions since taking down
Crocodile
and then causing trouble at
Enies Lobby
. As he talked about their threat to the
World Government
, he was unaware of the fact that Luffy was actually Dragon's son, and so when he was about to discuss the pirate's relation to
