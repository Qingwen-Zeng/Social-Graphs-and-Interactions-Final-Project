Water 7 Arc

After the
Straw Hat Pirates
arrived at Water 7, the Franky Family mugged
Usopp
and stole
200,000,000 from him. When Usopp entered their house to take the money back, the Franky Family beat him up and threw him out.
Moments later, they fought against
Luffy
,
Zoro
,
Sanji
and
Chopper
. Tamagon and the other Franky Family members were badly beaten. After Franky abducts Usopp later that night, the Franky Family tried to lure out the Straw Hat Pirates but caught the attention of CP9.
CP9 then beat up Tamagon and the others before heading to Franky's hideout where they abducted Franky and Usopp. After CP9 left Water 7, Tamagon and the others turn to the Straw Hats for help.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Upon arriving at
Enies Lobby
, the Franky Family along with the Straw Hats and the
Galley-La
workers laid down their plan of attack. The Franky Family were supposed to move in and open the main gate. Once they reached the main gate, they were faced against the two giants who guarded it,
Oimo
and
Kashii
. Tamagon was on Zambai's team, which entered a fierce combat against the giants, and with the aid of Galley-La, they managed to bring them down, opened the gate and led the way for the incoming Straw Hat pirates. The team, riding the giant King Bulls, advanced towards the inner section of the island defeating foe after foe, until they reached the courthouse. There, they split into two groups in order to find the two separate switches that lower the bridge to the Tower of Justice. Zambai,
Paulie
and a handful of Franky Family members, including Tamagon, engaged the Three-Headed Chief Justice
Baskerville
in combat but were eventually subdued and apparently defeated.
Upon the news of the Buster Call's issue reaching them, Tamagon and his comrades are already freed by Paulie and desperately tried to make a move and escape the island. When they reached the coast, the Franky Family come across the warship led by Vice Admiral
Strawberry
, who ordered his men to attack the criminals. The group got bombed and thrown off a cliff but were all saved at the last minute by Paulie's ropes. With the Straw Hat Pirates drawing the attention of the Marines, Zambai and Paulie lead their men aboard the sea train, thus escaping the burning island.
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
During the Straw Hats party, Tamagon joined in alongside everyone else that participated in the Enies Lobby fight.
Later, after discovering that Franky became a wanted man, the Franky Family tried to convince him to join the Straw Hat Pirates. Tamagon stole Franky's swim briefs and started the chase throughout Water 7. When Franky found them, he managed to defeat them easily, including Tamagon.
