Moscato’s lifespan is stolen by Big Mom during one of her craving-induced rampages.
When his mother went on a rampage and started devouring everything in
Sweet City
in an attempt to satisfy her craving for croquembouche, Moscato attempted to calm his mother. After hearing a seemingly random voice, Big Mom struck down a flaming ball of fire in front of Moscato and questioned who was interrupting her. Seeing as how Moscato was her son, the citizens became overjoyed and were confident that he could put a stop to Big Mom's hunger pang. Moscato then promised to get her the croquembouche as soon as possible, but
Mont-d'Or
warned him that it was no use. However, Moscato refused to back down, claiming that he would not abandon the city and let it be destroyed. Big Mom then struck down yet again with a ray of thunder and Moscato questioned her if she recognized him. However, the response he received was "Life or Treat?" Moscato still tried to calm Big Mom once more, but he was soon overwhelmed by the fact that she was willing to take his own life, and so turned around and fled. He begged for mercy and promised not to get in her way anymore, but it was too late, and Big Mom ended up
stealing forty years of his life
, leaving him incapacitated and presumed to be dead by everyone that witnessed the horrific scene.
Later, after she had regained her senses, Big Mom left to speak with
Jinbe
and Moscato's unconscious body was carried away by the Chess Soldiers while Mont-d'Or ordered Big Mom's
Incarnations
to collect every last second of his stolen years.
