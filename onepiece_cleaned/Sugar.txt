For the chapter of the same name, see
Chapter 738
.
Sugar
is a special
officer
of the
Donquixote Pirates
'
Trebol
Army.
She was one of the most integral components of
Doflamingo
's plan in keeping
Dressrosa
in line, as any dissenters were turned into
toys
by her
Hobi Hobi no Mi
powers. She is also the younger sister of
Monet
.
Due to her actions and role, she is a supporting antagonist during the
Dressrosa Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Sugar appears to be a ten-year-old girl, but is actually much older, being 22.
This halt in aging is due to the effects of her
Devil Fruit
.
She has aquamarine shoulder-length hair and dark blue eyes. During the takeover of
Dressrosa
, she wore a light-colored dress and a cape with bear-like ears on the hood.
While she is in the underground world, she wears a white dress with light blue polka dots, a magenta hooded cape with bear-like ears, a monocle shaped and worn like an eyepatch on her left eye, and a small crown, as well as open-toed sandals.
Her monocle is pink with a purple lens.
Personality
[
]
She is loyal to Doflamingo and helped him take over the kingdom of
Dressrosa
. She is shown to be cruel, turning many citizens into toys and subjugating them into slavery, leaving them forgotten by anyone who knew them.
She took great pride in what she did, as she was angry when the toys returned to their original forms and intended to exact her revenge. However, she still seems to have some degree of empathy as she looked a bit saddened upon seeing the dwarves' hopelessly naïve faith in Usoland despite him having seemingly abandoned them to their fate, indicating that she felt pity for them.
She has shown signs of childish behavior, as demonstrated when she ran around the palace, looking for Doflamingo, after he had already left for
Punk Hazard
.
Sugar appears to be fairly indifferent about the events that happen around her, as she showed no reaction when
Baby 5
attacked Doflamingo. However, she happens to have a weak fortitude, as she became utterly terrified after she forced
Usopp
to eat the extra-spicy
Tatababasco
-laced grape, at which point he made a horrifying visage of pain that scared Sugar into unconsciousness.
As a result of this, she became terrified of long noses and things that looked like long noses, becoming scared when a long nosed soldier offered her some sausage.
She is also capable of expressing shock, like when Trebol smashed a ship through the tower or got creeped out at the hands that sprouted on her and held her.
She is smart and perceptive as upon seeing the Tontattas confronting her, she immediately realized that the dwarves were with someone else in the tower as they were quickly able of figuring out her lies in spite of their gullibility, and deduced that the dwarves had been up to something over the last year as they had not come to the palace during this time.
Sugar has a fondness for grapes, which are apparently her favorite food. She often eats them off her fingers. She is shown to be quite rude to Trebol, despite the latter being in charge of her protection.
She seems to be annoyed when people consider her weak due to her child-like appearance, to the point where she (literally) drops everything to show off her strength.
In spite of her appearance, Sugar is highly self-assured, confident in her abilities. She got annoyed when the dwarves charged at her because of her child-like appearance, and took it upon herself to turn most of them into toys. She even stepped in to save Doflamingo from Kyros by turning him into a toy. However, she does not seem to mind having support, as she did not mind having Trebol when facing against the remaining dwarves and Usopp. She is cunning, capable of using her childish appearance by putting up a facade of innocence to lure people in so she could turn them into toys. Sugar is capable of crying on cue and pretending to offer Luffy and Law grapes as a trap, and this would have succeeded if Usopp had not sniped a plant that traumatized her again. Sugar's confidence and pride tend to border on overconfidence and a bit of arrogance that caused the downfall of not only her but also Doflamingo. When Usopp was on the verge of unconsciousness, Sugar refused to return to the castle and fed him the Tatababasco-laced grape, which led to Usopp making a horrifying visage that scared Sugar into unconsciousness, causing not only the toys to revert back to their original forms but also revealed Doflamingo's tyranny for over 10 years.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Monet
[
]
Sugar and
Monet
are sisters whom Doflamingo saved from a terrible environment when Sugar was 9 years old and Monet was 17 years old. Sugar and Monet were never shown interacting with each other, and it's unknown if Sugar is aware of Monet's death.
Donquixote Pirates
[
]
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
As
Donquixote Doflamingo
is her captain, savior, and benefactor, Sugar and Monet are incredibly loyal to him, willing to lay down their lives for his sake.
Sugar seems to have a good relationship with Doflamingo and will follow his orders unquestioningly, keeping the toys of Dressrosa transformed.
She felt that her fainting was partially her own fault and tried to make up for it by turning all the citizens of Dressrosa into toys.
Trebol
[
]
Despite
Trebol
dutifully guarding her under the orders of Doflamingo, Sugar does not get along well with him and openly expresses her desire for him to die. In turn, Trebol often refers to her as a brat and treats her like a child.
Others
[
]
Sugar seems to be ruthless with the lower-ranking subordinates, as when one foot soldier with a long nose gave her sausages, which triggered her trauma from her battle against Usopp, she turned him into a toy.
Gladius
became annoyed when Sugar fainted a second time and caused her powers over the toy fighters to disperse once again.
Trafalgar Law
, formerly a prominent member of the crew, does not seem familiar with Sugar or her powers, as he gave no sign of acknowledgement or caution when she approached him and Luffy.
Enemies
[
]
As the central pillar to the Donquixote Pirates operations in the
underworld
, she is the most targeted and vulnerable of the crew, hence one of the Elite Officers acting as her bodyguard.
She is especially disliked by those who she turned into
toys
via her Devil Fruit power. Upon inadvertently releasing all of her victims from her powers, she swears to turn them all back into slaves for Doflamingo.
Usopp
[
]
After she wakes up from being scared unconscious, Sugar holds particular contempt and trauma for Usopp, reacting in horror whenever she sees someone with a long nose or anything that resembles such.
The Straw Hats were among the many people she swore to turn into toys, though she ultimately fell prey to Usopp's attack again.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, she had a high level of authority in the crew.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Sugar demonstrates her speed against a group of Tontattas.
Despite her child-like physique and having
Trebol
as her bodyguard, Sugar is quite formidable in terms of speed and agility, as seen when she countered a number of attacking
Tontatta
dwarves
, who can move fast enough that normal
humans
cannot see them.
However, she has a rather weak constitution, as she freaked out and lost consciousness when Usopp made a horrifying visage of pain and anguish after being force-fed the Tatababasco-laced grape.
This became her weakness, because whenever she sees anything that even remotely reminds her of Usopp's terrifying expression, she may suffer a flashback that could cause her to faint.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Hobi Hobi no Mi
Toys created by Sugar's power.
Sugar ate the Hobi Hobi no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
which allows her to transform any living creature she touches into a subservient living
toy
. When someone gets transformed into a toy, their existence is completely erased from the memory of everyone who ever knew them.
This fruit also stopped her aging process, causing her to physically remain a child.
After turning someone into a toy, she has to create a contract with them and set rules for them to follow. A toy has no choice but to obey all of the conditions that Sugar has ordered them to follow, leaving them helplessly trapped in their toy bodies. If she fails to make said contract, then the toy will keep its free will.
If Sugar is ever knocked unconscious, then all the individuals she turned into toys will revert back into their original selves. Given how many people were transformed, it could prove disastrous to her and the rest of her crew.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Sugar and her sister
Monet
used to live in a terrible environment. When Sugar was 9 years old and Monet was 17 years old,
Donquixote Doflamingo
saved them from that environment.
They decided to give up their former lives for the sake of the Donquixote Family and seem to have joined the crew sometime after
Trafalgar Law
left, as they were not seen with the family during Law's time with the crew.
Sugar ate the Hobi Hobi no Mi at age ten,
ceasing to age since then. Two years after attaining her eternal youth (eight years before the Battle of Marineford), she was seen assisting the other
Donquixote Pirates
in the invasion of the royal palace at Dressrosa.
When Doflamingo held Riku Doldo III captive at the palace, Kyros arrived to confront him. When Kyros attempted to attack Doflamingo to save Doldo from execution, Sugar transformed Kyros into a toy, making him her first known victim. Despite this, Kyros managed to escape the palace with Doldo.
Because Sugar failed to make a contract with him, Kyros retained his free will even as a toy.
After Doflamingo successfully took over Dressrosa, Sugar turned many more of the citizens into living toys. Over the years, her victims include Dressrosa's soldiers, pirates, Marines, Government officials, royalty from other countries, members of the Revolutionary Army, and even animals.
Three and a half years before the current storyline, Sugar came to Doflamingo with news that
a new
Warlord of the sea
was chosen, with the news intriguing Doflamingo.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Punk Hazard Arc
[
]
Sugar with Doflamingo.
Sugar was first seen sitting beside
Doflamingo
on one of his chairs outside the Dressrosa palace. She watched and ate grapes as
Baby 5
attempted to attack Doflamingo and Doflamingo talked to
Vergo
about the situation with
Law
.
She was later seen searching for Doflamingo. She asked
Lao G
and
Giolla
where Doflamingo had gone, who replied that he was probably in the room on the fourth floor. Sugar told him that Doflamingo was not in the room, to which Lao G sighed and replied by saying that Doflamingo had gone out by himself again.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
She was later seen watching the Den Den Mushis in the Dressrosa palace ring, after Doflamingo's false resignation from the Seven Warlords of the Sea.
Later on that day,
Baby 5
asked her where Doflamingo was, to which she responded that she did not know.
After the losers from the Corrida Colosseum tournament were imprisoned, she turned them into toys one at a time.
While
Franky
was attempting to enter the Toy House, Sugar heard the skirmish through a Den Den Mushi. Trebol assured Sugar that the Straw Hats' goal was the SMILE factory and that she could just turn them into toys if they managed to reach that far. Trebol also told her with certainty that nobody knew of her existence, though he was wrong about that. Sugar remained calm, apparently unaware that she was the target of
Usopp
,
Robin
, Kyros, and an army of
dwarves
.
When
Cavendish
was brought to the executive tower, Sugar transformed him into a toy and put him under the control of the Donquixote Family. Meanwhile, Usopp and the dwarves stood outside her room as
Leo
discussed poisoning Sugar with
Tatababasco
disguised as a grape, which would knock her out.
Sugar transforms several dwarves into toys.
Robin, disguised as one of Doflamingo's subordinates, entered the room and lured Trebol out of the tower. Once Trebol left, a group of dwarves charged in and rushed at Sugar. The attack failed when Sugar transformed some of the dwarves into her toy servants and ordered them to kill all the intruders in the tower. While her toys battled the rest of the dwarves, she picked up a Den Den Mushi and warned Trebol of the trap.
She was taken by surprise when a ship thrown by Trebol crashed into the tower.
Robin used her Devil Fruit powers in an attempt to knock out Sugar with the spice the dwarves were going to use. Sugar escaped her clutches by touching one of her arms, transforming Robin into a toy. With Trebol beside her and all the dwarves incapacitated, Sugar picked up the false grape and took a look at it.
Sugar freaks out upon witnessing Usopp's visage.
After Usopp was beaten badly from his fight with Trebol, Sugar forced the fake grape into his mouth. After a moment, Usopp started screaming in pain and made a tortured expression so startling that it caused her to echo his horrific scream, pass out, and foam at the mouth.
With Sugar's loss of consciousness, her powers were broken, and every living thing she had turned into a toy over the past ten years turned back to its original form, simultaneously restoring all the lost memories associated with them. This resulted in a mass panic throughout the kingdom, as families reunited, pirates and wild beasts raged, and the Donquixote Family's control of Dressrosa crumbled.
She was later seen, still unconscious, at the royal palace, which had been relocated to the top of the Flower Hill by
Pica
.
Some time after that, she was revived thanks to the powers of Princess
Mansherry
's
Devil Fruit ability
.
After re-awakening, she developed a fear of long noses and things that look like long noses. She created an army of giant nutcrackers, each consisting of eight humans, to defend the palace. She also swore to turn the people of Dressrosa into toys again and get revenge on Usopp.
Sugar freaks out again thanks to Usopp's technique.
She headed to the Castle Garden to meet
Luffy
and
Law
after being informed of their presence by her subordinates. She prepared to exact revenge by touching them and erasing their entire existence. Just as she got close to the two, Usopp locked on to Sugar from the old King's Plateau, launching a "Long Range Bagworm" after awakening his
Observation Haki
. The bagworm contained a recreation of Usopp's Tatababasco face made by
Kanjuro
, which flew by Sugar at close range and high speed. This attack caused Sugar to relive her earlier trauma and lose consciousness once again, saving both Luffy and Law from her powers.
She was subsequently brought to the timeout room alongside the defeated
Lao G
,
Machvise
,
Dellinger
and
Gladius
. Giolla intended to use Mansherry's healing powers to revive them. However, Leo and Kabu thwarted Giolla's plans, defeated her, and rescued Mansherry.
After Doflamingo's defeat, Sugar and her fellow officers were arrested by the Marines.
