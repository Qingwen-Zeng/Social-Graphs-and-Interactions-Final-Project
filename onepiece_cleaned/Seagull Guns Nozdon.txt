History
[
]
Nozdon was first seen on the
Oro Jackson
prior to the battle with
Shiki
at
Edd War
. He was later seen entering the fight.
Around 26 years ago, the
Roger Pirates
were causing a ruckus on an island. After defeating a group of
Marines
, they learned that the
Whitebeard Pirates
docked on the other side of the island.
The Roger Pirates then clashed with the Whitebeard Pirates for three days and three nights before the skirmish ultimately became a gift exchange. The Roger Pirates were later joined by
Oden
and his family as well as
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
. At some point, the Roger Pirates visited
Skypiea
.
After leaving Skypiea, the crew's voyage took them to
Water 7
,
Tequila Wolf
,
Sabaody Archipelago
, and
Fish-Man Island
. Sometime later, they left
Toki
,
Momonosuke
,
Hiyori
, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi at
Wano Country
. Sometime after the visit to
Zou
, the Roger Pirates finally reached
Laugh Tale
. When the crew discovered
Joy Boy
's treasure, they responded with a burst of laughter.
Nozdon was seen partying with the Roger Pirates one year before the start of the Great Age of Pirates.
Sometime after
Roger
became
Pirate King
, Roger decided to disband the crew. Roger was the first to leave and the crew tearfully parted ways with him. They later returned Oden to Wano Country and they bid farewell to him as well.
His whereabouts after his captain disbanded the crew are unknown.
