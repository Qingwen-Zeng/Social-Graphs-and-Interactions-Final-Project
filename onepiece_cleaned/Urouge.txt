Urouge
,
nicknamed the
Mad Monk
, is a
pirate
hailing from a
sky island
and
high priest
of the
Fallen Monk Pirates
.
He is one of twelve pirates referred to as the "
Worst Generation
",
and prior to the two-year timeskip had a bounty of
108,000,000.
Appearance
[
]
Urouge is abundant in both height and width. His face somewhat resembles a smiling totem mask as he is nearly always seen grinning, even when he is unhappy; the only moments he is not seen smiling was when he was approaching
Raijin Island
, when he was confounded by the island spewing lightning nonstop, and again when he gives final benedictions to
Kaidou
's jumping off a sky island. Apart from his smile, he also has what appears to be a stitched-up scar vertically descending over, and falling short just above his left eye. On his chin he has a prominent, jet-black, and scruffy beard that extends upwards to the sides of his jaw and then converges with his equally-dark side-burns. He seems to sport the short and clean-cut sort of hairstyle generally sported by monks. He also has black tattoos going down his shoulders that somewhat resemble fire.
He dresses in similar robes to
Divine Soldiers
underneath the khaki robes he wears (which is also worn by the rest of his crew), which includes the white full-bodied garment with severed sleeves, that exposes tattoos patterned like flames on both biceps. He wears a pair of gold earrings, black gloves and a rather large red bead necklace. He also has a pair of large wings growing out from the middle of his back.
In
SBS Volume 64
, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Urouge is shown with the hairstyle and wings of the
Skypieans
', but as an adult, his wings are more like the
Birka
natives.

Personality
[
]
Urouge's most prominent personality trait is that he is almost always smiling. Even when defeated or when believing himself to be near death, he will still have a smile on his face, such as when he was heavily wounded by a
Pacifista
. The only times he has not been seen smiling are when his crew approached
Raijin Island
and when he prayed for
Kaidou
.
From what has been shown of Urouge so far he can be considered a brave man, as he was not afraid of fighting people with higher bounties than him, such as
Killer
. However, it is possible that he did not know his bounty
or
he knew that Killer had a high bounty because he notoriously attacks civilians. In spite of this though, he quit the battle when
X Drake
jumped in to halt the fight. Despite being brave he is not blind to danger either, for when he faced a Pacifista (who he believed was the real
Kuma
) and
Kizaru
at the same time, he wondered if that was his end. However, even when facing death, he could still laugh at what he believed was a joke, made by
Basil Hawkins
, about his fate.
Urouge seems to be respectful toward people's plights, as he did not stop Kaidou when the
Emperor
attempted to commit suicide and instead prayed.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of the Worst Generation, Urouge is a powerful pirate, having managed to traverse and survive the dangers of the Grand Line and earn a bounty of
108,000,000 by the time he and his crew reached the
Sabaody Archipelago
.
After the timeskip, Urouge was strong enough to defeat
Charlotte Snack
, one of Big Mom's Four Sweet Commanders and one of the strongest members of the Emperor's crew with a bounty of
600,000,000, although he was later defeated by
Charlotte Cracker
, another Sweet Commander in the
Big Mom Pirates
(although he was possibly exhausted from his first fight with Snack).
However despite his defeat, Urouge managed to survive and retreat.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Befitting his physique, Urouge has enormous strength, able to wield a large and heavy pillar as a makeshift mace, despite his size, he is deceptively fast with extremely sharp reflexes, able to keep up with
Killer
's tremendous agility and also hold his own against his fellow Supernova who has a significantly higher bounty in a fight before having their fight interrupted by
X Drake
.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Urouge increasing his muscle mass.
Urouge ate a currently unnamed
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to convert damage inflicted onto him into physical strength, which results in expanding muscles and enlarged body size.
Using this ability, he was able to exceed a
Pacifista
's body size
and actually damage it with his punches, although he was still vulnerable to its lasers and a kick from Admiral Kizaru.
Attacks
[

Inga Zarashi
(
因果晒し
,
Inga Zarashi
?
, literally meaning "Karma Exposure")
: After transforming to his gigantic, muscular size, Urouge punches his target multiple times with immense force. This was first seen used against a Pacifista.
This is called
Karmic Punishment

Karma Exposure
in the
Funimation
subs.
Weapons

Urouge's choice of weapon appears to be a large piece of a pillar with a hexagonal base which he uses as a makeshift mace to pummel opponents. When not in use, it is mostly seen being carried on his shoulder.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Born in an unidentified sky island, Urouge somehow became a pirate and started the
Fallen Monk Pirates
, but they eventually ended up in the
Blue Sea
, how this happened and why is currently unknown. Urouge would later come to become a pirate known for his great strength and his crew traveled through the Blue Seas, where their captain made himself a reputation. He then traveled to the
Grand Line
and became an infamous enough pirate to earn a high bounty of
108,000,000 before reaching the
Sabaody Archipelago
.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
On
Sabaody Archipelago
, Urouge had a brief brawl with
Killer
of the
Kid Pirates
. Both were stopped by the former-marine-turned-pirate
X Drake
before either could do further damage.
Urouge was later told by
his crew
that a
World Noble
was coming their way. Though he referred to the nobles as "nasty little things," he consented along with the other pirates and civilians to lower themselves to their knees to avoid any trouble. He respected
Roronoa Zoro
for standing up and almost trying to kill one of them, while he himself preferred to "sit it off". He also pondered the strength of the
Straw Hat Pirates
' Captain, to have such an incredible person as Zoro with such a high bounty serve under him.
When reading of
Portgas D. Ace
's planned execution, Urouge did not lose his eternal smile but seemed disturbed.
When the news of
Monkey D. Luffy
attacking a World Noble spread, he called the Straw Hats "troublesome" but seemed impressed by their actions.

Urouge tried to sneak off to avoid confronting
Admiral
Kizaru
but was attacked by a
Pacifista
. His strength seemed to prove no match for the cyborg and was thrown into the fight between Kizaru and
Basil Hawkins
. Upon noticing the Admiral, Urouge began to panic but Hawkins assured him that death was not in Urouge's future. Drake then rushed in to help him, knocking the Pacifista back with a strong kick. Using his devil fruit abilities, Urouge's muscle mass expanded, growing large enough to match the Pacifista in height and muscle mass.
Urouge began to fight back. With his new strength, he was able to land powerful blows to the Pacifista and cause enough damage to hold it off. However, just as he began to gain the upper hand, it shot a laser beam through his shoulder.
Urouge is defeated by Kizaru.
With him down, the Pacifista turned its attention towards Drake. As Urouge rose to get his second wind, Kizaru reminded him of his presence, and proceeded to attack him from behind, kicking him at the
speed of light
through three buildings.
Urouge was knocked out cold from this attack, severely wounded and bloodied.
He was able to escape from the Admiral due to the Straw Hats distracting Kizaru.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Urouge watched Ace's execution televised at Sabaody Archipelago, meaning that he managed to escape capture by the Marines.
Post-War Arc

to
Raijin Island
that was spewing lightning, with no way to have a ship docking there. On a small boat,
Kasa
approached the
Hanjomaru
and offered the pirates some umbrellas.
During the Timeskip
[
]
Sometime during the two-year timeskip, Urouge and his crew wandered into
Big Mom
's
territory
. Even though Urouge defeated one of the former
Four Sweet Commanders
named
Charlotte Snack
, he was later sought after by
Charlotte Cracker
while Big Mom called a storm in a fit of rage. Urouge was swiftly defeated by Cracker and forced to flee like the other members of the
Worst Generation
.

After Luffy and
Law
's alliance defeated

, Urouge and his crew were still recovering from their injuries and travelled to the the ruined sky island,
Ballon Terminal
, in order to avoid others.
However, his crew discovered that
Emperor
Kaidou
was also on the island and about to jump to his death. Urouge questioned Kaidou's motives for suicide but chose not to interfere due to Kaidou's seriousness. Urouge instead began to pray as the Emperor jumped.

The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
One Piece: Stampede
[
]
Urouge and his crew attended the
Pirates Festival
on
Delta Island
. He participated in the main event, the Treasure Race, safely sailing up the
Knock Up Stream
and landing on the central Treasure Island, where all the pirates raced for
Gol D. Roger
's treasure, all the while battling other Worst Generation members. When
Buggy
ended up exposing himself after snatching the treasure, Urouge and his crew chased after the Warlord. However, the Treasure Race was cut short, when someone threw a galleon at the island, destroying it, and sending everything plummeting back to the surface. When Urouge realized that the one who did this was
Douglas Bullet
, he was quite surprised. In the end, he gave into Bullet's taunting, and together with the other Worst Generation members (except for Zoro and Law) attacked the Demon Heir. At first the Worst Generation pirates managed to deal a few good blows on the veteran, but when the opponent revealed his
Gasha Gasha no Mi
powers, the battle quickly ended in their defeat.
Later, after Bullet was defeated, his crew along with the other Worst Generation pirates and several other crews attempted to breakthrough the
Marines
encirclement surrounding the island. They were able to successfully escape thanks to
Sabo
and
Ann
's illusion of Ace creating a blazing barrier to protect them.
