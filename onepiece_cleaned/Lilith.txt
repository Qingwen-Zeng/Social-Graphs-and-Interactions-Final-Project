Appearance
[
]
Lilith has the appearance of a young woman with wild ginger hair and purple eyes, with her hair covering her right eye. She wears a pink full-body jumpsuit that bears her designation of Punk-02 on the left breast; she also wears a purple hooded jacket with sleeves that are baggy around the forearm area, purple DOM shoes, black gloves, and a red aviator helmet.
Like the other satellites, she wears an earpiece and antenna on her left ear which enables communication with Vegapunk's other manifestations.
Personality
[
]
Being designated the "evil" satellite of Vegapunk, Lilith is the manifestation of Vegapunk's ruthless and malevolent traits, thus coming off as a very deceptive and untrustworthy individual. She utilizes her technology and weaponry to steal from voyagers, chiefly pirates, who trespass on Egghead, justifying this to Shaka as necessary for the sake of keeping Vegapunk's research operational.
She also thought nothing of handing the
Straw Hat Pirates
to
CP0
, being fully aware that
Rob Lucci
was an
assassin
.
Her "evil" nature made the original Vegapunk suspect her of betraying them until her name was cleared.
Lilith's impulsive attitude.
Lilith possesses a rash attitude and often acts impulsively, annoyed and derisively. For this reason, she is one of the most outgoingly combative and daring of the satellites, being eager to confront any perceived enemies directly and violently, although she has moments of clarity and will pull back in situations she cannot win.
Lilith also hates being ordered around, especially by Shaka, her "good" counterpart whose exemplary behavior tends to constantly get under her skin.
Despite being "evil", Lilith actually has a compassionate side. She cares about her fellow satellites, as she wanted to fight CP0 to avenge Atlas. She also was deeply worried when Edison almost got killed by S-Shark's laser and relieved when Sanji saved him in time. She mourned the deaths of Stella and her fellow satellites, although she quickly got over it after crying for a bit knowing that all the other satellites can still be “alive”.
She uses the
first-person pronoun
washi
(
わし
?
)
, which is an old-fashioned term usually associated with men in period fiction, such as samurai. She also uses stereotypical old fashioned speech patterns such as the copula
ja
(
じゃ
?
)
.

Satellites
[
]
While Vegapunk's satellites all refer to themselves as Vegapunk, they each exemplify only one portion of Vegapunk's personality, and all have their own wills and desires and are therefore effectively six unique people. While this normally isn't an issue as Vegapunk is supposed to synchronize his brain with all of his satellites via
Punk Records
,
York
decided to betray Vegapunk and her fellow satellites in an effort to become a
World Noble
. Once her treachery was revealed, she was effectively treated as an enemy by Vegapunk and the other satellites. After escaping Egghead, Lilith revealed her fellow Satellite are technically alive.
Shaka
[
]
She and Shaka have a rivalry toward each other due to being the "Evil" and "Good" Vegapunk respectively. However, Lilith cared for Shaka, mourning his "death" due to York's betrayal.
Edison
[
]
Lilith cares for Edison, as seen when she mourned for his "death" after York's betrayal even though he was merely injured.
Pythagoras
[
]
Lilith cared for Pythagoras, mourning his "death" due to York's betrayal.
York
[
]
Once York's betrayal was revealed, Lilith became furious at her, referring to her as a traitor.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Initially, Lilith didn't care about the infamous pirate crew and only 'saved' them from drowning so she can plunder them. While she agrees to bring them to Egghead under Shaka's instructions and was happy to explain the technologic of the island, she remained hostile to them. But once she learned the World Government had come to assassinate her and the other Vegapunks, she accepted them as allies. She became more friendly with them and work alongside to against the
Seraphim
, and later
Jaygarcia Saturn
. Despite being the only Vegapunk they manage to save (Shaka, Pythagoras and Stella getting killed, Edison and Atlas sacrificing themselves to ensure their escape, and York betraying them), Lilith didn't blame them and told them they didn't fail because they saved her.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being one of six manifestations of the genius scientist Vegapunk, Lilith has contributed to his numerous technological advances and breakthroughs. Despite the technology and weaponry at her disposal, Lilith was cautioned by Shaka that she was not equipped to take on
Roronoa Zoro
and
Nico Robin
, two members of an
Emperor's
crew with bounties around
1 billion, in combat.
Engineering Expertise
[
]
Lilith has made heavy use of mechas and cybernetically enhanced animals to aid her in combat. She pilots a giant mecha called the
Vegaforce-01
, which is extremely large to the point of being able to carry the
Thousand Sunny
in its hands. The Vega Force is able to move underwater and unleash explosions when it punches. Additionally, Lilith has power over
Sea Beasts
that she has turned into
cyborgs
. These Sea Beasts are equipped with numerous weapons, with an example being the
Mecha-Shark
having a torpedo launcher in its mouth. This army of cyborg creatures allows Lilith to easily surround and overwhelm ships sailing the sea, enabling her to loot them. However, she has had issues with achieving programming to completely override the organic urges of the creatures, which limits her ability to have them do exactly what she wants; Shaka himself would also note that any equipment, weaponry and modified Sea Beasts at Lilith's disposal would be useless against a swordsman of Zoro's caliber.
Weapons
[
]
Lilith's Bubble Gun.
Lilith wields a large futuristic-looking
gun
,
called a
Bubble Gun
(
バブルガン
,
Baburugan
?
)
because it shoots bubbles that are capable of deflecting any attacks.
These bubbles, called
Bubble Balls
(
バブルボール
,
Baburubōru
?
)
,
are made of a special material containing sea energy, meaning they also serve as a weakness for
Devil Fruit
users.

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
When the
Straw Hat Pirates
drew near to
Egghead
on the
Thousand Sunny
, the
Mecha-Shark
went to attack them. With the shark's primal urges overriding its programming and threatening to completely annihilate the crew's possessions, Lilith went underwater in the
Vegaforce-01
and took it down before lifting the Sunny back above water. Lilith then exited the Vega Force and introduced herself as Dr. Vegapunk, to general confusion.
Lilith informed the pirates that she did not rescue them, but rather spared them from the Mecha-Shark so she could rob them of their valuables. She summoned her army of weaponized
Sea Beasts
to surround the Straw Hats, ordering them to surrender to her their valued possessions at once, but then received a call from fellow satellite
Shaka
who informed her she had blundered in her antagonism of the pirates, pointing out that they were poised to target and overwhelm her if they retaliate much to Lilith's dismay, embarrassed that she overlooked something that could have easily led to her downfall.
Roronoa Zoro
told Lilith to play nice, and Shaka told his counterpart to bring the pirates to him as he has interest with the Straw Hats.
Though not very pleased about this slipped opportunity, Lilith complied with Shaka's request and used Vegaforce-01 to transport the Sunny towards Egghead into the upper part of the island, the research laboratory.
She then led the Straw Hats, minus
Brook
and Zoro, into the lab while explaining its technological specialties. She did this, however, purposefully as she made contact with
Edison
and she, alongside Edison and
Pythagoras
, unleashed the
Seraphim
S-Shark
onto the Straw Hats to test its fight capabilities and qualities. However, their test run was soon ended by Shaka, displeasing especially Lilith who was furious at his second interference in her meddlings.
When Pythagoras informed Shaka that a
World Government
ship with
CP0
onboard was arriving at Egghead, Lilith suggested handing the pirates over to
Rob Lucci
.
However, when Lucci suspiciously pointed out several World Government ships went missing lately, Lilith annoyingly and impulsively told the group to dock at Egghead and see for themselves, ignoring Pythagoras who was against her impulsiveness.
When both the CP0-squad and the Seraphim effectively landed on Egghead, Lilith was excited at the prospect of fighting them, wanting to avenge
Atlas
who got damaged previously by Lucci. She then mentioned taking everyone to the port with Vegaforce-01 after Vegapunk's secret ally confirmed their support,
and when both CP0 and the Seraphim landed on the Labophase, Lilith made her way out alongside Edison to issue a personal command to stop the Seraphim from attacking the Labophase,
later being able to successfully make her way outside, but is then targeted by
S-Hawk
before she can issue a command. However, the attack is blocked by Zoro, and everybody is saved by Edison who commands the Seraphim to stop.
Lilith and Usopp are turned to stone by S-Snake.
Lilith would later meet up with everybody inside the Laboratory when the main Vegapunk body, Stella, went missing. She would pair up with
Usopp
,
Franky
and
York
, searching inside Tower C. Inside the tower, the group would end up finding Pythagoras' body without his head, having been separated by a previous explosion. Lilith grew impatient with Pythagoras when he freaked out about who attacked him before she turned to York who was turned into stone by
S-Snake
. Lilith tried to stop her, however, she had to jump off the bridge alongside Pythagoras, Franky and Usopp when they were shot by S-Snake. She then brushed off Franky's suggestion to directly fight the Seraphim after effortlessly trying to contact Shaka, stating they could not beat S-Snake.
Lilith later pulled out her bubble gun, revealing a significant weakness the Seraphim have which her bubble gum could exploit: Sea energy.
However, her bubbles barely missed S-Snake who seducingly tricked Franky into releasing a bubble he held onto her from her and then used her
Devil Fruit powers
to petrify both Lilith and Usopp,
The petrification was later lifted as Lilith was seen having joined the other surviving satellites, Vegapunk and the Straw Hats after they had restrained the traitor York. In order to help their escape from the Marines that had surrounded Egghead, Lilith came along with Luffy, Franky and
Jewelry Bonney
to both the Thousand Sunny and Vegaforce-01, with Vegapunk having ordered Lilith specifically to pilot Vegaforce-01.
When the Vegaforce-01 was destroyed,
Franky had Lilith pilot his
General Franky
instead.
Back on the Thousand Sunny, Brook devised a plan to use his
Devil fruit ability
to freeze the Island Clouds and glide across back to the rear entrance. While Lilith was initially pleased with and praised the plan, she questioned how he would stop the ship at the end, to which Brook had no answer, and she slapped and worried they would slide off the island.
When Brook was called by Nami again, and stated how the ship was still sliding through the rear entrance, Lilith slapped him again stating they would hit the barrier if the ship did not stop, she then got in touch with Nami to tell her something.
The Thousand Sunny was then caught before it slid off the island due to Usopp's
Midori Boshi: Take Jave Rin
, saving Lilith and Brook. While saved and regrouped with Usopp, Lilith was still annoyed at Brook and kicked him.
When
Jaygarcia Saturn
reached the group's location and attacked Robin, Lilith joined the Straw Hats to fight him off, shooting the elder to no avail. After he brushed them aside, Lilith and the others noticed the clouds extending outward.
Atlas attacks Lilith, disconnecting her from Punk Records.
Lilith noted that while they may be able to land into the sea, they would still be surrounded by the enemy ships stationed.
Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro
then caught up to the ship's location to Lilith's and the others horror but was countered from attacking due to Zoro and
Jinbe
.
Eventually, Zoro abandoned the fight with Nusjuro and made his way back onto the ship, although Nusjuro remained in the way of escape. Lilith denied all requests to leave at that moment, citing the fact that any interference by Nusjuro would ruin their trajectory and likely make them fall to their deaths. Before she could continue, Atlas suddenly punched her into the ground, and then snapped a switch behind her head. This resulted in Lilith being forcefully disconnected from Punk Records, leading York to believe she was deceased. Atlas then used the moment to sacrifice herself so that the crew could escape, taking the unconscious Lilith with them.
Lilith celebrates with her new friends.
Sometime later, Lilith would be transported to the
Giants' ship
, where she would eventually regain consciousness. She didn't take long to recognize the environment and was met with apologies from the various Straw Hats who were watching over her about their apparent failure to save the other Vegapunks, although she responded by stating she had already known about the circumstances, to their confusion. Lilith promptly burst into tears from the news but dried them just as quickly as she realized she now felt hunger, a new feeling associated with her being disconnected from York. Lilith was led to meet with Luffy, who was under the impression that he had failed the Stella and was eating massive amounts of food while crying. Lilith was annoyed by this, but relented and moved to explain that Luffy had in fact not failed at all. She explained that the other Vegapunks were only "dead", at least physically, and that they were still technically alive, to everyone's shock. The news was taken well by Luffy, who promptly perked back up and met with his Giant friends, who restarted the earlier party they had to cancel. Lilith joined in on the party with her new friends, celebrating their success.
