Appearance
[
]

After the timeskip, her pigtails are shown to be longer with her missing tooth restored. During "
"Gang" Bege's Oh My Family
", she is wearing a hairdressing gown, and her hair is loose and shorter.
She also bears a striking resemblance to her older twin sister,
Charlotte Chiffon
.
In her younger years, Lola was fatter than she is currently, was not missing a tooth, and had her hair styled into a bob. She wore an orange bow in her hair and a peach colored dress with puffy sleeves.
Personality
[
]
Lola is a woman trying to find love though she rejected a proposal from Loki. She fled from an arranged marriage with him in order to find her own true love. As of the
Thriller Bark Arc
, she has proposed 4452 times, but she has been turned down each time. Prior to meeting the Straw Hats, she had proposed 4443 times. Upon seeing
Luffy
, she makes it 4444 times. She then later proposed to
Sanji
,
Chopper
,
Usopp
,
Zoro
(twice),
Franky
(twice), and
Brook
.
Luckily, she takes rejection well and is not distraught by it.
She is also rather honorable. This is seen when she refused to abandon the Straw Hats, her crew's shining star of hope, even when she was being vaporized by the rising sun. Lola also initially said that she would never dream of taking treasure from her saviors until Nami revealed her friendship with the former's shadow zombie.
According to Chiffon, Lola has a happy-go-lucky personality, making her very optimistic and naive due to her carefree nature, as she believed that despite
her mother
's immense ruthlessness, Big Mom would still care for her. This led her to give a piece of Linlin's
Vivre Card
to Nami, under the belief that her mother would help the Straw Hats for her sake, not knowing that Big Mom holds a grudge on her for ruining a possible alliance with the
giants
.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Lola showed good skills as a captain by keeping
her crew
away from the sunlight when light was hitting
Thriller Bark
. Since her pirate crew has suffered much in the last 3 years together, they are very close with each other.
Family
[
]
Pound
[
]
Lola and Chiffon hug their father after 26 long years.
Pound is Lola's father. Even though Lola ran away from the
Charlotte Family
, he still considers her very dear to him.
However, because Linlin cast Pound away after her birth, Lola never got the chance to meet her father.
After Pound escaped from Whole Cake Island, he finally gets to meet her the first time since her birth. Lola was quite shocked when Pound said that he is her father.
However, Lola and Chiffon did not believe his claims and left him behind. Despite this rejection, Pound remained steadfast to reunite with them. His stubborn ways were enough to prove to Lola and Chiffon that he was their father and they happily embraced him.
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Lola's mother is one of the Four Emperors,
Charlotte Linlin
, also known as "Big Mom". When Lola ran away from Totto Land to escape a political marriage with Prince Loki of Elbaph, Lola was certain that her mother, despite her ruthless reputation, would not punish her because they were family. When she gave the Straw Hats her mother's vivre card, Lola showed concern and fondness for her mother and assured the Straw Hats that she would help them if they ran into trouble.
Contrary to what Lola believed, Linlin lost all affection for her estranged daughter for running away from the arranged marriage with Loki, which ruined Linlin's chance to make peace with the giants and gain the means to become Pirate King. Linlin labelled Lola as a criminal of Totto Land and would have her executed if she returns. When Nami spoke of her friendship with Lola to Big Mom, Linlin expressed utter hatred for her daughter and stated that she would never forgive her, even preparing to send an assassin to kill Lola once finding out of her whereabouts. Big Mom was furious to hear that Lola even still considered her family, saying that Lola truly did not understand how her mother feels. In fact, Big Mom's hatred for Lola is so immense that she would go into a berserker like rage just from seeing Lola's image in her identical twin sister
Chiffon
whenever she sees her, and brutally abused Chiffon to vent her anger towards Lola.
Charlotte Chiffon
[
]
Lola is Chiffon's only full-blooded sister, and one of the few people that Chiffon considers to be true family. One of the reasons that Chiffon is participating in the plot against Big Mom is because she knows Lola is in danger from their mother. She is also aware of Lola's personality and correctly guessed that her twin sister is completely ignorant of their mother's murderous rage towards her. Despite being mistreated due to Lola's actions, Chiffon never blamed her sister for it, instead expressed happiness that Lola was doing fine.
After escaping from Big Mom, the first thing Chiffon wanted to do was reunite with her sister. Once they were reunited at Dressrosa, they were tearfully overjoyed.
Charlotte Pudding
[
]
Pudding
talked admirably about how Lola left the family to find her own groom, and wished to be able to follow this path.
When Lola left, the two seemed to part amiably.
Pudding does think highly of Lola as she refused to take her place as Minister of Chocolate, believing that Lola was fit for the role.
Other Siblings
[
]
The extent of Lola's relationship with her siblings is unknown, but the ones who were listening to Big Mom's conversation with Luffy and Nami did not express any concern when Big Mom revealed her hatred for Lola.
Charlotte Opera
was even prepared to torture Nami for Lola's location, knowing what Big Mom planned to do after acquiring that information.
Gotti
[
]
During the period where Chiffon had disappeared in Dressrosa, Gotti was on the search to find her and bring her back. Seeing a woman whom he thought was Chiffon being captured by the Marines, Gotti quickly grabbed her and took her away to safety. Gotti was shocked, however, when the woman kissed him in thanks. This was not his captain's wife but the woman they were looking for in the first place: Lola. After Lola and Chiffon happily reunited, Lola approached Gotti and once again proposed marriage to him. Before he could answer they were attacked by the Marines and had to make a hasty retreat. He then watched as she and Chiffon were tearfully reunited with their father Pound. By then Gotti had become smitten with Lola and, unlike the previous thousands of times she had proposed to other men, he accepted her proposal. Lola was finally married to Gotti, as the Fire Tank Pirates and the Rolling Pirates celebrated happily.

is on good terms with Lola, who assisted him in his fight against
Gecko Moria
by empowering him with shadows. Lola, along with every one of her comrades and allies, refused to hand over Luffy to
Bartholomew Kuma
when he offered to spare everyone else in exchange.
When Big Mom expressed her hatred for Lola, Luffy defended the latter by saying that Lola made her own decision and that it was Big Mom's own fault for not becoming Pirate King.
Nami
[
]
Lola formed a sisterly bond with
Nami
during the events of the
Thriller Bark Arc
, mostly because of Nami's interaction with
her zombie
. Through her zombie's actions, the two are very close and when they finally met up, Nami instantly recognized Lola. Lola likewise, acknowledged that there was something about Nami she recognized, but could not explain why that was. Lola also called Nami "Namizo" upon her exit from Thriller Bark, despite the fact that Nami had told her zombie, not her, this fake name. The two have since become good friends with one another, with Nami even sharing her treasure with her in appreciation for her help. Nami later became horrified for Lola's life when Big Mom reveals her intent to kill her. When Opera demanded Lola's location from Nami, she refused to reveal it even when he was going to torture her.

Abilities and Powers

Thriller Bark Saga
[
]
Thriller Bark Arc
[
]
After three years of waiting in eternal darkness, the prayers of Lola and the other victims were finally answered when
Luffy
and
his crew
came to Thriller Bark. After Luffy accepted the request of the chairman of the victim's association,
Spoil
, to get back their shadows, Lola and the other victims were given hope as Luffy and his crew wrecked havoc across Thriller Bark and purified several zombies.
Lola and the Risky Brothers are shocked with the result of their plan.
While all this was going on, the Thriller Bark Victim's Association had been collecting purified shadows. After several events, Luffy was misled into the forest by Moria. Lola's crew members, the
Risky Brothers
, luckily found Luffy and lead him to Lola. Meeting Luffy, Lola tried to ask for his hand in marriage but was unfortunately rejected again for 4444th time. Putting aside her marriage plans, Lola, as well as the other victims, thanked Luffy for all that he and his crew had done so far on the island as nothing like it had ever happened before in the past. They then, however, told Luffy that things were not over and had just gotten worse as Moria was now aiding his Special Ranked Zombie,
Oars
, in his fight against the rest of the Straw Hats. For this, Lola and the other victims decided to give Luffy some help in order to defeat Moria. Lola then demonstrated and explained how Moria's powers could be used against him by inserting the shadow of a sword-proficient Marine into Luffy. Lola and the other victims then give Luffy all of the shadows they had captured.
Surprised by the result of their action of implanting one hundred shadows into Luffy, Lola and the other victims wished Luffy luck in giving Moria a "real nightmare".
With Luffy battling Oars and Moria, Lola and the majority of the Thriller Bark Victim's Association decided to help
Brook
and the Straw Hats who were knocked out by Oars and Moria. With
Nami
and
Usopp
who had then joined them, Lola and the other victims witnessed Luffy pummel Oars and Moria with Gomu Gomu no Storm.
Overjoyed by this, they decided to come to the aid of the wiped out Luffy. Lola and the other victims' joy however was short lived as Oars decided to rise back up again. Fortunately however, the Straw Hats and Brook were able to muster up their strength and finally defeat Oars by shattering his spine with their combined teamwork.
With Oars completely unable to move any further, Lola then threatened Moria to give back all of their shadows or else he would be further pummeled by Luffy and company. Moria however was not intimidated and decided to absorb all of his zombies' shadows into himself, including Lola's own shadow.
With these, Lola and the rest witness Moria transform into a gigantic lizard-like form with immense power. As the other victims saw this monstrosity and realized that there was no more time before morning finally dawned on Thriller Bark, they decided to hide in whatever shade was left. Lola however decided to not seek shelter with the rest of them. Seeing the Straw Hats face off against Moria despite the odds, she decided to stay there and watch them or else she would feel ashamed for dragging them into her and the other victims' problem. With some last words to her crew telling them that she will watch in their place, and some sunlight burning across her face, Lola stayed where she was to witness the battle.
Lola calls for her shadow.
Despite the pleas of the other victims and her crew, Lola stood firm as she watched Luffy battle against the monstrosity that was now Moria. She stated to them that whether she disintegrates or not, she will not return to hiding in the shade. As Luffy delivered some powerful blows onto Moria and made him spew out some Shadows, Lola called out to her shadow to come back to her. Luffy also followed Lola's example and called out to his shadow as he delivered one last attack onto Moria. With one last powerful attack from Luffy, Moria spewed out all the shadows he had stolen including Lola's. Just as dawn finally arrived and sunlight engulfed all of Thriller Bark, Lola's and everybody's shadows fortunately returned back to them just in time.
With her and the rest of the Thriller Bark Victim's Association's shadows returned to normal, Lola, along with
Spoil
and the rest of the association, thanked the Straw Hats. In thanks, Lola offered herself to be the bride of any of the male Straw Hats. She was fortunately and expectedly turned down. Despite Moria being defeated, Lola and everybody's celebrations were cut short. She and everybody else noticed the
Warlord of the Sea
,
Bartholomew Kuma
, standing nearby and receiving orders to eradicate everybody on Thriller Bark. Lola had heard of Kuma's past reputation and strength, and thus tried to tell everyone to stay back. Her efforts were in vain and some of the association's members were defeated by Kuma's
Devil Fruit
powers.
Despite the foe before them, Lola and the rest of the Thriller Bark Victim's Association decided to fight against Kuma for their freedom. Zoro however told them to stay back and started fighting against Kuma. As Lola and the rest of the association witnessed Kuma fight with the Straw Hats with more of his powers, they were given an offer by the Warlord. He offered that if they and the rest of the Straw Hats surrendered Luffy to him and the World Government, he would allow all of them to live. Lola and everybody else however did not agree to this offer and responded to Kuma with a loud simultaneous no. In response, Kuma let lose a massive pressurized air attack on all of Thriller Bark.
Kuma's attack devastated the entire island and left almost everyone knocked out by the blast. After some moments of unconsciousness, Lola and those knocked out recovered from the attack. Seeing that Kuma wasn't around, Lola and most of the others figured that Kuma must have mistakenly thought that they were all killed in the blast and left.
After one day of recuperating from all of the excitement, Lola went to the Thousand Sunny to see how her saviors were doing. There she saw that their ship was loaded up with food and treasure. As she was talking with them, she slightly recognized
Nami
despite not knowing her personally. Lola recognized her from some faint memories experienced from her shadow. Upon Nami realizing who Lola was, Lola was embraced by her and given some treasure from the pirate.
Lola then went along with the Straw Hats to where the rest of the Thriller Bark Victim's Association was sunbathing, and to where
Zoro
was being treated by
Chopper
. Within the sunlit ruins of Thriller Bark's Mast Mansion, Lola and everyone within celebrated with a feast that was accompanied by
Brook
playing the piano.
Lola gives Nami a piece of her mother's vivre card.
After two more days of partying, Lola was told by Franky that he had fixed
Brook's ship
and that she and the rest of the Thriller Bark Victim's Association can use it to get off Thriller Bark. Happy about how much more the Straw Hats helped them with this kind gesture, she asked Franky to marry her. He however turned her down saying that since she was a fine gem and he was too super, the match would not be good. As preparations for the Straw Hats next voyage were going underhand and the discussion of
Fish-Man Island
was brought up, Lola was then asked by Nami why she and the rest knew so much about the place. Lola explained that before she and her crew landed on Thriller Bark, they had come from the
New World
through Fish-Man Island. Seeing that Nami was going to New World, Lola tore a piece of her mother's
Vivre Card
and gave it to Nami. She explained how the piece of paper worked and how it would help Nami in the New World by pointing to where Lola's mother, a famous pirate, was. As Lola explained this to Nami, Luffy took out the Vivre Card that Ace gave him and showed it to Lola and the rest. Upon seeing the burnt state that it was in however, Lola and the rest were shocked and were worried by the sight.
Despite seeing the shriveled up Vivre Card, this did not deter Lola and the rest of the Thriller Bark Victim's Association from bidding a happy farewell to their saviors. As the Straw Hats sailed off, Lola thought she saw something move within the fog of the Florian Triangle that was behind Thriller Bark. Despite this phenomenon, Lola decided that it did not matter, as she and her companions decided then that they would never return to such a dark place ever again.
