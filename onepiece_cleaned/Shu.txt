Appearance

Shu in his youth as a Marine.
He wears a veil across his mouth and what appears to be a Newsboy cap version of the standard Marine uniform cap or a turban. His hair can be barely spotted, growing out from under his cap. The Marine jacket he drapes over his shoulder only reached to his waist, and seems much thinner than the standard, as well as much shorter, barely reaching his waist level.
Personality

]
As a Marine, Shu has a strong sense of justice. It is unknown whether he believes in moral justice or absolute justice.
In the anime, he was confident against swordsmen and their weapons, taking on
Roronoa Zoro
without a shred of fear despite witnessing him defeating many other Marines beforehand.
