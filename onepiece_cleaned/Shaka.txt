What is the significance of Shaka's futuristic punk tech helmet in One Piece?
Shaka's helmet in One Piece is a futuristic metal piece marked with the number 01, reminiscent of the style worn by French techno pop musician, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punk. The rest of Shaka's attire, notably a long dark blue coat with yellow patterns and large black DOM shoes, covers most of his body. The technology incorporated in Shaka's helmet and gear is an attempt to replicate the lost technologies of a kingdom from the Void Century.

Appearance
[
]
Shaka is an average-sized man, standing at about the same height as Sanji. His head was covered by a futuristic metal helmet bearing the number 01 over the face. He wears a very long dark blue coat with yellow patterns; the jacket has the words "Vegapunk 01" written at the bottom, "Caution" written on the left sleeve and two light blue horizontal stripes on the right side. He also worn a pair of very large black DOM shoes that ran all the way up to where his jacket ends, leaving little to no skin exposed.
After his body's destruction, Shaka survived by reconvening into Edison's body, who reconstructed the combined Vegapunk with Edison's head, Atlas's left arm, Pythagoras's right arm, and Shaka's torso and legs.
Personality
[
]
Being designated the "good" satellite of Vegapunk, Shaka was extremely reasonable, collected and thoughtful. During
Lilith
's confrontation with the
Straw Hat Pirates
, Shaka was shown to be extremely observant of the crew's mannerisms and abilities, and quickly conveyed to Lilith that she had blundered. Shaka did not approve of Lilith looting and pillaging from others, saying such actions are detrimental to a scientist's pride.
Although not as antagonistic as Lilith, Shaka was very cautious and careful when facing potential dangers. Even when asking the Straw Hat Pirates for assistance in helping Vegapunk escape, he still immobilized them with DOM shoes until he grew confident enough to trust them.
He was loyal to the Stella, the original Vegapunk, believing that it is their duties as his Satellites to ensure his safety, even if at the cost of their lives.
Shaka showed a level of fearlessness, immediately agreeing to sacrifice his life with Stella and Pythagoras in helping to record and transmit a broadcast regarding the Void Century.
Relationships
[
]
Satellites
[
]
While Vegapunk's satellites all refer to themselves as Vegapunk, they each exemplify only one part of Vegapunk's personality and all have their own wills and desires. Therefore, they are effectively six unique people.
Stella
[
]
As the first satellite created by Vegapunk, Shaka had an presumably close relationship with Stella. He would often advise Stella and would in turn follow any recommendations Stella would give, including willing to sacrifice his own life for the greater good of humanity.
Lilith
[
]
Because they are directly contrasting counterparts, Shaka and Lilith tended to argue frequently. Shaka usually disapproved of Lilith's impulsive tendencies and voiced his concerns about them in an attempt to rein her in from making complicated situations worse.
Shaka's virtuous, contained personality overall tended to greatly annoy Lilith, who often mocked his fellow satellite for his "goody-goody" attitude. Lilith also hated when Shaka started acting as her superior by ordering her around, angrily replying for him to knock it off.
Lilith mourned Shaka after his apparent death due to
York
's betrayal.
Pythagoras
[
]
Shaka was often seen working alongside his fellow satellite Pythagoras, implying they had a cordial relationship.
York
[
]
While Shaka's relationship with York can be presumed to have been cordial, he was betrayed and shot by her in a surprise attack.
Little did York know, Shaka along with Pythagoras and Vegapunk were aware of her betrayal of stealing a portion of the
Mother Flame
.
After the
Egghead Incident
, he was revived with Edison’s help, and he along with the rest of satellite share their disdain for York that they destroyed all of York’s spare parts that she cannot get revived if she gets killed.
Others
[
]
Monkey D. Dragon
[
]
Shaka is in contact with the
Revolutionary Army
leader
Monkey D. Dragon
for unknown reasons. When Shaka predicted that his death was imminent, he called Dragon to inform him of this fact.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being a satellite of Vegapunk, Shaka has likely been a contributor to the genius scientist’s numerous technological developments. Shaka appears to be able to share senses with other satellites, allowing them to know what was going on with Lilith while she was out at sea.
Shaka's analytical skills are a boon in combat situations, as they were able to prevent Lilith from foolishly attacking the Straw Hats by quickly pointing out the crew’s capabilities and strategic mindset.
Even compared to the other Vegapunks, Shaka is capable of thinking quickly and using his analytical skills effectively as he was the only one to notice changes in the neutron flux and density numbers related to the Mother Flame, surmising one of the Vegapunks was a traitor, something the main Vegapunk body, Stella, wasn't capable of doing so fast.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
During a visit to
Mary Geoise
, either in person or as a memory of
Vegapunk
, Shaka experienced the cruelty of the
World Nobles
.
When Shaka,
Pythagoras
, and Stella discovered odd discrepancies in the
Mother Flame
's energy output, Shaka quickly deduced that the culprit logically must be one of the Vegapunks, and that the three of them were the only ones that had alibis. The three concluded that they would have to continue observing in order to get more information. One week later, Pythagoras revealed that he had discovered the culprit to be
York
, citing that her memories uploaded to
Punk Records
were invalid and that the
Den Den Mushi
recordings of the
Mother Flame
room had been tampered with. Shaka added on that he had discovered how someone had deployed a
Sea Beast Weapon
without authorization. A day later, the
Lulusia Kingdom
was obliterated through what Vegapunk assumed was an
Ancient Weapon
. Shaka suggested fleeing
Egghead
, but Vegapunk reminded him of the
World Government
's influence over the entire planet, and that escape would be impossible. When Vegapunk explained that their deaths were immanent and likely necessary, Shaka and Pythagoras fearlessly stated their intentions to join him in his plan to reveal their knowledge on the
Void Century
to the world.
Shaka, Pythagoras, and Vegapunk prepare to erase their memories.
A few days later, Shaka assisted Vegapunk in his recording, setting up the Den Den Mushi and expressing his frustration in Vegapunk wishing to wait so long to reveal his message. Realizing that their behaviors would be perceived as strange by the other Vegapunks, the trio decided the best course of action would be to erase their memories, in order to ensure their plans would remain undiscovered. After doing so, the three read a message Vegapunk had written just prior to them, and were naturally shocked by the overload of information that they had just forgotten being revealed once again in such a short time.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
When
Lilith
went out to the nearby sea to attack and pillage the
Straw Hat Pirates
, Shaka called her to question her actions. Shaka stated that Lilith had blundered when confronting the
Emperor's
crew, as the pirates were capable of instantly attacking her and thus had the advantage despite Lilith surrounding them with the
Sea Beast Weapons
. Shaka then told Lilith to bring the Straw Hats to them, expressing an interest in the crew.
Shaka then contacted
Monkey D. Dragon
, informing him of his imminent death and wanting Dragon to hear him out.
Afterwards, Shaka found
Nami
,
Usopp
,
Nico Robin
,
Franky
, and
Sanji
in the laboratory battling
S-Shark
and told the
Seraph
to stand down. He asked the Straw Hats what they thought of the island's technology and revealed that it was actually not futuristic, as a
similarly advanced society
once existed 900 years ago.
Shaka then took the entire group inside the laboratory and began talking about the
Void Century
and its history as well as the
Ohara Incident
and its aftermath. He then found himself in lengthy conversations with Robin about Ohara's value and danger towards the
World Government
, theorizing with her why Ohara was destroyed and how it was related to the Void Century. He also mentioned that everyone holding this knowledge was given a metaphorical death sentence by the World Government, much to the shock of the group. He then continued by explaining
Professor Clover
's background as well as his relationship with both Clover and Dragon and the immediate aftermath of what happened after Ohara was destroyed. When he explained that he visited Ohara shortly after the incident happened, he mentioned
giants
recovering all the books that were saved and bringing them to
Elbaph
. He then mentioned a giant covered in bandages who led the group and, on Robin's question, confirmed that it was
Jaguar D. Saul
. He concluded by confirming that he had read every book retrieved from Ohara, therefore had all the world's mysteries stored inside his brain and continued on researching the world's mysteries on
Egghead
. He then wanted to show the group something else.
From the lab's control room, Shaka showed the group the interactions and conversations
Luffy's
group was having with the real
Vegapunk
. When Shaka was informed about
CP0
's arrival at Egghead, he ordered to let them deliver
S-Bear
and leave Egghead immediately, but told the other Satellites to prepare for fighting CP0.
Shaka heard
Rob Lucci
's question about the various
Cipher Pol
agents disappearing from Egghead, but the Satellites denied any knowledge and still refused CP0 entry. When CP0 ignored the order and infiltrated the island, Shaka ordered the researchers and workers to evacuate and
Atlas
to return to the lab. He also had three Seraphim—S-Shark,
S-Hawk
, and
S-Snake
—mobilized and put under
Sentomaru
's command.
As they watched Luffy fight Lucci, Shaka noted that Lucci had awakened
his Zoan Devil Fruit
but had maintained his personality. Vegapunk then joined the group in the control room and explained his theory about
Devil Fruits
.
Once all of the Straw Hats and the Satellites were safely up in the Labophase, CP0 began cutting off all escape routes from the island. When Lilith suggested fighting CP0 directly, Shaka countered that the Satellites should be willing to sacrifice themselves in order to ensure Stella's safe escape. With Sentomaru incapacitated, Vegapunk decided to contact their secret ally on the island,
Stussy
. Shaka then agreed that Lilith should escort Vegapunk to the
Vegaforce-01
. However, the Frontier Dome suddenly deactivated, and although Shaka and
Pythagoras
managed to restore it, CP0 had infiltrated the Labophase and were attacking the
Thousand Sunny
.
As CP0 approached the lab, Shaka noted that the four Seraphim had taken the initiative and followed the agents up, so he ordered Lilith and
Edison
, who had left to back up Zoro and Brook, to assume command of the Seraphim. Before the Satellites could arrive, Lucci ordered the Seraphim to destroy the lab. As the Seraphim began attacking, Stussy neutralized
Kaku
and Lucci;
however, she reported that she could not override Lucci's command to the Seraphim. The Straw Hats were amazed that Vegapunk had a spy in the World Government's top intelligence agency, but Shaka admitted that it had not been intentional. After Edison successfully stopped the Seraphim, Stussy bound Kaku and Lucci, and Shaka offered to take her with them, which she accepted.
When Luffy was unable to find
Jewelry Bonney
and Vegapunk, Shaka pointed out that the monitors could see her in Room Nikyu but could not see Vegapunk anywhere. Shaka then reported that they had lost control of the Frontier Dome, so he suggested that the others search for Stella while he worked on restoring control of the dome.
After an explosion went off in Building C, Shaka lost contact with Pythagoras, who had been searching in the area, and watched in shock as the location's Cameko was destroyed. Luffy and Shaka then noticed that they were losing communication with the others and Cameko-feeds across the labs. S-Bear and S-Hawk then came to the control room and attacked Zoro, Lucci, and Kaku. Shaka ordered them to stop, but when they ignored him and continued attacking, Luffy moved Shaka to safety. Shaka reasoned that someone like Vegapunk must have given the Seraphim an order and that the whole situation was orchestrated to kill all of them.
When Lucci and Kaku insisted on being set free so they could help fight the Seraphim, Shaka questioned what CP0's mission was, and Lucci freely admitted that they sought to assassinate Vegapunk and the Satellites. Shaka also reasoned that Lucci planned to pay back Stussy for her betrayal, which Lucci confirmed. Despite the danger, Shaka willingly put the decision in Luffy's hands but reiterated that Luffy needed to protect Stella, and Luffy decided to free the agents.
Shaka is shot after finding Stella.
As the four struggled to fight the two Seraphim, Zoro compared their resiliency to
King
, and Shaka was surprised to learn that the
Beasts Pirates
had a
lunarian
member. After confirming to the others that the Seraphim had been augmented with lunarian blood, Shaka went off on his own to locate Stella. In the old Devil Fruit Reasearch Lab on the basement floor, Shaka discovered the missing Cipher Pol agents and Stella; however, before he could free them, Shaka was shot in the head by
York
.
Shaka's consciousness was later placed into Edison's body, alongside Atlas and Pythagoras, and they later contacted
Haredas
for an unspecified reason.
