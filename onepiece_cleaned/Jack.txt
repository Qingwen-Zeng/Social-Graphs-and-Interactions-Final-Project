Jack the Drought
is a
giant grouper
fish-man
,
an All-Star of the
Beasts Pirates
as one of
Kaidou
's three closest
confidants
, and captain of the
Mammoth
, prior to its destruction.
He was formerly considered to be the ruler of
Kuri
in
Wano Country
.
He was first briefly mentioned when being notified of
Caesar Clown
's capture by viewers of Caesar's broadcast of the
Punk Hazard incident
.
Due to his actions and role, he is the main antagonist of the
Zou Arc
, and a major antagonist in the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Jack is a giant grouper fish-man of massive stature, dwarfing his crewmates and standing taller than even his governor-general
Kaidou
.
Unlike the majority of fish-men, his pale skin is identical to that of a human, making it easy to mistake him for one. While still being immensely muscular, Jack's limbs are disproportionately small when compared to his enormous torso (though their size is greatly increased in the anime, especially his arms). He wears a metallic jaw mask that seemingly disappears when he transforms into his mammoth form, and has a pair of horns on each side of his head. His blond hair is worn in a ponytail and a pair of long braids. He wears a light brown (darker in the anime) sleeveless feathery coat similar to Kaidou with spiked pauldrons on his shoulders, circled by a belt bearing his crew's Jolly Roger.
During his fight against
Inuarashi
, this Jolly Roger was destroyed after being pierced by the latter's final attack.
He has bloodshot orange eyes and a veined forehead.
He has two piercings in his right ear, and wears spiked pauldrons on his shoulders.
He carries a pair of tusks around his neck which are actually sheathes containing his scythe-like blades.
His mouth contains puffed lips and pointed teeth like some fish-man
but while in his mammoth form he has square teeth.
When using Koro on the Minks, he wears a hazmat suit and wears a glass helmet around his head.
Personality
[
]
Jack displaying his wrathful nature.
Jack is violent and short-tempered, as one of his subordinates worried how Jack would react once he learned about
Caesar
's downfall.
He threatened to destroy an entire city should he not get what he wanted,
and made good on his word,
saying that it was the citizens' own fault because they did not comply.
His ruthlessness extends to even attacking children and the elderly.
He has even admitted that he has a love for causing destruction, even when there is no real benefit to it. Those who have witnessed Jack's personality in person describe these traits as madness.
He is also extremely sadistic, willing to torture enemies in order to get what he wants. He is barbaric and brutal to the point of hacking off limbs and creating terrible bloodshed,
only ceasing his carnage when he has more urgent matters to attend to.
When Jack attacked the giant elephant
Zunesha
, he was determined to get to its head and came up with several horrendously cruel things he and his underlings could do to kill it.
He is extremely stubborn and unreasonable. When the minks tried to tell him that
Raizo
was not on
Zou
, Jack refused to listen to or believe them,
and continued to refuse when Inuarashi offered to let him search the island without any resistance to see for himself.
This, along with him disregarding his crew's comment that attacking
Doflamingo
's convoy was dangerous,
proves that he refuses to listen to logic, to the point where he actually becomes enraged when someone tries to reason with him, having no patience for civil conversations.
Jack's lack of reason makes him very headstrong and reckless, as he decided to attack a convoy of four Marine ships, which were carrying powerful Marines, to rescue Doflamingo.
He is not above fighting dirty in order to achieve his goals, as he brought in Caesar's gas weapon,
Koro
, to annihilate Zou after the minks put up a formidable fight against his forces, simply because he was losing his patience and not because he was in any actual danger of losing.
He is also strategic, and desires to use the most effective methods possible to win. Upon his return to Zou, he decided to outright kill
Zunesha
, the elephant carrying Zou, to destroy the country in the quickest way he could and avoid having to fight the minks again while ensuring they were finished off for good. Jack is very thorough in battle, wanting to make sure his opponents are completely annihilated and presuming that they will return to full strength otherwise. Additionally, he does not tolerate it when his subordinates fail their missions, having brutally punished Sheepshead for not finding Raizo.
Despite his brutal and sadistic tendencies, Jack has no love for mindless violence, as he became greatly concerned when Kaidou went on a drunk rampage through Kuri and threatened the citizens that Jack valued as factory workers. He also acts respectfully to those who are not his enemies and have done nothing to annoy him.
He can be subservient to those he acknowledges as stronger than him, such as his fellow All-Stars
King
and
Queen
, accepting insults from them and only replying with a quiet apology,
or outright fearing his general Kaidou.
Jack does not appear to care about titles or fame, as he got annoyed with his subordinates for boasting about his position and bounty.
However, he is still prideful, as he got angry when he read the news report about his apparent death.
Although Jack is normally calm and immovable, he is still capable of feeling real fear if he is vastly overpowered and left in a helpless situation. When Zunesha swung its trunk at him and his fleet in order to repel them, Jack began sweating in fear and watched the massive limb darken the sky above his fleet with his eyes bulging in panic.
Jack even trembled in the face of his general
Kaidou
.
Likewise, he was rather apprehensive when Queen brought
Big Mom
to
Onigashima
.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Jack's subordinates are incredibly loyal to him,
but whether Jack respects his subordinates or not is largely unknown. He does seem to become annoyed with them at times, such as when they mentioned his bounty to the minks.
He has also put them in unnecessary danger at times, having ordered them to attack the powerful minks when they could have entered peacefully. However, his subordinates also seem to love battle to some degree and did not have any protesting opinions.
When Jack decided to attack Doflamingo's Marine escort, they were scared of the Marines' power and advised Jack to turn back, but he became annoyed and ignored their pleas.
They appear to be very proud of Jack's reputation and bounty, ranting about it to the Mink Tribe.
However, one of Jack's crewmates was scared of what he would do after he found out about Caesar Clown's defeat, suggesting a relationship of both respect and fear.
Jack does not tolerate it when his subordinates fail a mission or end it prematurely, as he severely punished Sheepshead for leaving Zou without finding Raizo, with
Ginrummy
who is too afraid to reveal that they ended the mission because the Straw Hat Pirates drove them off.
He is also very sarcastic towards them when they say things he feels obvious or stupid.
Kaidou
[
]
Jack is one of Kaidou's three right-hand men, implying that the
Emperor
has great trust in him and his power.
However, upon hearing of Jack's failure to rescue Doflamingo, Kaidou seemed more concerned with the loss of his SMILE supply than with the loss of his subordinate.
Jack is shown to be afraid of his superior as when Kaidou appeared in dragon form, Jack trembled.
While stern and sometimes outright cruel to his subordinates, Jack remains subservient to those of higher rank or strength than him, such as fearing Kaidou's drunk temper and promising to heed his command of locating the enemy.
Also, despite his own bloodthirsty and stubborn nature, Jack believes his own captain is completely insane especially when drunk.
Kaidou, though seeing Jack as one of his three confidants, did not hesitate in giving the lower ranking Tobiroppo a chance to kill any All-Star of their choice to take their position, as the crew's hierarchy is determined by an individual's power. Jack, on the other hand, did not complain.
Kaidou does have some compassion for Jack, as after Jack was badly wounded by the
Sulong
-transformed
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
, he stepped in before their battle could continue and commended Jack for keeping the other Sulong minks in line, and had him step back so Jack could recover from his injures.
King and Queen
[
]
Even though Jack is looked down on and insulted by the two of them, he does not seem to resent but respect them instead. Having been a member since childhood, Jack respectfully calls them "Big Brothers", showing that they are superior to him. This was shown when he apologized to
King
and
Queen
when they insult him by calling him "Jack the Stooge" with an angered expression. Jack is shown to accept their mockery and does not protest. He is considered by them to be the weakest of the three All-Stars and was constantly looked down by them for it.
Allies
[
]
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
Via Kaidou, Jack is allied with
Donquixote Doflamingo
, and was willing to retrieve the former
Warlord of the Sea
from the Marine convoy carrying him, despite the powerful Marines guarding him.
It was Doflamingo's defeat and capture that made Jack abandon Zou before he could completely destroy what was left of the island.
Enemies
[
]
Mink Tribe
[
]
Jack was responsible for torturing several
minks
and laying waste to the
Mokomo Dukedom
.
As such, he became hated and feared by the Mink Tribe, who have no intention of ever forgiving him;
this also extends to
Pekoms
of the
Big Mom Pirates
, who was enraged that Jack ransacked his homeland.
After failing to rescue Doflamingo, Jack returned to Zou with the intention on exterminating the minks completely just to prevent them from seeking revenge.
During the Fire Festival, he fought the Mink Tribe again on top of the Skull Dome at
Onigashima
, but this time, they battled against him in their Sulong forms. Though Jack defeated a majority of the minks, they severely injured him.
After partially recovering from his injuries, Jack later would later re-encounter Inuarashi again down in the Treasure Repository and the mink leader decided to settle the score with him solo.
Later taking their fight to the courtyard and while Inuarashi was able to briefly gain the advantage by transforming into his Sulong form again,
only to be badly hurt upon losing his Sulong form where Jack admitted he would have been beaten by one more direct hit, Inuarashi was able to regain his Sulong form and finish off Jack once and for all with
Oden One Sword Style: Inu Spire
.
Raizo
[
]
Due to
Raizo
's connection with the Kouzuki Family and Kaidou's goal in obtaining the secret his master,
Kouzuki Oden
, possessed,
Jack went to great lengths to find the ninja and nearly reduced an entire country to rubble in the process.
Zunesha
[
]
During his second attack on Zou, Jack decided to slaughter the minks by bringing down the giant elephant carrying their civilization, Zunesha.
He planned to force the elephant to its knees in order to reach its head and kill it in sadistic ways. However, Zunesha was determined to protect the minks and with
Momonosuke
's help, it gained permission to attack and annihilated Jack's fleet with one swing of its trunk. When Zunesha was swinging its trunk, Jack was left paralyzed in extreme fear as it destroys his fleet.
Ashura Doji
[
]
To the Beasts Pirates,
Ashura Doji
is well known as Shutenmaru. In their meeting, Jack brought up how Kaidou wanted the thief to be a subordinate of the Beasts Pirates. Ashura refused and had no qualms in attacking Jack, with both dealing serious wounds to each other.
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
As
Big Mom
is a rival of his
general
, Jack sees her as an enemy. He was more apprehensive than dominating when in her presence, even questioning Queen's motive for bringing her to their base of operation.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being an All-Star of the
Beasts Pirates
, Jack has great authority over his crew just below his
Governor-General
.
Jack also had authority over the region of
Kuri
in
Wano Country
, and its residents greatly feared him.
In spite of his great strength, Jack is implied to be weaker than fellow All-Stars
King
and
Queen
, who both looked down upon him.
Alongside King, Jack was confident in his ability to defeat any member of the Tobiroppo, the six strongest Shinuchi of their pirate organization and mighty combatants in their own right, if challenged.
Like the other All-Stars, he is dreaded as a calamity. His epithet is named for the fact that when he rampages on an island, it is left in a decaying state like it is suffering a drought.
His bounty of
1,000,000,000 indicates that the World Government considers him extremely dangerous and threatening to their operations.
He managed to sink two of the four Marine battleships that were part of Doflamingo's escort, and despite ultimately being defeated by the entire fleet carrying
Vice Admiral
Tsuru
,
Admiral
Fujitora
, and former
Fleet Admiral
Sengoku
;
Jack survived the battle while only sustaining minor injuries.
During the war on Onigashima, Jack also bested several
minks
in sulong form before facing
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
(the two strongest minks in Zou), transformed at the same time, though in the end he was completely defeated.
Physical Abilities
[
]
He possesses tremendous strength and stamina, which is enhanced by his fish-man heritage. He has also fought with the Mink Tribe, including its two rulers
Inuarashi
and Nekomamushi, for five days and five nights without rest. Despite this, he had to use a chemical weapon to finally defeat them all.
Jack was shown to possess tremendous durability, having survived being hit by Zunesha's trunk and only briefly losing consciousness despite the force being enough to demolish his entire fleet.
During the war on Onigashima, Jack was heavily injured by the Mink Tribe's forces which had activated
Sulong
, but in the span of an hour he managed to recover enough to go and attack the wounded Nine Red Scabbards, believing he had a better chance of killing them than even a fully healthy Tobiroppo like
Black Maria
.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Jack is highly proficient in dual wielding his Shotel blades, able to fight equally with Nekomamushi and Inuarashi, the two strongest minks in the Mokomo Dukedom, in one-on-one combat. He was also capable of fighting evenly against the renowned thief
Shutenmaru
, whom even Kaidou had taken an interest in, and managed to injure Shutenmaru before their fight was cut short. Notably, even though Shutenmaru had managed to cut off most of the blade on one of his shotels, Jack was still able to fight competently with the short remainder of its blade.
In the anime, he was shown able to use flying slash attacks at a rapid continuous pace against Shutenmaru.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Zou Zou no Mi, Model: Mammoth
Jack's full mammoth form.
Jack ate the Zou Zou no Mi, Model: Mammoth, an
Ancient Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a full mammoth and a mammoth hybrid at will. Since he is a Devil Fruit user, he has lost the ability to swim, but because he is a fish-man, he can breathe underwater. Though, he still would not be able to move if he falls into the water.
As a Zoan, this power grants him a significant boost to his physical abilities, granting him immense strength and size. In his full mammoth form, he was able to level part of a city by simply swinging his trunk,
knock steel gates off their hinges, and leave footprints in rock. Jack also gains a tremendous boost in his durability and endurance; he was able to fend off attacks from numerous minks while they were in their
Sulong
forms,
though he ultimately fell at the hands of the mink rulers, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, and he did sustain significant injuries in the process.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Jack possesses the ability to use
Armament
and
Observation Haki
.
Despite this, he has never been seen using either in combat, being more reliant on his Devil Fruit.
Weapons
[
]
Blades
[
]
Jack's blades.
Jack wields two blades which he uses when in his fish-man form. He keeps them hidden and sheathed as the tusks around his neck. Though they resemble
Shotels
when seen from the side, they appear even more twisted, akin to his mammoth tusks, when viewed from the front.
Koro
[
]
Jack had access to
Koro
, Caesar Clown's poison gas weapon, during his invasion of Zou.
He used its power to overwhelm the minks and destroy Kurau City after losing his patience from five days of battling. He (and the platoon he brought along with) also had a hazmat suit to protect himself from the gas.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Jack was born 28 years ago on the
Grand Line
.
Wano Takeover
[
]
Twenty years ago,
King
,
Queen
, and Jack were present when
Kaidou
set Oden Castle ablaze in order to kill the
Kouzuki Family
with Jack only being eight years old at the time.
At some point, due to being a fish-man, Jack was able to quickly discover the
Road Poneglyph
in the submerged part of
Wano Country
.
At a certain time afterwards, Jack acquired and consumed the
Zou Zou no Mi, Model: Mammoth
, allowing him to transform into a mammoth, but losing his ability to swim.
During the Timeskip
[
]
Jack attacks the Mokomo Dukedom.
Seventeen days before
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Trafalgar Law
's arrival at
Zou
, Jack and
his men
broke through the gate to the
Mokomo Dukedom
, leaving it in ruins and severely injuring the guards. Jack and
Sheepshead
told the minks to hand over a ninja known as
Raizo
. The minks did not comply, causing an irritated Jack to destroy several buildings with his trunk. As the minks still denied any knowledge of Raizo, Jack ordered the Pleasures to lay waste to the country. However, the minks easily fended them off with
Electro
, and
Monjii
warned Jack that every mink was a natural-born warrior ready to fight. When Monjii asked Jack to talk with the duke, Jack refused before ordering the Gifters to attack.
Jack battles Inuarashi.
As Jack's subordinates were battling the Musketeer Squad, Duke
Inuarashi
arrived to confront Jack himself. Inuarashi tried to reason with Jack by promising that he would be allowed to search for the ninja if he ceased the destruction, but Jack responded by attacking Inuarashi with his trunk. After Inuarashi easily blocked the strike, he and Jack fought until 6pm arrived. After Inuarashi and his group left the battlefield, Master
Nekomamushi
arrived and slammed Jack into the ground, prompting Jack to return to his fish-man form and prepare to continue the battle.
Jack uses Koro to claim victory over the Mokomo Dukedom.
The battle against the
Mink Tribe
lasted for five days, with Inuarashi and Nekomamushi's forces taking turns fighting with each passing day and night. Even though the minks had the upper hand against Jack's continuous forces, they were unable to overwhelm Jack himself. On the fifth day of the battle, Jack finally lost his patience and used
Koro
to claim victory by poisoning the minks. With the Mink Tribe rendered helpless, Jack tortured the strongest of them for information concerning Raizo, taking a leg from Inuarashi and an arm from Nekomamushi. The following day, Jack heard about
Doflamingo
's defeat and capture and promptly left Zou to rescue him, leaving behind some of his subordinates.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
A few days later, Jack tailed the four
Marine Ships
that were escorting Doflamingo to
Impel Down
. Despite warnings that powerful
Marines
were guarding him, Jack refused to leave and prepared to attack the Marine ships.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Zou Arc
[
]
Jack reading about his apparent death following Doflamingo's failed rescue.
After the attack on Doflamingo's Marine escort, it was reported that Jack succeeded in sinking two of the ships, but ultimately fell to the Marines. However, the news was unable to completely confirm his death.
Contrary to what was reported, Jack survived the battle, but sustained some injuries, resulting in him being bandaged and resting after the fight. While sailing back to Zou with his fleet and his damaged ship, Jack read the newspaper that explained his supposed death before angrily shredding it.
When Sheepshead and his group returned to Jack with a report that Raizo was not at Zou, Jack was displeased and brutally punished Sheepshead before hanging him upside down. Soon afterward, Jack returned to Zou, intending to completely annihilate the Mink Tribe by killing the
giant elephant
carrying Zou.
Jack being hit by Zunesha's trunk.
Jack commenced his attack, having his men assault the elephant's leg with cannon fire. However,
Kouzuki Momonosuke
ordered Zunesha to attack the Beasts Pirates. Obeying Momonosuke, the elephant attacked, swinging its trunk at the fleet. Jack stared at the advancing trunk frozen in complete terror, incapable of doing anything to stop the attack, while his subordinates fled for their lives. Zunesha's trunk struck Jack, shattering his mask and knocking him out, and all of his ships were sunk in a single blow.
Jack sunk underwater with the fleet's wreckage, but was still alive. Immobilized in the ocean due to being a Devil Fruit user, Jack impatiently waited for someone to pull him out.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Jack was eventually rescued from his predicament, and he returned to Wano Country prior to Luffy's arrival.
He was notified about
Holed'em
's defeat at the hands of Luffy and
Roronoa Zoro
.
Jack struck by "Shutenmaru."
Jack later went to Okobore Town to search for Luffy, but he encountered a thief known as
Shutenmaru
. Jack told the thief to become Kaidou's subordinate, but the latter responded by slicing Jack, initiating a fight. The duel was interrupted when Kaidou appeared and ordered Jack to bring Luffy and Law to him.
Jack then noticed that Kaidou was drunk and was afraid that he would go on a rampage. Hawkins then arrived and directed Kaidou's attention to Oden Castle before explaining to Jack his reasons for doing so. After Kaidou destroyed Oden Castle, Jack commented that Kaidou was crazy.
Back at
Onigashima
, Jack was scolded by fellow All-Stars
King
and
Queen
because the offerings from Kuri had been decreasing lately. Cowering at the presence of his superiors, all Jack could do was quietly apologize.
After Big Mom was brought to Onigashima, Jack questioned why Queen brought her to the island, and Queen angrily answered that communications in
Udon
were cut off. The three All-Stars watched as Kaidou had Big Mom released and then clashed with her.
During the beginning stages of the
Fire Festival
, Jack participated in a meeting with Kaidou, King and the Tobiroppo. Kaidou gave the Tobiroppo the mission of finding his son
Yamato
and offered to let them challenge the All-Stars for their positions should they succeed, to which both Jack and King had no objection.
Later, Jack appeared beside his fellow All-Stars as well as Kaidou himself on the Live Stage of the Golden Kagura, as Kaidou declared his intention to "liven up" the execution of Momonosuke with the announcement of the
New Onigashima Project
.
Jack is temporarily incapacitated by Inuarashi and Nekomamushi in their Sulong forms.
As Kaidou prepared to execute Momonosuke after disposing of Orochi, the All-Stars and Kaidou were taken by surprise when the
Red Scabbards
and
Izou
suddenly appeared and launched an all-out attack.
After Kaidou flew to the roof of the Skull Dome with the Scabbards, Jack and an army went there to support Kaidou. They then prepared to fight the minks after they transformed into their
Sulong
forms.
In the ensuing clash, Jack sustained numerous injuries from fighting the minks. He was then attacked by Inuarashi and Nekomamushi.
Though Jack defeated most of the minks, he and his platoon were ultimately overwhelmed, prompting Kaidou to step in before Jack could be killed. Kaidou then told Jack to rest and tend to his wounds.
After partially recovering from his injuries, Jack decided to head to the Scabbards' current location, which was the treasure room on the second floor, and kill the samurai himself.
When he arrived, Inuarashi confronted Jack alone so that the other Scabbards could proceed. Jack noted that Inuarashi would be unable to use his Sulong form while within the castle, to which Inuarashi replied Jack wouldn't have access to his chemical weapons either.
While the two fought, Jack's underlings kept Inuarashi exhausted while he tried to fight the All-Star, until the Gifters began turning on the other members of the crew thanks to
Tama
, confusing Jack.
Jack is defeated by Inuarashi.
Transforming into his hybrid form, Jack charged towards Inuarashi, mockingly urging him to give up and accept death, and that he forgave the Minks for their lies to defend
Raizo
. Inuarashi grabbed Jack by his trunk and used Jack's momentum and weight to throw him through the wall of the treasure room and into a courtyard. As Jack returned to his feet, Inuarashi approached him and transformed into his Sulong form thanks to a hole in the roof of the Skull Dome.
Jack receives many wounds from Inuarashi in his Sulong form, but after the moon gets covered by storm clouds by Kaidou, Inuarashi returns to normal, giving Jack the window to turn the tide in his favor, even saying that if had received one more hit, he would have lost. Unfortunately for him, the clouds are moved away by the advanced grade
Supreme King Haki
from Luffy and Kaidou's clash, which allowed Inuarashi to regain his Sulong form and finally defeat Jack with
Oden One Sword Style: Inu Spire
, which pierces his stomach and renders him unconscious.
