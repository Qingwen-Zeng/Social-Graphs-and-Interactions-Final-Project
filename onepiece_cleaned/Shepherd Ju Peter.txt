For the anime-only Marine commander, see
Shepherd
.
Saint Shepherd Ju Peter
is a
World Noble
and one of the
Five Elders
who publicly head the
World Government
,
holding the title of
Warrior God of Agriculture
.
Due to his actions and role, he is one of the secondary antagonists of the
Egghead Arc
. Along with the other Elders, he is one of the main antagonists of the
Final Saga
and one of the overarching antagonists of the
One Piece
series.
Appearance
[
]
Peter is a tan-skinned man of lean build and incredible stature, being the second tallest of the Five Elders after
Marcus Mars
(and noticeably taller than
Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
, hence well over 3 m tall).
He has white (blond in the anime and colored manga) hair that is kept in a short taper cut while linking to a chin curtain beard and mustache. Among the Elders, Peter stands out as the youngest-looking, with barely any facial wrinkles visible.
For attire, Peter dons a plain suit jacket and pants of black (dark-maroon in the anime and colored manga) color, paired with a white, buttoned-up, tieless dress shirt that has a wingtip collar low enough to expose a scar above his chest, which reaches from his lower cervical area down toward his right armpit.
Personality
[
]
Like the other Elders, Peter cares about the world's balance upheld by the
Three Great Powers
and wishes to protect it, expressly seeking to prevent the chaos that would arise from its breakdown.
He has been shown to give great thought to the impact of vacancies created among both the
Seven Warlords
and
Four Emperors
. He also wishes to preserve the image of the
World Government
by keeping the events of the
Void Century
a secret at all costs, and he and the other Elders will immediately have anyone destroyed who is found to be studying it; notably, Peter was the one who frantically gave the order to kill Professor
Clover
of
Ohara
, doing so to prevent the latter from uttering the
Great Kingdom
's name.
Like his fellow Elders, Peter is knowledgeable regarding the true nature of the
Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika
and takes said
Devil Fruit
's threat quite seriously. When
Warcury
made note of its legendary status, Peter responded by questioning why the government made the effort of renaming a Devil Fruit.
Although he will totally obey Imu's orders, he did not shy away from questioning the reasoning behind eliminating an entire country, though he did proceed the process regardless of the question and executed Imu's orders.
Peter was also rather shocked that Imu had replaced Saturn with
Figarland Garling
as one of the Five Elders in the aftermath of the
Egghead Incident
without letting the others know beforehand.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of the Five Elders, the highest-ranking
Celestial Dragons
, Peter and his four peers are considered the "Highest Authority of the
World Government
",
though in secret are subservient to
Imu
, the occupant of the
Empty Throne
.
Peter thus controls every part of the government, including but not limited to the
Cipher Pol
agencies and
Marine HQ
, with even the
Fleet Admiral
unable to challenge the Elder's power.
Like anyone of, or above, the rank of
Marine Admiral
, the Five Elders can declare a
Buster Call
to destroy any island deemed a threat, as well as deploy the
Mother Flame
on behalf of Imu to annihilate islands without a trace.
The Elders can also channel their tremendous power to manipulate the media, such as to withhold facts from the general public or outright erase segments of history, most notably regarding the Void Century.
Peter, along with the other Elders are endowed with total authority over the
Pacifista
and
Seraphim
(above even their creator, Dr.
Vegapunk
's, though due to Vegapunk's secret meddling, their authority over all Kuma-formed Pacifista is second to
Jewelry Bonney
).
Peter has tremendous willpower, remaining conscious from
Joy Boy
's
Supreme King Haki
released by
Emet
, which was powerful enough to knock out every Vice Admiral in a huge range.
Unique Powers
[
]
As one of the Five Elders, Peter has demonstrated some esoteric abilities. Which of these, if any, stem from his
Devil Fruit
is currently unclear:
Peter appears to have some form of telepathy, at least with his other Elders. The Elders were able to communicate with Saturn who was as far away as Egghead, while they were at Mary Geoise.
Peter arrived on Egghead by being summoned through a "
magic circle
"
(
魔法陣
,
mahōjin
?
)
on the ground as if through a portal; said circle had a pentagram in its middle and five unknown numbers in-between its jags. It is unclear if Peter can make use of these portals on his own as Saturn did when he arrived on Egghead, or if Saturn's presence is required to invoke the portal.
At least in his
Zoan
form, Peter can heal from injuries. He survived being decapited by
Dorry
and
Brogy
and was able to reform his severed body parts, with
Monkey D. Luffy
describing him and the other Elders as being immortal.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Peter's Awakened Beast Form.
Peter sucking up his surroundings...
... just to spit everything out later on.
Peter acquired the power of a
Mythical Zoan
-type
Sandworm
(
サンドワーム
,
Sandowāmu
?
)
Devil Fruit
, which lets him transform into a giant sandworm and a human-sandworm hybrid at will. Peter appears to have "
awakened
" this ability while maintaining his personality, as indicated by the ribbon of dark, flaming smoke around his head and torso when he is transformed.
In this form, he could withstand a point-blank
fire blast
from
Sabo
without trouble,
and utilizing the immense size of his full Beast Form, Peter can swallow his opponents whole.
This fruit also grants him a powerful vacuum breath ability that can encompass a whole island and its surroundings, with such force that even giants could not escape from it, although sufficiently large objects can be shoved into Peter's mouth to neutralize the ability.
Additionally, he can spit out everything he previously sucked into his mouth high into the air onto the ground, potentially lethally injuring whoever was sucked in unless they are caught by someone.
Furthermore, he can dig through the earth with ease, emerging whenever he wants and catching anyone above him unguarded and unprepared.
The massive mouth he gains also enables him to bite through even the hardest of substances, such as the metal body of the
Iron Giant
.
Haki
[
]
Further information:
Haki
Like the other Elders, Peter possesses powerful Haki. His arrival on Egghead was accompanied by a massive burst of Haki which resembled black lightning. His and the other Elders' Haki was sensed by
Roronoa Zoro
and
Rob Lucci
.
Observation Haki
[
]
Peter is a very skilled user of
Observation Haki
, as he was able to sense
Luffy
's and
Bonney
's transformations into
Nika
.
Weapons
[
]
Peter carries a
flintlock
with him, which he intended to use to execute
Nefertari Cobra
for seeing Imu.
History
[

Past
[
]
As recognition for his genius inventions in
MADS
,
Dr. Vegapunk
was invited to
Mary Geoise
for an audience with the
Five Elders
.
Peter, Warcury, and Mars listen to Professor Clover's demands.
Twenty-two years ago, the Five Elders spoke via
Den Den Mushi
to Professor
Clover
, an
archaeologist
from
Ohara
who was revealed to have been studying the
Poneglyphs
. Clover revealed that he knew too much about the
Void Century
, and Peter immediately ordered for the
Cipher Pol
unit on Ohara to eliminate him. The Five Elders then gave the command for a
Buster Call
to destroy Ohara and its historians.
Less than fourteen years ago (over ten years since
Gol D. Roger
's execution),
Spandam
persuaded the Five Elders to give him the authority to seek out the blueprints for
Pluton
.
Sky Island Saga
[
]
Jaya Arc
[
]
A Marine came to the Room of Authority to report that
Shanks
had made contact with
Whitebeard
. However, the Five Elders' top priority was finding a replacement for
Crocodile
in the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, with Peter saying that they could not allow the
Three Great Powers
to crumble.
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Long Ring Long Land Arc
[
]
The Five Elders got a call that Marine
Admiral
Aokiji
had gone off on his own without informing anyone, to their dismay.
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
The Five Elders received a report that the
Emperor
Shanks
had successfully met with fellow Emperor
Whitebeard
, to their shock.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Post-War Arc
[
]
The Five Elders spoke about the aftermath of the
Summit War of Marineford
, and said to wait for pirates to emerge in the changing
New World
when considering potential new Warlord candidates. They then talked about
Blackbeard
's rise to power, and Peter said that little could likely stop him aside from the other Emperors and the remnants of the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Peter and the other Elders talk with Sakazuki.
Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
came to the Room of Authority to question the Five Elders about why they let
Donquixote Doflamingo
use the
World Nobles
' authority to misinform the entire world. The Elders reminded Sakazuki of his place and reprimanded his insolence, with Peter stating that the matter had been entrusted to Cipher Pol. A Marine then came in and revealed that
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Trafalgar Law
's alliance had taken down Doflamingo, and that their victory had been broadcast to the entire world, shocking the elders and Sakazuki alike.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Levely Arc
[
]
Peter and the other Elders kneel before Imu.
As the
Levely
was beginning, the Five Elders were approached by Shanks. Because of his position, they reluctantly allowed him to talk to them about a certain pirate.
After meeting with Shanks, the Elders headed toward the
Empty Throne
, and talked about how King
Nefertari Cobra
of
Arabasta
had requested to meet with them. Upon reaching the Empty Throne, they knelt before its occupant
Imu
as they requested that Imu tell them the name of the "light" that needed to be extinguished from history.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Peter and the other Elders are attacked and ambushed by Sabo.
Shortly following their meeting with Imu, the Elders granted Cobra the audience he requested at the Empty Throne. Cobra brought up his ancestor,
Nefertari Lili
who was one of the
First Twenty
founders of the
World Government
, and explained how she disappeared following her decision to abdicate living in Mary Geoise; he asked if the Elders had any records of what became of her. The Elders claimed to have no answer for this, and Cobra then asked about the meaning of the initial
D.
, revealing to the Elders' shock that a letter from Lili had been passed down through the Nefertari Family. Imu then entered the room and sat on the Empty Throne, and the Elders were shocked at Imu's decision to be revealed to Cobra.
Imu talked with Cobra about Lili and the D., and the Elders drew flintlocks as they intended to execute Cobra for seeing Imu. Imu was the first to strike Cobra, but then along with the Elders was attacked by
Sabo
using
Hiken
. Following the attack, the Elders and Imu transformed into beastly forms and pursued Sabo as he fled the room with Cobra. Following another strike by Imu, Cobra sacrificed himself to allow Sabo to flee and was promptly killed; the Elders then noticed that
Wapol
had been spying on the affairs in the room through a small peephole.
Following the Levely's conclusion, the Five Elders were in the Room of Authority discussing
Sabo
and the growing issues with
Vegapunk
on
Egghead
when they received a call from Imu, who wished to test out Vegapunk's
Mother Flame
invention; Nusjuro advised to test it on a forested area rather than in the sea. Imu told them to test it on the
Lulusia Kingdom
, and
Nusjuro
and Peter both noted how useful the weapon could be to quell a long conflict if they could one day use it freely. Imu also gave them the command to find and seize
Nefertari Vivi
.
They later discussed the
Raid on Onigashima
, namely the orders they had given to eliminate
Nico Robin
and prepare to have the Marines assume control of
Wano Country
in the aftermath of the battle. The Elders then discussed the potential of the
Gomu Gomu no Mi
, which was consumed by
Monkey D. Luffy
, actually being the renamed "Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika" and awakening; a course of action they did not wish to occur. Warcury dismissed the existence of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika as a legend, but Peter countered by asking why the World Government had bothered to change its name if it was, saying the objective was likely to erase the fruit from history.
The Five Elders commanded
Guernika
to interfere in the battle between Luffy and
Kaidou
to eliminate the former, and Guernika sacrificed himself to allow Kaidou to inflict a deadly blow on Luffy.
The Five Elders' attempt to eliminate Luffy proved a failure, as they later came to learn that the Gomu Gomu no Mi had indeed been awakened and Kaidou and Big Mom had both fallen in battle. Because Wano's borders were not opened as was initially expected, the Elders called off the Marine invasion but maintained the order for Robin to be captured.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
One Piece Film: Red
[
]
The Five Elders watched
Uta
's concert in
Elegia
from the
Den Den Mushi
. They discussed Uta being the daughter of Shanks, a serious threat that was opposed to the Great Pirate Era, and how to stop her rebellion, though there was some hesitation among them to carry out her elimination as they worried she may have been related to the
Figarland Family
. Also, they were very concerned about Uta's connection with
Tot Musica
and they could not afford to be cautious if she summoned that as a threat. The Five Elders did not fall asleep to Uta's powers as they already muted her songs. They were later informed by Lucci about an estimate being 70% of the world's population would be pulled into the
Uta World
.
The Five Elders, horrified, witnessed Uta turning everyone including
Saint Charlos
into inanimate objects. As they could not afford more casualties, they needed to make a decision even if a Celestial Dragon would get caught in the crossfire. They witnessed Tot Musica, finally summoned by Uta, attacking the Marine ships. Lucci tried to turn off the Den Den Mushi to cut the sounds, but Peter stated there was no point to mute it as the reality and the song of Tot Musica had already been linked. After Tot Musica was defeated by Luffy and Shanks, the Five Elders witnessed Uta releasing everyone from the Uta World through singing.
Concludes non-canon section.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
Having received their orders from Imu, the Elders then received a call from
Marine Headquarters
revealing they had traced Sabo to Lulusia, and the Elders took note of this stroke of fortune as the Lulusia Kingdom was completely annihilated by the Mother Flame soon afterward with Peter declaring it never existed in the first place.
The Five Elders also received a call from one of Vegapunk's satellites,
York
, who was aspiring to become a Celestial Dragon; Peter and the other Elders subsequently learned that Vegapunk was doing forbidden research on the Void Century and decided to send a squad of CP0-Agents to assassinate Vegapunk and all his satellites, including York.
Following Saturn departing to Egghead, the remaining elders in the Room of Authority were contacted by York a second time. While their conversation was overheard by Saturn and
Kizaru
, York asked them why they intended to kill her as well, with Mars replying she was still a Vegapunk after all. Upon the elders negotiating a deal with her, York revealed that she needed saving from Luffy before he kills her, much to Peter's shock.
After hearing Luffy declare that he will become the Pirate King over the Den Den Mushi and demanded that the Marine fleet retreat if they valued York's life,
Marcus Mars
tried to fish for information on the current situation of the Labophase. Luffy revealed that there were some injured on his side, but was interrupted by another voice and the call was cut before Luffy could divulge any more information. Peter commented that the other voice belonged to a woman, and wondered aloud if it belonged to Nico Robin.
Peter is decapitated by Dorry and Brogy.
As the
Egghead Incident
went on, the situation did not play into the World Government's favor. While Vegapunk had been successfully eliminated by Saturn and Kizaru, but his death triggered a global broadcast that would reveal much of the World Government's top secrets to the entire planet. Peter and the other Elders were unnerved by the very idea, and eventually contacted Saturn to summon them all to Egghead in order to stop the broadcast before it could be completed.
Saturn complied with their request, with Peter and his fellow Elders were able to successfully touch down on Egghead by means of Magic Circles. As Peter and the other Elders arrived, they transformed into their beast forms and stood in unison against Luffy, before going off on their separate tasks. Peter joined Saturn and Warcury in focusing on Luffy, with Peter utilizing his Devil Fruit ability to burrow into the ground to try and ambush Luffy by surprise. Moments later, he reemerged directly under Luffy and devoured the pirate whole; however, Peter was almost immediately decapitated by the newly arrived giants
Dorry
and
Brogy
, freeing Luffy in the process.
Peter is stopped by Luffy.
Despite the severe damage, Peter was able to regenerate a bit later alongside his other Elders.
After making a quick recovery, Peter realized that Luffy and his Giant allies were attempting to make an escape. He moved into action, using a suction ability to generate a vortex and preventing them from making any progress in escaping. In response, Luffy used his own abilities to break a building in half, followed by throwing it straight into Peter's mouth, leaving his ability effectively neutralized.
However, Peter later managed to get rid of the building and telepathically conversing with the Elders about Vegapunk's intention behind his broadcast and Mars being unable to stop the broadcast.
Peter inhaling the trapped Cipher Pol agents.
Sometime later, Nusjuro bisected the Labophase, resulting in all of the trapped Cipher Pol agents and Seraphim falling down to the Fabiriophase. As a result of Mars' previous order to exterminate all life on the island in order to stop Vegapunk's broadcast, Peter used his ability to suck up many Cipher Pol agents. Moments later, he and his fellow Elders would receive a transmission from York, stating her realization that the
Iron Giant
was protecting the Broadcast Den Den Mushi.
Upon hearing this theory, Peter abandoned his previous goals and reconvened with his fellow Elders(sans Nusjuro) around the Iron Giant. As the group got a clear look at the robot, they came to the realization that it was the very same machine that had attacked Mary Geoise 200 years prior. After hearing Vegapunk begin to make his announcement on the meaning of the letter "D.", Peter watched as Warcury quickly dispatched the Iron Giant, knocking it to the ground, and apparently stopping Vegapunk's broadcast.
Peter uses his ability to stop the Giant's ship from escaping.
Wishing to continue with their success, the Five Elders moved on to the next most pressing issue: killing off the remaining Vegapunks. After figuring out the locations from York, each of the Elders proceeded with their new task. Whilst Mars got a lead due to his flight ability, Peter and Warcury quickly made their way toward the coastline in order to target Atlas, the Giants, Bonney, and the Straw Hats.
After arriving at the coast, Peter ejected the debris and Cipher Pol agents that he had sucked up earlier, and instead began to attempt to suck up the Giant's ship, preventing it from leaving. In response to this, Luffy made his way back onto the island and fought with Peter, punching him in order to stop his attack.
Peter bites off the Iron Giant's arm.
Due to the reemergence of the Iron Giant from the ocean, Luffy retreated back to the Giant's ship, allowing the machine to confront the Elders instead. The Iron Giant attempted to use one of its weapons against Peter, but failed, due to its advanced age making them inoperable. In response, Peter used his abilities to bite the machine's arm off, although it remained operational. While this was happening, Peter received orders from Saturn to quickly destroy it entirely.
Peter and Warcury would comply, and continue to make attempts on its life while Saturn faced off against Luffy and Bonney.
Peter and the other Elders are forced out of their transformations.
Eventually, Warcury managed to ram the Iron Giant once more, causing critical damage. At the same time, Peter moved to attack the Giants and Straw Hats, tunneling out of the ground and attempting to land on their ships. Before this could happen, the Iron Giant, on its last legs, untied a knot somewhere on its body, releasing a massive burst of Haki that was sealed within it by
Joy Boy
. The Haki was potent enough to force Peter and the other Elders out of their transformations, before sending all but Saturn back to Mary Geoise.
While the remaining Elders waited for Saturn to return, they were instead surprised by
Figarland Garling
entering the Room of Authority, seemingly without their approval. While admonishing him for his lack of respect, they became shocked when he announced he was appointed as the new Warrior God of Science and Defense, replacing Saturn as one of the Five Elders as he took the seat that his predecessor once sat on.
