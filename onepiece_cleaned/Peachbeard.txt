Peachbeard
is the epithet of the captain of the
Peachbeard Pirates
, who are subordinates of the
Emperor
Blackbeard
.
Appearance
[
]
Peachbeard appears to be a slim man of roughly average height. His face is somewhat narrow, and his jaw is very long, ending in a pronounced chin. He has long flowing hair that reaches down to his chest in waves. As his given name implies, Peachbeard also sports a long handlebar pink mustache which curls upwards at the ends and a long goatee with a slight downward curl. He has some wrinkles around his eyes and mouth and a stitched scar running from his left eye to his left cheekbone.
His attire is reminiscent of that of a classic pirate: with a handkerchief and feather hat, a dark jacket hanging from his shoulders, and a simple shirt and trousers. In its belt, it takes writing: "Momo", that alludes to its nickname in Japanese: "Momohige".
Personality
[
]
Peachbeard is a very sadistic and violent man who has no problem with attacking and pillaging innocent villages, and while attacking the Lulusia Kingdom, he told his crew to kill any citizen who resisted. He sometimes feigns an understanding attitude, as he recognized that it was the fault of the Lulusia Kingdom royalty and the
Marines
that Lulusia Kingdom was left unprotected, but his only real care is for treasure, as he hit
a woman
after finding out what treasure the Lulusia Kingdom held.
Peachbeard is also very expressive and quick to shock and anger, as he vocally expressed his bewilderment at the presence of four
Revolutionary Army
commanders on Lulusia Kingdom as well as their personalities and abilities. He is also prone to mockery, as he laughed profusely when the townspeople picked up sticks to fight his crew.
Like many other people, he has a
distinct laugh
: "Momohahaha".
