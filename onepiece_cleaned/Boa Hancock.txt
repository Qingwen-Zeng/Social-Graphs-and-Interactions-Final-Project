Introduction
History
For the chapter of the same name, see
Chapter 516
.
"Pirate Empress" Boa Hancock
is the current
captain
of the
Kuja Pirates
and was the only female
Warlord of the Sea
before the organization's disbandment. She is the current
empress
of
Amazon Lily
,
also known as the
"Snake Princess"
. As the current empress she succeeds former empresses
Tritoma
,
Shakuyaku
, and
Gloriosa
. She rules over the
Kuja
tribe with her two younger sisters,
Boa Sandersonia
and
Boa Marigold
.
Kidnapped by the
World Nobles
as a child along with her sisters, she was enslaved and tortured for years; during this time she was force-fed the
Mero Mero no Mi
, which gives her the ability to turn both living and non-living things into stone. She and her sisters escaped from
Mary Geoise
during a mass breakout instigated by
Fisher Tiger
. She was returned to her home with the help of Gloriosa,
Silvers Rayleigh
and Shakuyaku, where she would eventually become the island's empress, as well as one of the Seven Warlords.
Though initially antagonistic towards
Monkey D. Luffy
, his selfless actions and animosity towards the Celestial Dragons caused her to befriend, and eventually fall in love, with him. She went on to serve as one of Luffy's most stalwart allies, helping him infiltrate
Impel Down
, siding with him in the
Summit War of Marineford
, providing him a
location
to train on for two years, and then helping him reunite with his crew and supporting him from afar.
While employed within the Seven Warlords, she turned against the World Government on a number of occasions to support Luffy, though she was able to retain her title by feigning innocence. However, the Warlords were officially abolished after the most recent
Levely
, causing her to lose her status and became one of the world's most wanted criminals.
Vegapunk
was able to
clone
Hancock as one of the
Seraphim
,
S-Snake
, to replace the Warlords.
She initially serves as the main antagonist of the
Amazon Lily Arc
, before becoming a major ally for the rest of the
Summit War Saga
, as well as the
Return to Sabaody Arc
. She also acts as an ally of Luffy during the
3D
2Y
special, the
Cidre Guild filler Arc
, and the movie
One Piece: Stampede
.
She first gained a
bounty
of
80,000,000 due to her being a captain of the Kuja Pirates before it was frozen after she joined the Seven Warlords.
However, after the abolition of the Seven Warlords, Hancock's bounty was reinstated and raised to
1,659,000,000.

Appearance
Hancock is considered the most beautiful person in the world. She has a more conventionally-proportioned figure compared to her abnormal and huge sisters. She is very tall and slender with long black hair that extends past her waist with locks of hair that frame her face down to her chin and shows off her high forehead, dark brown (dark blue in the anime) eyes with long, voluminous eyelashes and pale skin. She has a narrow waist and very large breasts, and a pair of large golden serpent earrings.
Her attire changes frequently. When first introduced, she wore a revealing red V-neck blouse that showed much of her chest and a loose sarong that exposed her long, slender legs with the green symbol of the Kuja adorned on it, along with a white cape sporting
epaulettes
more commonly found on the jackets of high-ranking
Marines
, and red high heel pumps. She then wore a qipao with a hooded cloak which she used to cover Luffy until they arrived at Impel Down and then took it off during the battle against
Whitebeard
.
During the
Summit War of Marineford
, she wore a purple dress with Kuja designs on it and purple high heel pumps. Upon her return to Amazon Lily, she reverted to her original outfit (with the exception of her cape). In all her outfits, she has worn a pair of golden earrings that resemble snakes and black high-heeled shoes; her attire is also adorned with the emblem of the Kuja, with the exception of when Hancock fell ill due to her
Love Sickness
, during which she wore a red blouse. After the timeskip, her attire looks the same as when she was first introduced, except it is colored blue (although it remains red in the anime).
Her extraordinary beauty is noted by many throughout the world: one of the
Risky Brothers
claims that her beauty is in second place to the
mermaids
,
especially
Shirahoshi
,
while others like
Marguerite
and
Hannyabal
claim she is the most beautiful woman in the world. She is also almost always seen with
Salome
, her large
Snake Weapon
, who wears a skull on her head and is usually seen smiling.
Even though Hancock normally looks either calmly beautiful or cute (in an attempt to "apologize" for her actions), she can look very intimidating and angered with her eyes bulging madly and her teeth bared, as seen when
Smoker
attacked
Luffy
at Marineford.
Before Hancock fell in love with Luffy and when she is not around Luffy, her eyes tend to look emotionless, but when she is around Luffy, her eyes show much more emotion, making her look like a girl in love.
Along with her sisters, on her back is the slave mark of the
Celestial Dragon
, something that she was so intent on keeping secret and was willing to petrify anyone (other than her sisters and Elder
Nyon
) who saw it. In order to make sure it was never seen, she and her sisters concocted a lie that what was really on the sisters' backs were pairs of Gorgon eyes which would petrify anyone who sets eyes on them. Hancock uses this "curse" as an excuse for her and her sisters'
Devil Fruit
abilities.
As a young child, she looked quite similar to how she does now, but the only difference is that only her side-locks went past her shoulders and were worn in beads. During her escape from
Mary Geoise
, she wore rags and her hair was tied in pigtails.
In
SBS Volume 63
, Oda drew the Seven Warlords as children. Hancock is shown wearing a small, laced top with exotic swirl patterns leaving her mid-riff exposed. Her only other piece of clothing is a small loin cloth around her hips.
In the
3D
2Y
special, she wears a purple dress with gold trim as well as black heels, and a great light purple image of her Jolly Roger at the bottom. During the
Cidre Guild Arc
and
One Piece: Stampede
, she wears a V-neck black dress with one of the sleeves and a half chest area in white and with images of her Jolly Roger on the part of the skirt, in addition to a purple sash at the waist, and a black cape with a pink interior and with golden shoulder pads, along with black heels.
Body Measurements
The author has also answered to a fan's question asking about Hancock's
body measurements
are as follows:
Updated measurements were provided in
SBS Volume 58
, in which
Eiichiro Oda
responded to a fan question by saying that her height is 191 cm (6'3"), and according to
Sanji
, her three measurements are B111-W61-H91 (43.7"-24.02"-35.83"), making her breasts a J-cup in Japan. Before the timeskip, they appeared to be much larger than
Robin
or
Nami
's breasts, but after the timeskip, this was no longer the case.

Personality
Hancock is a very complex woman. At first glance, she appears to be selfish, pompous, spoiled, and used to having her own way. She can also act arrogant and cruel, usually justifying her less-than-admirable actions with her unmatched beauty, causing her to think that she can get away with anything because the world will forgive her (and save for the handful able to resist she is largely successful in this approach, as gleeful suitors of both genders happily forgive her every transgression).
She also made it seem that she did not think much of the Kuja tribe either as she commented to Elder
Nyon
that she did not care if the island was destroyed or not, since everyone would forgive her anyway because she is beautiful.
Hancock collapsing from being insulted.
Because of her beauty and strength, she is used to seeing men and women, young and old alike, fall instantly in love with her. As a result of this, people forgive her when she acts cutely apologetic or reminds them of her beauty. However, when Luffy came along and displayed a complete immunity to her charms, she initially felt that she could not bear the existence of someone completely invulnerable to her powers and would collapse dramatically whenever insulted.
This feeling has eroded away, though, as she deeply loves Luffy in spite of his immunity to her. Even after the two-year timeskip, Hancock continues to be in love with Luffy as much as before despite that the latter openly rejected a wedding proposal from her.
Even though Luffy repeatedly turns down her marriage proposals, Hancock is not discouraged by this and with every rejection she seemingly becomes more determined to marry him.
Pride and Beauty
Because of her reputation as the most beautiful woman in the world, Hancock takes pride in both her looks and reputation, flaunting her looks whenever present. She is more than using her looks to force others to do her bidding, be it her enemies or her subjects no matter how she behaves knowing how hopelessly they would fall for her with her charms. She completely justifies all of her actions, no matter how cruel or absurd they are that she will always be forgiven because she is beautiful, which, ironically, has been proven true as up until the abolishment of the Warlord System and was never punished for most of her actions throughout the war at Marineford.
Her pride also extends to the reputation and dignity of her Kuja legacy. Because of her past as a slave and being Empress of Amazon Lily, Hancock goes to great lengths to hide her shameful past to her people out of fear of being shunned and forever shaming her people and the Kuja reputation. She takes great effort in ensuring no one sees her or her sisters slave marks on their backs by lying about a "Gorgon Curse" and no one spying on her during a bath out of fear of the truth coming out. Even when she first met Luffy, who accidently saw her back, she refused to let him live. She even would prefer to die than let anyone learn of her past as a slave.
Like her fellow Kuja, Hancock has no modesty at all, being unashamed showing herself naked to Luffy upon revealing her past. However, she makes it very serious that she would rather die than ever let anyone see her slave mark on her back, fearing she would only bring shame to her people if they ever learned that their empress was a slave of the World Nobles.
Traumatic Behavior
Hancock crying while remembering her painful past.
It was revealed the reason for Hancock's lies and attitude towards life was that because of her horrible past, she did not want to ever show weakness again to anyone. She harbored a great fear of getting close to anyone, other than her own sisters, and would even go as far to deceive all of the other Kuja.
This caused her surrogate mother, Elder
Nyon
, to fear that Hancock had truly turned as cold as ice. It was not until Hancock confessed everything to
Luffy
that she finally showed emotion, breaking down in tears after reliving her painful memories.
Deep down, Hancock is a rather sensitive and vulnerable woman who is afraid and concerned about how other people (especially the other
Kuja
) might react to the truth of the shameful past that she and her sisters share. She is also much softer and more compassionate towards others when she opens up. That part of her was only first shown for the first time in several years in front of Monkey D. Luffy and she has not only befriended, but also fallen deeply in love with him, even agreeing to venture to the land of her suffering, from her days of a slave, at his request for his
brother
.
Because of her enslavement, Hancock has shown a strong defiance towards any form of capture out of fear of being enslaved again. When the Marines invaded Amazon Lily and Koby tried to offer a peaceful solution at the request she turn herself in alone, she refused to be imprisoned ever again. Even when Blackbeard was choking the life out of her, she still refused to submit to his demands, preferring death over capture. Even after the ordeal was over thanks to Rayleigh's arrival, Hancock's pride took a heavy blow from her feelings of weakness over her defeat at the hands of Blackbeard and having to rely on Rayleigh, an outsider, to protect her people and save her life as well. She was also left quite vulnerable after the ordeal, going as far as to rest her head on Rayleigh's leg trying to figure out her next move.
Love For Luffy
Hancock's love for Luffy.
Her newfound love and loyalty for Luffy has managed to help melt the ice in Hancock's heart and regain the original kindness she had long since buried away. Unlike with her people or her enemies, Hancock acts much kinder and warmer around Luffy, acting like a teenage girl with a crush. Whenever he is in her presence, she is quick to turn shy, barely able to meet him in the eye and gleaming over every action he takes. Even when he is not nearby, merely thinking of him causes her to blush and truly smile in a way that the other Kuja have said is unusual of her. Amazingly, Hancock is also obeying every of Luffy's orders. According to
Ran
, Hancock also collapsed from having too much heart-fluttering due to her love for Luffy. After she was hugged by Luffy for the key to Ace's
Seastone
cuffs, Hancock's love for the Straw Hat Pirates' Captain has increased even further as she desires to become Luffy's wife.
While normally calm and level-headed, when angered, Hancock can be highly violent towards those who have wronged her. After falling in love with Luffy, she becomes enraged at the thought of anyone harming him. Seeing Smoker nearly kill him, she flew into rage violently kicking him away screaming she had never been this mad in all her life. She also destroyed several Pacifistas in rage for "ruining" her moment when she was thinking about Luffy.
Since Nyon cleared up the misunderstanding about marriage in general, Hancock is very determined to marry Luffy someday no matter what. Even though he turned her proposal down, she still loves him and is not deterred at all.
Hancock's love for Luffy is so strong it passed down to her
Seraph
,
S-Snake
, who acts the same way as Hancock around Luffy. This surprised Dr. Vegapunk, since he did not program her to act like this.
Compassion
Despite the conceit she shows to her enemies and the façade she puts on for her people, she does show genuine care for people close to her. This was seen when she flew into a fit of rage and kicked
Smoker
away from Luffy after he had tried to kill him. Ignoring the possible consequences of her actions, she openly and publicly declared Luffy to be her beloved, effectively choosing her love over her title (and her people's treaty). During her fury, she showed none of her usual calm arrogance. This is seen again, to a lesser extent, when she screams at
Aokiji
for stabbing Luffy with an
Ice Saber
. Her anger is enough to make even
Jinbe
to cower in fear, albeit slightly and in a comedic manner.
She also is very loving and kind towards her younger sisters Sonia and Mary because of the bond they share as sisters ever since they were enslaved by the World Nobles. Even after the two were defeated by Luffy, unlike she did with
Marguerite
and the others, Hancock showed no ill toward their loss and was gladder they were safe than anything else. She also shows a great deal of affection toward her pet snake Salome.
In spite of her cruel behavior towards her fellow Kuja's deep down, Hancock does truly care for them, having joined the Warlords to protect them from outside forces. She even admits to Luffy she constantly lies to them out of shame fearing that she would forever tarnish the reputation of the Kuja's if they learned that their empress was a slave.
Authoritativeness
Because of how easy it is for her to manipulate others with her beauty, Hancock can be very selfish, used to having her own way despite being Empress and quite unreasonable towards others, men especially. When Luffy was captured and despite his honest attempts to explain why he was on Amazon Lily, Hancock ignored his requests claiming he was lying to defend himself. However, Hancock is capable of being reasonable to an extent. After her sisters were defeated by Luffy and he again tried to plead with her to unpetrify her subjects, Hancock agreed but only if Luffy chose one of two options: she can unpetrify them on the condition he has to find another way off the island or he can leave the island and they stay that way. She was shocked to see him unhesitantly picking the latter and, after further testing his character, Hancock agreed to help him get off the island regardless. After falling in love with Luffy, Hancock gradually mellows out as a person and as a proper ruler.
Hancock is also fearless and strong-willed, being completely unafraid of the consequences of her actions because of her beauty and strength. Even as the Marines surrounded her island and her people panicked, Hancock remained confident with a smile reminding everyone she was a Warlord for a reason. She was completely unfazed when Blackbeard was strangling her, as she absolutely refused to give him even a hint of fear or submissiveness.
Hatred of Men
Due to her suffering as a slave and how the first man she ever saw painfully burned her back with her slave mark, Hancock is very discriminating and judgmental towards men. She refused to listen to Luffy's story about how he was sent to her island or give him any mercy even after Marguerite pleaded on his behalf. When she gave him the option to leave the island or help unpetrify Marguerite and her friends, Hancock believed he would act selfish to save himself and was speechless when he showed his selfless nature. After falling in love with Luffy, Hancock seems to have lessened her judgmental nature towards men as she allowed Law and his crew to dock at the edge of her island and chose to lift her country's law to some extent and permitted Jinbe to wander on the island without watch.
This especially qualifies towards anyone affiliated with the government. As due to how the Marines turn a blind eye towards slavery in general despite it being abolished years ago, Hancock unhesitatingly petrified both pirates and Marines during the Marineford War citing to her all men, barring Luffy, are all alike. She also spared no mercy to the Marines and
Blackbeard Pirates
that invaded her island.
Because of the horrors she endured from the World Nobles, Hancock became a very bitter and cold woman, caring nothing for others (except her sisters) and usually maintains a tough and aloof demeanor. She maintains this attitude due to her belief she should be strong for her people and out of fear of being taking advantage of again. After falling in love with Luffy, she has become a lot more sympathetic and kinder. She now smiles more often and has started to treat her fellow Kuja's with much more kindness and respect and has even decided to do work with them.
Running Gags
While referring to herself, Hancock uses "warawa"
(
ワラワ
?
)
—an antiquated pronoun that signifies nobility—instead of the more common "watashi"
(
私
?
)
.
Hancock "looking down" on a group of
Marines
.
In spite of her arrogant behavior, Hancock has several running gags. The first is that when she looks down on people, she leans backwards so she faces the ceiling (or the sky) above her while pointing a finger, apparently looking down on people so much she is looking up.
Another is that she appears to dislike small animals, in which she angrily asks who left the animal in front of where she is walking before kicking it away, no matter how cute it is. A Kuja responsibly apologizes, while the offended animal snarls at her, and Hancock advises her to be more careful in the future.
She also tends to lose her temper whenever someone tries to keep her from spending time with Luffy, such as when she glared angrily at Jinbe for trying to eat some of the food she made for Luffy and when Rayleigh forbid her from seeing Luffy during his training, which prompted her to angrily pinch his nose.
Lastly, she often thinks about Luffy and mistakenly thinks that they are married or engaged and despite (or perhaps because of) repeatedly being told that they are not.
Relationships
Family
Boa Marigold and Boa Sandersonia
Further information:
Gorgon Sisters
The three Gorgon sisters.
Hancock is very close to her sisters because they went through a lot together as slaves. The three of them have a strong bond and support each other's actions. Such was the case that when she became Empress, she allowed her sisters to rule alongside her, and entrusts them with her authority over Amazon Lily when she leaves for
Impel Down
. Initially, when Luffy requested for Hancock to travel to Impel Down,
Marigold
and
Sandersonia
vehemently disagreed with the idea. However, when Hancock accepted his request, they respected her wishes, as well as her love for Luffy, and wished the best of luck for them. Given the way children are born on their island, in that women who have traveled abroad return pregnant, it is unknown if the three share the same father or are even blood related due to their different appearances, but it is assumed they share the same mother.
Hancock frequently refers to her sisters with nicknames: "Sonia" for Sandersonia and "Mari" for Marigold.
Gloriosa
Hancock takes the role as a spoiled brat to
Gloriosa
, even though Gloriosa helped her, and her sisters get back to
Amazon Lily
. Gloriosa tried to convince Hancock to accept the summons, but she refused. Hancock likes to make sure that Gloriosa remembers that she is considered a traitor to the Kuja and told her to stop bossing her around since Hancock is the current Empress of Amazon Lily. She then threw Gloriosa out of the window, despite the fact that had Gloriosa not been at sea at the time, she and her sisters would have nowhere to go, and Gloriosa treated them as though they were her own daughters. Despite their previous interactions, Gloriosa still deeply cares for Hancock as though she was her daughter. In a similar vein, Hancock values Gloriosa's experience and sagacious insights. She especially appreciates Gloriosa's romantic advice and support for her relationship with Luffy.
She is aware that had Gloriosa not been at sea at the time, she and her sisters would have nowhere to go and probably be subjected to more suffering. Gloriosa treats the three sisters as though they were her own daughters. In many of their interactions, the relationship between the two is akin to a teenage daughter and a mother, further amplified by their differences and age. Regardless, Hancock does have a degree of respect for Gloriosa as she went to seek her wisdom so as to understand her sudden and first ever feeling of love, which Hancock later thanked her for. In return, Gloriosa actively supports and is proud of Hancock's decision in helping the object of her love, instead of allowing it to consume and kill her. She is glad to see a momentous and positive change in the Empress, understanding that she is pivotal to the prosperity of their people. She does, however, become annoyed by Hancock's obsession with Luffy and the misunderstandings and displays to which the obsession leads.
Salome
Salome
is Hancock's personal snake weapon. Salome is typically used as a throne for her to sit on and as a weapon for battle. No matter where Hancock is, Salome is next to her. Hancock seems to be close to Salome as the snake was worried when Hancock was ill because of her love sickness and assists Hancock in any of her battles. Salome has been seen assisting Hancock in many of her heated battles with strong adversaries. Her orders are absolute, and she would willingly follow any of her master's commands.
Kuja Tribe
Hancock has a complex relationship with her
Kuja
subjects, protecting them from the World Government, but refusing to continue protecting them by working with the latter. She also destroyed a clay statue of her, made by several little girls, simply because it was made from dirt, mud and clay, and petrified three Kuja warriors (
Marguerite
,
Sweet Pea
, and
Aphelandra
) for allowing a man (
Monkey D. Luffy
) to enter the island and defending his crime. However, there has been no Kuja who does not love and admire Hancock and agrees with every decision she makes (apart from Elder
Nyon
and possibly Shakky to an extent).
Even Marguerite showed no hard feelings towards Hancock after she was unpetrified. Hancock likewise actually cares what they would think of her if they knew she was once a slave, even though she is now an Empress, and fears she will bring shame onto the tribe if they were aware of her past. So, she has continuously lied to them to protect herself and her sisters. She even referred to them as her brethren, as opposed to her subjects.
Ever since Hancock fell in love with Luffy, she began to outwardly treat the Kuja warriors kindly. She sometimes goes as far as offering to personally help them prepare food for Luffy's recovery. On their end, the entire tribe is fiercely loyal to her and looks to her for guidance in times of need, supporting her every decision, including her love life.
After the most recent attack from the Marines and the Blackbeard Pirates, Hancock decides to leave her home to protect her people from further attacks knowing she is the primary target and in order to reunite with Luffy.
Friends
Silvers Rayleigh
Silvers Rayleigh
became very good friends with Hancock and her sisters. He is one of the two exceptions from Hancock's hatred towards men for helping her and her sisters after they escaped from the World Nobles, the other one is
Monkey D. Luffy
(Hancock's love interest and the only man who actually punched a
Celestial Dragon
). When Rayleigh told Hancock that no women are allowed during Luffy's training, Hancock scolded him by pinching his nose, but she conceded after he told her it was all for Luffy's benefit.
After her status as a Warlord was stripped, Rayleigh immediately rushed to Amazon Lily to assist Hancock in protecting her island and intimidated Blackbeard into leaving. He apologized to her for being late and frankly told Blackbeard that he despised him greatly for what he did to her and the island. After the ordeal, Rayleigh comforted Hancock, lending his knee to her.
Monkey D. Luffy
Originally antagonistic towards him, Hancock saw
Luffy
as a man who, being immune to her charms despite seeing her naked, could not be allowed to exist. She refused to believe his story of being
sent
to the island by
Bartholomew Kuma
and ordered his execution. She also thought he was just like all men in the world, selfish and arrogant, but was proven wrong and was even moved by his acts of selflessness. Luffy is actually possibly the only one (beside Rayleigh and Shakky) outside her family that she truly considers a friend and someone she can trust.
She quickly befriended him when he covered the back of her sister when he was fighting so nobody could see the Celestial Dragon's slave mark on her, chose to save Marguerite, Sweet Pea, and Aphelandra rather than benefit himself, and learning he went as far as to strike one of the
World Nobles
, as well as harbor no hatred for Hancock for being a slave in the past, causing Hancock to deem Luffy as too trustworthy. As such, due to Luffy's bravery, selflessness and kind heart, Hancock pledged her strong loyalty towards Luffy and has fallen in love with him, causing her to have "
Love Sickness
", which was the cause of death of nearly all of the previous Empresses. However, Elder Nyon says that all of the previous Empresses died because they tried to suppress their feelings by distancing themselves from their object of desire, whereas Hancock would survive by going with Luffy to
Impel Down
so he could rescue his
brother
.
Due to her feelings, Hancock has a hard time looking Luffy in the eye and tends to blush in his presence (much like a young girl with a crush). She is also prone to daydreams involving Luffy. Hancock is willing to obey Luffy's orders and can never deny them. She requested that Luffy call her Hancock, as opposed to her title, and nearly fainted the first time he called her by her given name correctly, given the fact that he had said it wrong a few times before, calling her "Hammock". Moments later, she actually did faint after believing that Luffy said "I love you"
(
愛してる。
,
aishiteru
?
)
when he actually said "Thank you"
(
ありがとう
,
arigatou
?
)
. She continues to faint in joy whenever Luffy says her name right and apparently is keeping count of how many times he has said her name correctly. Her love for Luffy also caused Hancock to collapse from too much heart flattering. When Luffy hugged her during the
Summit War of Marineford
, she thought of it as a proposal of marriage. Later though,
Nyon
told her that she was not married. As a result, Hancock is now set on the idea of marrying Luffy. Even though Luffy says that he is not going to marry Hancock, she still loves him very much and is not deterred in the slightest by this.
During the
Summit War of Marineford
, Hancock states that all men, both Marine and pirate alike, are her enemies, Luffy standing as the lone exception.
Even after finding out the truth about Luffy's
heritage
, she cast it aside and did not care even if he is the son of the devil.
She is also extremely protective of Luffy, going so far as to attack Commodore
Smoker
for restraining Luffy, much to the shock of the Marines watching them. She even openly declared Luffy as her beloved.
In fact, ever since Luffy's arrival at Marineford, all Hancock could do was focus her attention on Luffy's well-being, bursting out in anger whenever he was attacked and shivering in fear whenever she could not tell if he was all right. Upon reaching Luffy after the war and receiving information about his critical condition from
Trafalgar Law
, Hancock expressed her desire to be the one to have taken all the suffering in Luffy's place. She cares so much for Luffy that she barely ate any food on her return to Amazon Lily until she was sure that Luffy was all right, and even then, commanded that as much food as possible be given to him so that he may recover.
After Luffy's 2-year training period, Hancock helped him reunite with his crew and, although saddened by his departure, she wished him the best of luck while not saying goodbye. Luffy stated he did not want to because he wants to see her again, much to her joy. Since then, Hancock regularly keeps tabs on Luffy's actions in the New World, such as hanging an enlarged version of his bounty poster on her castle after his exploits in Dressrosa. It is unknown if she is aware of Luffy's rise as a new member of the Four Emperors, though she still desires to reunite with him for her safety after the recent attack on her home island by both the Marines and Blackbeard Pirates.
Luffy hugs Hancock in gratitude.
While Luffy does not have the same romantic feelings towards Hancock that she feels towards him, he has shown that he genuinely cares for and appreciates her, viewing her as a close friend and trusted ally as well her loyalty towards him isn't misplaced. After realizing her tragic past as a slave of the World Nobles, Luffy immediately forgave Hancock for her actions and decided to keep her secret between them by never telling any of the Kuja. During his fight with Magellan, when the warden stated that he would have Luffy tell him how he managed to break into
Impel Down
, Luffy protected Hancock by declaring he would not tell Magellan even if it killed him. He later showed his gratitude by hugging her and remarking afterward that she had saved him twice, both in helping him break into Impel Down and giving him the key to Ace's
Seastone
handcuffs. Luffy also takes Hancock's advice seriously and did try his best to avoid causing trouble at Impel Down and
Sabaody Archipelago
because she told him not to, only failing because other were causing trouble and ended up dragging him into them.
Hancock loves Luffy so much that her love was passed on to her Seraphim, S-Snake, who acts the same way Hancock acts around Luffy; blushing around him, not being able to look directly into his eyes and complete inability to deny any of their requests. Jinbe himself pointing out that this made her the perfect copy of Hancock, as she despises everyone, with the only exception being Luffy. This surprised even Dr. Vegapunk himself, as he did not program her to act like that.
Shakuyaku
The former empress
Shakuyaku
is one of Hancock's predecessors from 2 generation ago. Shakky provided shelter for the three sisters after they escaped from the Celestial Dragon at
Mary Geoise
and helped of sending them back to Amazon Lily. She has strong respect for Shakky unlike Gloriosa who at times becomes overly 'naggy' and oppressive.
After Hancock lost her status as a Warlord, Shakky and
Rayleigh
returned to Amazon Lily, and Shakky warned Hancock that the Calm Belt was no longer safe due to the Marines'
technological advancements
.
Enemies
World Government and Marines
Even when she was one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, Hancock considered the
World Government
to be her enemy and, much like
Nico Robin
, she has stated that she hates the World Government and those in their complete obedience. Much of this comes from her past with the
Celestial Dragons
, who tortured her and her sisters from a young age, until they were rescued by
Fisher Tiger
. Even though she became a Warlord to protect her people, she will never take any orders from the World Government, despite claiming agreement with carrying them out, evidenced as when she lied about her agreement to wage war with
Whitebeard
simply to get them off her back temporarily. She also never keeps up to date with any information regarding them, such as when Bartholomew Kuma became a new member, she brushed it off since she views such news as unimportant unless it concerns her or her people.
In some cases, her friction with the World Government has reached dangerous levels, which even Elder
Nyon
criticizes. True enough, she has cause severe frictions with the government. She accepted to fight Whitebeard only because this allowed Monkey D. Luffy to rescue the important prisoner Portgas D. Ace (yet unknown to the World Government), and due to her actions bringing Luffy to Impel Down, she is indirectly responsible for the mass breakout of several prisoners before the war. She defended Luffy in front of several Marines and Smoker while proclaiming Luffy as her beloved and destroyed several Pacifistas to assist in Luffy and Jinbe's escape. She later held of Marines to assist the Straw Hats escape to
Fish-Man Island
.
Despite being "allied" with the
Marines
, she will never consider them as her allies and did not think twice about attacking them and other pirates during the
Summit War of Marineford
. Her continuous support of Luffy during the war put further strain on her status as a Warlord. As for the Marines, Hancock considers
Smoker
a personal enemy after he pinned down and attempted to kill Luffy. She swore to rip him to shreds and feed him to beasts.
She also grew angry at
Aokiji
when he stabbed Luffy with an
icicle blade
.
With the Seven Warlords system abolished due to
Crocodile
and
Donquixote Doflamingo
's sins, she is now considered as an enemy and a most wanted criminal to the government once again.
When a host of Marines attempted to arrest her, she was unafraid, prepared to show them the might of the Kuja, and refused to surrender herself and relegate as a prisoner to the World Government again (due to her being a former slave of the Celestial Dragons). However, even though the Marines and the
Blackbeard Pirates
were driven off, the growing threat that the Marines and their
Seraphim
posed to the island forced Hancock to contemplate leaving her home island entirely, acknowledging the Marines are only after her persistently.
Men
Seeing every man (except Luffy) as an enemy, Hancock indiscriminately attacks both marines and pirates during the war.
Due to her hellish experience with the first man she ever saw, the one who painfully burned the Hoof of the Soaring Dragon onto her back, Hancock has a bitter hatred towards all men (the only exceptions being Luffy, her love interest, and Rayleigh, who helped her and her sisters after they escaped from slavery) that caused her to indiscriminately attack pirates and Marine soldiers alike during the war.
That being said, she's not incapable of being reasonable towards men. What she thinks of Ace is unknown, as he is Luffy's brother (though she was surprised to find out they were not blood-related.
She did not show much antagonism towards him during their meeting, and she stole the key to his shackles during the war. She also made exceptions for the
Heart Pirates
and
Jinbe
, even allowing them to set up a small temporary camp on
Amazon Lily
.
World Nobles
Hancock and her sisters were once enslaved by the World Nobles. For four years, she suffered greatly and wished for nothing but death every day. Even after being freed, Hancock became a cruel and cold woman until she met Luffy, harboring a great deal of distrust towards everyone around her except her sisters. Despite being freed by Fisher Tiger, Hancock still maintains a large degree of trauma from them, having become severely warped from her days as a slave, shivering and crying from telling Luffy her tragic past. She was even left speechless after learning Luffy assaulted one, being amazed that there was someone foolish and brave enough to do so without regarding his own personal safety similar to Fisher Tiger. Even still, Hancock's behavior was severely warped by the torture she endured until she met Luffy and puts up a great deal of effort to ensure no one will know of her past.
Marshall D. Teach
Due to him being Luffy's arch-nemesis who is responsible for the Summit War at Marineford and the cause of his brother Ace's death,
Blackbeard
is a mortal enemy of Hancock. He came to Amazon Lily looking for Hancock to kill her and steal her
Mero Mero no Mi
. Although she was able to incapacitate his crew members, she was defeated when he used his powers on her. Upon defeating her, he choked her by the neck while Hancock furiously told him to get his filthy hands off of her, showing her immense hatred and disdain for him. She warned him that even if he kills her in order to take her powers, the ones she petrified will not be undone by anyone else who inherits her powers, but Blackbeard was uncaring about his crew members' fate. While Koby tried to reason about the lives of his crew and the Marines, Hancock was willing to undo the petrification so long as they all leave her island. Blackbeard however asserts how there is no guarantee that he could incapacitate her again and that if he was not using his Yami Yami No Mi on her, they would all be easily turned to stone and be killed by her. He was about to kill her until
Rayleigh
arrived, causing Blackbeard to spare Hancock's life and retreat.
Other
Fisher Tiger
Fisher Tiger
freed Hancock and her sisters, along with many other slaves, when he attacked the World Nobles at
Mary Geoise
. For this reason, he is one of the very few exceptions to Hancock's hatred of men. Though she was amazed and terrified by the recklessness and brutality of his rampage, she remains immeasurably grateful and respectful of him to the present day.
Portgas D. Ace
Portgas D. Ace
was Luffy's brother who she agreed to help rescue out of respect for her newfound love for Luffy. She showed no real antagonism upon first meeting him, while Ace questioned why she would want to meet him. Upon secretly informing him that she snuck his brother in to help rescue him he was shocked by his younger brother's recklessness. Ace also knew immediately she was telling the truth, due to knowing Luffy better than anyone and this is something he would do.
She was later shocked upon learning he was
Gol D. Roger
's son and that he and Luffy were not blood related.
Despite this, she still went out of her way to assist him and Luffy in secret by giving Luffy the key to his handcuffs. It is unknown how she felt over his death, but she ensured his sacrifice would not be in vain and protected his brother on her home island from the Marines going after him.
Straw Hat Pirates
It is unknown how Hancock feels towards the
Straw Hat Pirates
, as Luffy is the captain of the crew. She seems to care about them (due to her love for Luffy), as she willingly protected them from the Marines and helped them set sail to Fish-Man Island. The Straw Hats seems to appreciate what she did for them, as
Brook
and
Sanji
have already fallen for the Pirate Empress's beauty (with Sanji turning to stone just looking at her) and Sanji becoming extremely jealous upon learning how close Luffy is with her.
Usopp
also referred to her as the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She is highly regarded among the crew, with Nami being shocked at Luffy's friendship with her.
In the anime, when Luffy told Hancock about his crew, she became incredibly jealous of
Nami
and
Robin
, thinking they were love rivals. She also became determined not to lose against them, despite neither of them never having shown any romantic interest in Luffy.
Jinbe
Hancock has shown to be very distrusting towards
Jinbe
when they first met,
but because he helped save Luffy, she let him seek refuge on her island until he was fully healed. In fact, Hancock has grown to respect Jinbe for protecting Luffy and even allowed him to explore her island to watch over a wounded Luffy, making Jinbe the second man to have ever been allowed in her country, showing Hancock has come to trust Jinbe greatly. Jinbe has shown to have a fear of crossing her when he wanted to have some of Luffy's food (that she prepared for Luffy only) and despite their unstable relationship, they are allies against the World Government. Regardless, the two respect each other, and she saw him off as he left for his home. They also share a connected past of slavery, in which Jinbe's captain liberated a number of slaves, including Hancock and her sisters. It is unknown if she is aware that Jinbe has joined Luffy's crew or that he was Tiger's sworn brother.
In Egghead, Jinbe considered
S-Snake
to be nicer than the original Hancock. When S-Snake undo her spell due to her having Hancock's love for Luffy, Jinbe shown praised for the Seraphim being like the real Hancock when she always look down on everyone except for Luffy due to Hancock's love for him.
Trafalgar D. Water Law
Because of
Law
's willingness to help Luffy during his time of need, Hancock put much of her faith in him and thanked him for saving Luffy, making Law one of the few men she has come to respect aside from Luffy, Rayleigh, and Jinbe. She provided Law and his crew with food and shelter on her island under the terms they did not enter her city. Law also has shown to be among the few men who have had no interest in her beauty. To ensure Luffy's safety, she did not tell the Marines anything of their private meeting.
Abilities and Powers
Hancock is widely considered to be extremely powerful by friend and foe alike. Ruling beside her sisters, Hancock has power over
Amazon Lily
and the rest of the
Kuja
tribe. As the empress and captain of the tribe, Hancock is the strongest Kuja warrior. The Kuja believe that "strength is beauty", and since all members of the tribe state that she is the most beautiful in the world, they believe she is immensely powerful, and the strongest among the entire tribe. It is to be noted that only the strongest Kuja warriors are allowed in the country's pirate crew, Hancock and her sisters were strong enough to be there when they were small children, although it is possible, they were just
apprentices
like
Shanks
and
Buggy
.
Her strength is so great that it has even been acknowledged by the
Fleet Admiral
of the time,
Sengoku
of the
Marines
.
Gloriosa believed that there was little chance for Hancock to die in the Marineford War because of her great strength. Even former
Admiral
Kuzan
commented on her skills, stating she is not to be underestimated. Further testament to her strength is how she was one of the three Warlords who managed to leave the war without sustaining any injuries. The fact that she can earn a
80,000,000
bounty
after her first campaign as a pirate further supports her capabilities.
Over a decade later, her bounty became
1,659,000,000 following the disbandment of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
.
This also speaks to her strength considering unlike the other Warlords, she has not been involved with big name events recently.
Crocodile
,
Buggy
and
Mihawk
are a part of
Cross Guild
which they put bounties on marines' heads.
Blackbeard
and his crew goes around and steal
Devil Fruit's
.
Law
and
Jinbe
were a part of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
which took down the
Beasts Pirates
,
Perospero
and
Big Mom
.
Hancock easily breaks a Pacifista.
During the Marineford War, she had managed to take down several Pacifistas single handedly without much effort, where it took the whole
Straw Hat Pirates
(before their two-year training) to take down just one, which left them greatly worn out. During the Marines and the
Blackbeard Pirates
invasion of Amazon Lily to capture her, Hancock was able to easily defeat most of both invading parties by petrifying them, including
Vice Admiral
Yamakaji
and two of Blackbeard's Ten Titanic Captains,
Catarina Devon
and
Vasco Shot
, whom were among the strongest and most dangerous ex-prisoners in Impel Down Level 6. While
Blackbeard
was able to defeat Hancock thanks to his
ability to nullified
other Devil Fruit user abilities, he acknowledged she was worthy of being called the Pirate Empress. He further notes he would be in danger of getting petrified by her if he released her and decide killing her was the safer option, despite knowing he would not be able to return his crewmates to normal if he did. The fact that Blackbeard, an
Emperor of the Sea
with a bad habit of underestimating his opponents, chose not to fight Hancock directly and refuse to let his guard down around her only reinforces how dangerous Hancock is.
Hancock possessed a very powerful willpower when she is unaffected by Luffy's and Rayleigh's
Supreme King Haki
. Like Luffy, her willpower is so strong that Hancock refused to submit herself to the likes of her enemies when she refused to Koby's demand of becoming a prisoner to the World Government again (due to her being a former slave of the Celestial Dragons). Even when Blackbeard was initially choking the life out of her, she also refused to give into his demands and remanded defiant towards him.
Intelligence
Hancock has shown to be very sly and crafty when the situation demands it. This was particularly evident when she aided Monkey D. Luffy into discreetly breaking through Impel Down's outer defenses, as well as manipulating the great prison warden,
Magellan
, to her whims before relaying a secret message to Luffy's brother Ace, whom Luffy was trying to rescue. She has also proven to be a very skilled liar who is excellent at fabricating stories, and her confidence leads her to never consider the consequences of her actions. An example of this is when she takes advantage of her beauty in Impel Down floor 6 to drive the prisoners mad, making them disrespect Magellan and causing enough trouble to speak to Ace freely without anyone noticing. Despite this, Hancock can be somewhat ignorant as she frequently mistakes many of Luffy's actions as romantic.
She was able to easily feign a confident demeanor without any hints of trepidation when Vice Admiral
Momonga
suspected that she was hiding something underneath her cloak. This façade duped him into believing that she was innocent after she gave him permission to search her which he rejected. After being hounded by derogatory and lecherous comments by men and women alike for years, she was unperturbed by the rudeness of the worst criminals of level 6 Impel Down as she delivered her message to Ace. Luffy is the only one whom has continuously shattered her previously thought impervious façade.
Physical Abilities
Hancock fights hand-to-hand, turning her victims to stone in the process.
Noted as the strongest warrior of the infamous Kuja tribe, Hancock has immense physical strength. She could perform extremely powerful kicks that can easily break stone (in the form of petrified opponents) as well as take down numerous powerful marine officers and New World pirates with incredible ease, and knock away Smoker, an extremely strong and powerful Marine, with a single Haki enhanced kick.
Her strength is supplemented with tremendous speed and agility, able to land an extremely fast barrage of powerful kicks on numerous marines and New World pirates at once before they could respond. In
Stampede
, Hancock had enough physical power to deal a blow to the awakened form of
Douglas Bullet
, that while left him otherwise unharmed, it was strong enough to be felt.
Hancock has displayed a large degree of durability, after being defeated by Blackbeard and chocked by him in the air she remained composed as he prepared to kill her and was able to remain conscious as he tried to strangle her to death.
Hancock has extraordinary skills in hand-to-hand combat, supplemented with her Devil Fruit abilities. She easily took down numerous powerful and skilled Marine officers as well as powerful pirates from the
New World
. Similar to
Bonney
's and
Sanji
's fighting styles, Hancock's fighting style seems to personally emphasis on powerful and versatile kicks, which can destroy Pacifistas.
Deception, Trickery, and Charisma
Hancock is extremely skilled in the arts of subterfuge and deception, managing to disguise Luffy inside her coat without eliciting much suspicion across an entire boat voyage and inside Impel Down, as well as being the sister to propose spreading the tale of the "Gorgon curse" to prevent her subordinates from discovering the humiliating brand of enslavement on their backs over a period of decades. Hancock is also highly intelligent, sly, and crafty when the situation demands it, being able to buy Luffy time, using her charms, after overhearing
Magellan
's plan to halt his infiltration and managed to manipulate events on Level Six of Impel Down by creating a commotion between the residing prisoners and a "protective" Magellan to speak to
Portgas D. Ace
in private and not attract any attention, as well as stealing the key to Ace's handcuffs for Luffy before his arrival, knowing it would be useful.
Hancock is also a master seductress; she could use her beauty and charm to get whatever she wants. With only Luffy as an exception, both men and women have been shown to be susceptible to her charms which therefore allows her to manipulate people as she desires. Though it might be a secondary effect of her Devil Fruit ability, Hancock is incredibly charismatic, to the point where her claims that she is able to get away with anything because she is beautiful has so far been shown to be true, with her antagonistic actions during the Marineford war seemingly unnoticed despite her openly attacking Marines and declaring her love for Luffy. She even convinced Marine officers to give her all their provisions, which they were prepared to happily do. In Impel Down, she used her charms to convince Magellan to take her down to Level 6 in order to buy Luffy more time, and at Level 6, she used her charms once more to cause a ruckus in order to pass a message to Ace.
Culinary Expertise
Before the timeskip, Hancock was bad at cooking, but became skilled in cooking meat which is Luffy's favorite dish over the course of two years.
Marksmanship
Hancock is very adept in long-range combat and is capable of using her Devil Fruit powers to strike her enemies from a long distance. She has shown great accuracy in using Pistol Kiss in which she accurately shot Luffy who jumped from the Kuja Palace from a very far distance. With the Slave Arrow, she shot down multiple New World Pirates at once, petrifying them in the process.
Devil Fruit
Further information:
Mero Mero no Mi
Hancock using Mero Mero Mellow.
During her time as a slave, Hancock and her sisters were force fed
Devil Fruits
by their
Celestial Dragon
owners as a form of sick entertainment.
Hancock ate the Mero Mero no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type Devil Fruit that allows her petrify people into stone statues, so long as they feel attraction for her. She can completely turn people to stone by hitting them with any of a variety of heart-shaped long-range attacks, as well as partially transform them by striking them physically, only petrifying the area she struck.
Thanks to Hancock's unparalleled beauty and charm, very few people (male and female alike) can resist her powers, allowing her to petrify whole crews with no difficulties. Even extremely powerful people are vulnerable to her power if they find Hancock attractive.
She can also return her victims to normal if she chooses by blowing a kiss. Only she can undo the effects of her power; if she dies, the next user of the Mero Mero no Mi would not be able to free her victims.
A would-be victim is immune to Hancock's power if they block out their "dirty thoughts", such as by feeling strong fear or pain, or if they are simply not attracted to her, such as a blind man not knowing how beautiful she is.
Haki
Main article:
Haki
Hancock is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki.
Supreme King Haki
According to Sandersonia and herself, Hancock possesses the ability to use
Supreme King Haki
.
a rare form of Haki that only one in several million people in the world can use. While she has not yet showcased her usage of it in the manga, Hancock has been seen using it in both
Burning Blood
and
Pirate Warriors 4
.
Armament Haki
Hancock is a highly skilled user of
Armament Haki
, able to combine her kicks with this type of Haki to bypass a
Logia
's intangible defenses.
Observation Haki
Hancock possesses the ability to use
Observation Haki
.
At the end of the
Summit War of Marineford
, she was able to detect that Luffy and the
Heart Pirates
were still alive and had escaped, despite the Admirals' attempts to sink them.
Weapon
Further information:
Salome
Hancock with her snake, Salome.
Hancock carries with her an extra-large white snake with red marks on its body named Salome, that wears a skull with blue hair jutting out of the back and a constant smile. However, aside from using it as a throne as well as to elevate herself above the battle, changing itself into a spiral shape while doing so, she has yet to use it in actual combat.
Salome has the ability to track and sense things on the ocean floor, which was shown when it was able to sense
Whitebeard
's
earthquake
before it arrived and when it helped Hancock follow the Heart Pirates'
submarine
.

Early Concepts
Early design of Hancock from Color Walk 2.
Early concept of Hancock from One Piece Green.
Hancock's earliest seen design appeared initially on the front cover of a 1999 issue of
Shonen Jump
and later was reprinted in
One Piece Color Walk 2
.
When the Straw Hats entered the Grand Line,
Eiichiro Oda
was asked by his editing department to draw villains that would appear from then on. He agreed to and drew their backs for the Shonen Jump cover. While some parts of Hancock's appearance have definitely changed since then, Oda fully intended at the time for the design to be her.
It is revealed in
one of the databooks
that Hancock apparently used to be older than her current version. She was supposed to have a more "evil-based theme" and a scarier look. She also had tattoos on her face and did not have any bangs in the beginning. It is unconfirmed why Oda changed her appearance so much, though it could have been to make her eventual transition to an ally more believable.
Anime and Manga Differences
Appearance
While her size is 191 centimeters in the manga,
Hancock appears to be much taller in the anime (as seen in Impel Down when she and Luffy part ways).
Amazon Lily Arc
In the anime, after Hancock returns to
Momonga
's ship to join the war against
Whitebeard
, she takes the blame for Luffy's stomach growling. When he accidentally groped her while climbing higher up on her body while under her cloak and causing her to blush, she let Momonga pass it off as a fever. When Luffy accidentally sneezed, due to Hancock's long hair brushing against his nose, Hancock once again took the fall by saying that the night air was not good for her body, and despite Momonga suspecting the sneeze sounding like that of a man, she managed to bluff her way out by offering a full-body search, to which Momonga passed.
Luffy in one of Hancock's daydreams.
The anime also elaborates on her daydreams, such as Hancock imagining herself and Luffy kissing. She also has a tendency to imagine Luffy as a
bishōnen
when she daydreams. She also seems to have taken on
Nami
and
Robin
as rivals in love when she learns that they are in
Luffy's crew
, despite the fact that she had not even met them yet (but seems to know what they look like as shown in her imagination). She becomes jealous simply thinking about the fact that he has women in his crew, going so far as to daydream about Luffy choosing them over her. Of course, this makes her vow that she refuses to lose to them. There are also daydream sequences added in the Marineford Arc. After Luffy hugs her at Marineford, Hancock visualizes Luffy and herself at a wedding ceremony with the Kuja tribe as the guests. Then she imagined Luffy and herself on a honeymoon where she was preparing meals for Luffy.
Impel Down Arc
Her visit to Impel Down was also further elaborated, silently telling
Ace
that Luffy was also in Impel Down trying to save him, in a tone that apparently only Ace could hear (
Jinbe
had to be told about it later).
All of these are technically not differences but additions; they all follow actions believable to her character. The main purpose of this was to lengthen the time shown with Hancock and Luffy on the Marine ship, before going into the Impel Down Arc. This was done to show the "Friends' Whereabouts" filler over four episodes rather than over one and a half chapters in order to slow down the anime plotline so that it did not catchup to the manga. There had not been enough time in the plotline to insert any fillers since before the
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
, as the anime plotline was progressing ahead quite quickly.
Marineford Arc
During the pinnacle of the war, she stopped bazooka-wielding soldiers from targeting Luffy, under the claim that they would hit
Garp
as well, in which she added that he would be her grandfather-in-law when she and Luffy marry. How she knew of this heritage is unknown, as the world did not receive this knowledge until after the war, and there was no indication that she got word of this beforehand in either the manga or the anime. After Ace had been set free, Hancock appears behind Jinbe,
Kingdew
, and
Blenheim
while she did not in the manga.
Return to Sabaody Arc
Hancock's dress is colored red in the anime instead of blue, like in the manga.
Translation and Dub Issues
In the English manga serialization in the American Shonen Jump magazine, Hancock is edited to wear a shirt with her blouse in order to hide her cleavage. However, this is only for the magazine serialization.
