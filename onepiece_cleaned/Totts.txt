Personality
[
]
As a child, Totts was once somewhat of a bully alongside Gyogyo, throwing rocks at Kuma because he thought the boy was lying about his age. However, after Kuma used his powers to heal Totts from Ginny's assault, they became friends.
Totts was attracted to Ginny like many of the boys in Sorbet. He was also fiercely loyal to Kuma, starting riots at the kingdom's Castle Town after Kuma was unjustly imprisoned for protesting the enslavement of citizens.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Totts's overall abilities are unknown, but Conney stated that he, much like the other fishmongers of Sorbet, was quite formidable in a fight, saying that other pirates and sea beasts would run at the sight of his strength. Despite this, however, he is clearly no match for the strength of the
Blackbeard Pirates
.
History

Past
[
]
Totts grew up in the
Sorbet Kingdom
. As a child, he and Gyogyo threw rocks at
Bartholomew Kuma
because they did not believe the unusually large boy was really nine years old. The boys were subsequently heavily beaten up by
Ginny
. However, Kuma showed compassion towards them and
pushed away their pain
. Afterwards, Totts and Gyogyo befriended Kuma and Ginny and helped them carry wood to sell it.
25 years ago, Totts was smitten with Ginny and once brought fish to Kuma's church to gift to her alongside Gyogyo. 22 years ago, Totts and other men joined Ginny in an attempt to free Kuma from jail, but the group was defeated and arrested. They were freed when
Monkey D. Dragon
and the
Freedom Fighters
overthrew the corrupt king
Bekori
.
Over 7 years ago, while visiting Kuma in his now light-proofed church, Totts learned that Ginny's daughter,
Bonney
, had started developing
Sapphire Scales
symptoms. He then started looking for
doctors
around the kingdom that could help in identifying and treating it.
3 and a half years ago, Totts welcomed Bonney back to the kingdom after her six-month treatment at
Egghead
.
At some point following this, he was asked by
Conney
to accompany Bonney on her escape from the
World Government
's "protection" of her. After remodelling their fishing ship into a
pirate ship
, Totts and the other fishermen of Sorbet waited for Bonney at a port and quickly set sail when she arrived. Soon after, they witnessed Bonney taking down a pursuing
Alpha
and cheered for her.
This moment was the foundation and the start of the Bonney Pirates and their goal was to search for their captain's father and their friend, Kuma. Later they heard that Kuma appeared on an island so they disembarked and searched there, but unfortunately couldn't find him because he
teleported
away from the island.
