As an officer of the

and captains his own ship.

An army of Big Mom Pirates march against Luffy.
After
Charlotte Cracker

and
Nami

Once the
Straw Hat Pirates
were defeated and restrained, the army returned to Sweet City with the captive pirates.
When the Straw Hats tried to escape
Totto Land
after ruining
Pudding
and
Sanji
's wedding, Brownie took his ship to
Cacao Island
to help stand guard in preparation for an attack on the Straw Hats, but after seeing how many of his siblings and crewmates had gathered just for fewer than ten people, he decided to go to sleep instead, telling his subordinates to wake him up if something happened.
He later woke up when the Big Mom Pirates' fleet was under attack by
Germa 66
.
He was then preoccupied with fighting Germa's forces that he did not notice
Oven
's command to stop Luffy and Sanji from escaping overhead.
After the Straw Hats escaped, Brownie cheered as
Big Mom
herself arrived to the battlefield.
