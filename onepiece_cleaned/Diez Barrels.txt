Diez Barrels
was a
Marine
officer who defected to become a
pirate
. Thirteen years ago, he was the
captain
of the
Barrels Pirates
while operating in the North Blue until he was killed by
Donquixote Doflamingo
during an attempt to sell the
Ope Ope no Mi
to the Marines.
He was also the father of
X Drake
.
Appearance
[
]
Barrels was a large, fair-skinned man with a prominent chin, pointed nose, and small ears. He had short orange hair, much like his son, that is slicked back, a predominant widow's peak, and sideburns. He wore a dark-colored buttoned shirt and a light colored pirate-style coat.
Personality
[
]
During his time as a Marine officer, he was apparently someone to look up to, as his son,
Drake
, did. However, once he became a pirate, he became crueler and started physically abusing Drake.
Barrels was quite naive, setting up a deal to sell the Ope Ope no Mi to the Marines. He did, however, realize the fruit's potential, despite not wanting it for himself, though he did not know of the ability to grant immortality; Doflamingo regarded him as a fool for not knowing the true value of the fruit's powers.
His greed for monetary value made him focus more on retrieving the fruit when it was stolen by
Donquixote Rosinante
than tending to his own injuries.

X Drake

X Drake is Barrels' son. When Drake was a child, he looked up to his father for being a Marine officer, and wished to emulate the man. However, when Barrels descended to piracy, he started to abuse his son physically. Drake, however, continued to see the good of his past father, and continued to follow him.
Their father-son relationship permanently broke down when
Donquixote Doflamingo
attacked their hideout, the pirates and Marines alike were moving against their will in an entrapped cage, Drake, the only one who was outside of the containment field, immediately fled,
leaving his father behind. Barrels' last words were cursing Drake's absence in their greatest hour of need.
Because of this, Drake held no grudge against Doflamingo for killing his father, showing that Barrels had ultimately lost his son's respect and love for him.
Barrels called his son Dory
