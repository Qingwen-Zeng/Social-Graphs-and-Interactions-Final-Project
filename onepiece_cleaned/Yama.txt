Appearance
[
]
Yama is an obese man with a triple chin. He has a round body shape with long wavy black hair and tanned skin. He has bags under his eyes and thick lips. He wears a white toga with black vertical stripes, three on each side. Over his toga he has an orange sash, connected by strings, and has red lining and dark orange vertical stripes on it. Yama wears gold bracelets on both his wrist, and has wings on his back, like other
Birkans
.
Personality
[
]
Yama is fanatically loyal to Enel, going so far as to reprimand
Shura
,
Ohm
, and
Gedatsu
for fighting in his presence.
He displays quite an amount of brutality in battle.
His ruthless fighting style gives him little respect for the world around him, as seen when he destroyed the ruins of
Shandora
during his fight with
Robin
.
He has a habit of often exclaiming "Baa!" and "Meriya!"
Abilities and Powers

Physical Abilities
[
]
Despite his massive build, Yama is very acrobatic, agile, and fast. His comparatively tiny limbs are very strong as well. He was able to simply kick an iron ball fired from
Genbo
's Bazooka back to him,
and was able to smash right through the ruins of
Shandora
with ease.
Aside from his crush and slice method, he also uses powerful punches, kicks, and normal body slams combined with acrobatics to inflict heavy damage, courtesy of his immense weight and figure.

History

Past
[
]
After destroying
Birka
,
Enel
and
his army
came to
Skypiea
. They defeated
Gan Fall
, his
Divine Squad
, and the
Shandians
and then took over the
Upper Yard
.
Sky Island Saga
[
]
Skypiea Arc
[
]
In God's Shrine of the
Upper Yard
, Yama stood next to
Enel
's throne and told off
Shura
,
Ohm
, and
Gedatsu
for fighting in Enel's presence.
Yama later took the
Divine Soldiers
to combat the invading
Shandian
army and the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Later in the Survival Game, Yama fought against
Genbo
. After Genbo easily defeated Yama's underlings, the commander himself stepped into the fray. Though Genbo fought hard, Yama effectively crushed Genbo by deflecting the cannonball fired from his own weapon back to him. Yama finished the fight by stabbing Genbo with his
Ten-Fold Axe
. While wandering through the forest, he came upon
Nico Robin
, who was studying the ruins of
Shandora
.
Yama wrecks the ancient city.
Yama attacked Robin
and did not notice (or did not care) that he was destroying the ruins.
She ran from him in an attempt to limit the damage he would cause to the ruins, but he still damaged much of it in his rage at chasing her. When she reached a clearing and stopped running, Yama tried to jump kick her, so she grabbed his feet with
thirty hands
and swung him into a tree. When he tried to use his Ten-Fold Axe on her, she covered his eyes and flipped over his sash of dials so they would cut into him as he slammed into a tree.
Robin defeats Yama.
After this beating, Yama begged and apologized to Robin, saying that he now understood the value of history. Robin ignored his plea, stating that what he did was still inexcusable. When Yama tried to grab Robin, she broke his fingers with her extra arms and used Cien Fleur: Delphinium to hurl the commander off a cliff and down to a lower level of Upper Yard and held him in a lock position to increase the potential impact. She then used Doce Fleur: Clutch to snap him before he crashed into the ground.
Once the war ended, Yama and the other priests (excluding Gedatsu) were banished to
Cloud Drifting
.
