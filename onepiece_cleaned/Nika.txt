Appearance
[
]
It is said that Nika looked like the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika's awakened form, known as Gear 5 by the current user, Monkey D. Luffy.
Based on his single, silhouetted appearance, Nika seemed to be a lanky, warrior-like figure with noodly limbs and flame-shaped hair. He apparently wore something on his thighs, but nothing else. According to Dr. Vegapunk, Luffy's
awakened form
looks like Nika as he was described in ancient texts.
Personality
[
]
According to the legend heard by
Who's-Who
, Nika was a heroic and benevolent figure, a friend of slaves and adored by them. It was said that Nika would one day come to free the slaves from their oppressive masters and bring smiles to their faces, while spreading joy wherever he went.
Powers and Abilities
[
]
The legend states that Nika was a great warrior. In his silhouette appearance, he was seen holding a
sword
and a
spear
.
Nika's signature trait was his body having the composition of rubber, which allowed him to fight in just about any manner he could think of.
The variety of ways one could fight with this ability can be seen with
Monkey D. Luffy
and his usage of the fruit modeled after Nika.

Legend
[
]
Bartholomew Kuma, a believer of the legend, mimics Nika's dance along with his friends and family.
Nika has been worshipped since ancient times by slaves who believed that he would eventually come to free them from their suffering. It is, however, unknown if such a figure actually existed or not, although Dr.
Vegapunk
has confirmed the existence of ancient records that mention him, and the legend of Nika was passed from father to son in the Buccaneer race for several generations. The
giants
are also aware of the legend as the entity is revered as a Sun God in Elbaph. Thus far, two giants have claimed the title;
Road
presided over his
diorama
with that title, while the "Accursed Prince"
Loki
declared himself the future Sun God. Those legends include an all-white appearance, the ability to stretch like rubber and a personal rhythm known as the "Drums of Liberation".
Who's-Who
, a former member of
CP9
who was once imprisoned for his failure to safeguard the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, heard about the legend from an unnamed prison guard and then started giving his prayers for Nika with the intent of easing his own suffering. When Who's-Who noticed that the same prison guard who told him about the legend suddenly vanished from duty, he suspected that the story was not meant to be shared and that the
World Government
had done something to the guard. He then decided to break out of prison in order to escape a potentially worse punishment for knowing too much.
Who's-Who mentioned Nika to
Jinbe
during their fight, as the former associated the
fish-man
race with
slavery
, and asked Jinbe about the legend. Angered with the assumption of the relationship between fish-men and slavery, Jinbe chose not to respond and instead delivered a critical blow upon Who's-Who.
Devil Fruit
[

Main article:
Gomu Gomu no Mi
The Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, now known as the Gomu Gomu no Mi.
Although it is unknown whether a "true" Nika has ever existed, there exists a
Mythical Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
called the
Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika
that allows the consumer to gain Nika's abilities, with the earliest known user being
Joy Boy
.
Ever since his death, the World Government had been extremely interested in this fruit for centuries, and for unknown reasons, this interest is of a nature that has led them to erase the fruit's existence and original name from all historical recordings, renaming it to the "Gomu Gomu no Mi" and reclassifying it as a
Paramecia
.
Despite the government's efforts to seek after it, the fruit managed to elude them, to the point where one of the
Five Elders
in the present day questioned if the fruit itself was nothing more than a legend as well.
Considering that Zoan-type Devil Fruits have a will of their own and they have failed to obtain it for 800 years, some of them even wondered if the Devil Fruit itself could actually be running away from them.
The government finally acquired this fruit around 13 years before the present day, but it was stolen from one of their ships by the
Red Hair Pirates
. Ironically, it was Who's-Who that was stationed on the ship, and it was his failure to prevent the fruit's theft that led to him being imprisoned and learning about Nika.
The fruit was later eaten by a 7-year-old boy named
Monkey D. Luffy
who found it lying around with the Red Hair Pirates and mistook it for dessert, and he has possessed this power ever since. While the Red Hair Pirates were aghast when they discovered Luffy had eaten the fruit, it remains unclear if they were aware of the fruit's true nature.
Luffy in a pose identical to Nika.
After his last defeat against
Kaidou
,
Luffy managed to awaken the fruit's powers,
the first time after centuries.
When Luffy realized his new powers, he leaped through the sky in a pose identical to Who's-Who and
Clapp
's description of Nika.
Years prior, when
Bartholomew Kuma
was informing
Jewelry Bonney
about Nika, he also took the pose when teaching his daughter about the rhythm that Nika laughed to.
The two took a similar pose alongside
Sentomaru
,
Vegapunk
and
Kizaru
during
Egghead
's Fabiriophase's construction.
Later, Bonney also used
her power
to imitate Nika.
