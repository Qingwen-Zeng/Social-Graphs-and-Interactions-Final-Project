History

Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
When
Big Mom
developed a craving for croquembouche and went on a rampage through Sweet City, Galette's brother
Moscato
tried to calm her, but she was hostile towards him. Galette,
Opera
, and
Mont-d'Or
pleaded for her not to attack Moscato, but she pulled away Moscato's lifespan, shocking the three siblings and the other citizens of Sweet City. Big Mom was later satiated by
Jinbe
.
Later, Galette ordered some soldiers to hurry and remove Moscato's body.
Galette, Mont-d'Or, and Opera gather around their defeated brother Cracker.
Two days later, Galette, Opera, and Mont-d'Or witnessed a defeated
Cracker
flying into Sweet City. They were appalled to see one of the Sweet Commanders defeated, and Galette noted that Cracker was last seen heading for the Seducing Woods to handle
Monkey D. Luffy
, which meant that Luffy was responsible for Cracker's defeat.
After Sweet City was put in high alert, Galette and an army of
Big Mom Pirates
marched towards Luffy's location and began battling him.
Nami
brought down a large lightning bolt before Galette immobilized her with
her Devil Fruit ability
, expressing surprise at Nami's powerful attack. After
Amande
removed a
Vivre Card
from Nami, Galette realized that it was how the
Straw Hat Pirates
made the
homies
powerless. They then learned that the Vivre Card came from
Lola
, surprising them. The army headed back to Sweet City to report to Big Mom with the captive Straw Hats in tow.
In the Prisoner Library, Galette sat on a couch with her siblings and watched Big Mom talk to Luffy and Nami through a
Den Den Mushi
.
After Big Mom finished her conversation with the prisoners,
Anglais
arrived to inform Galette and her siblings that an intruder broke into the Room of Treasure.
Later, Galette attended a meeting to go over the statuses of the Sanji Retrieval Team and the
Vinsmoke Family
.
Galette attended the
Tea Party
and wedding of
Sanji
and
Charlotte Pudding
, and listened to
Vinsmoke Niji
.
During the chaos initiated by Luffy and his group, Luffy caused Big Mom to start screaming. While shielding her ears, Galette noticed that Big Mom scraped her knees.
She continued to cover her ears as
Capone Bege
,
Vito
, and
Gotti
launched
their weapons
at Big Mom. However, Big Mom's scream destroyed the weapons before they could hit her. Galette was then given
mochi earplugs
by
Katakuri
, and the Big Mom Pirates proceeded to surround Luffy and Bege's groups, forcing Bege to
transform into a fortress
to save his allies.
Galette and her siblings subdue Reiju and the Straw Hats.
After Bege returned to human form,
Caesar Clown
attempted to flee the venue with Bege in tow while Luffy, Sanji, and the Vinsmoke Family faced off against the Big Mom Pirates. In the ensuing conflict, Galette, Smoothie, and Daifuku subdued Luffy, Sanji, and
Reiju
with Galette's power as they were falling back. However, at that moment, the
Tamatebako
dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and exploded, causing the castle to collapse.
As she was falling off the castle, Galette started screaming for Katakuri to save her, which he soon did. The castle was then turned into cake by
Streusen
, saving the crew from death.
Aboard the
Queen Mama Chanter
, Galette watched as the the
Sun Pirates
saved the
Thousand Sunny
and held back the Big Mom Pirates from pursuing the Straw Hats.
Wano Country Saga

Wano Country Arc
[

When Big Mom tried to infiltrate
Wano Country
, Galette accompanied her mother and crew as they attempted to climb the waterfall into the country on the Queen Mama Chanter. However, just before they reached the top of the waterfall,
King
attacked the ship, causing it to fall off the waterfall and Big Mom to fall into the sea.
On the seas near Wano, Galette reflected on their current situation with the rest of her family. When
Perospero
brought up the fact that Big Mom's Vivre Card was intact, meaning that she was still alive, Galette noted that, being in enemy territory, Big Mom probably had been captured.
The crew later heard about Big Mom's newly formed alliance with Kaidou. On the day of the
Fire Festival
, the Big Mom Pirates attempted to climb the waterfall again, but their ship was knocked down by
Marco
.
