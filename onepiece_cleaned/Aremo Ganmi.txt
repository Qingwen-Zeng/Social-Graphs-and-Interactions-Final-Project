In both of her appearances so far, she has always had her hands covering most of her face except for her eyes.
Personality
[
]
She is a very shy woman.
She has a habit of covering her face with her hands but leaving large gaps in her fingers so that she can still see perfectly well.
History
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
She was first seen as a spectator watching the B block battle royale. While witnessing the brutality of a
little fighting fish
against the competitors who fell into the water, she covered her face with both hands, but left gaps between her ring and little fingers to see through.
She did the same thing shortly after, upon witnessing
Bartolomeo
standing at the edge of the ring and openly urinating.
She was later seen watching C Block, when
Hajrudin
crushed
Ucy
and
Luffy
. She reacted by only covering her mouth with her hands, and was seen with her eyes closed for the first time.
She also screamed out when
Kelly Funk
brutally kept punching a gladiator who was already defeated, while peeking through her fingers with one eye open.
Manga and Anime Differences
[
]
As a background character without any importance outside of the SBS question in which she was named, she has been drawn inconsistently in all of her anime appearances.
