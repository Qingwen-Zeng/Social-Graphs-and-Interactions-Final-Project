Ottoland
is one of the
Franky Family
's
Kairiki Destroyers
.
Appearance
[
]
Ottoland's initial colorscheme in the
Digitally Colored Manga
.
Ottoland is a large, muscular man with brown, unruly hair and fleshy lips. He wears the
Franky Family
uniform, consisting of a metal lederhosen with a pink star and a pair of specialized goggles, as well as a bandana with a star, round shoulder pads, and green shorts.
Like the other
Kairiki Destroyers
, Ottoland is an abnormally large human, reaching up above the legs of regular-sized
giants
and towering above the other members of the Franky Family.
In his initial appearance in the
Digitally Colored Manga
, Ottoland's hair was a much lighter shade of brown, and his bandana was gray instead of beige. His later appearances match the anime.
Personality
[
]
Ottoland is very loyal to the
Franky Family
and
Franky
himself, referring to him as his big brother. He is very confident in his strength, and believes he's not inferior to any
giants
.
His loyalty to Franky is such that he is even willing to invading the
World Government
's island on his behalf, participating in the raid on
Enies Lobby
with the rest of the Family.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Due to Ottoland's large size, he has remarkable strength, well above that of an average human. Having gained his immense strength from his experience dismantling ships, he is considered one of the strongest members of the Franky Family,
though his strength is not enough to handle more powerful opponents like
giants
.
Weapons
[
]
Ottoland wields a giant axe, though he was defeated by
Kashii
and
Oimo
before he got a chance to properly use it.
History
[
]
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
Ottoland was at the
Franky House
when the
Franky Family
members who robbed
Usopp
returned with their gains.
He presumably participated in the subsequent celebration and battle against the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
He later joined the rest of the Franky Family as they followed after the
Rocketman
to
Enies Lobby
.
When a large wave threatened to derail them, he participated in the Franky Family's barrage of bullets using a handheld cannon, and cheered with
Dago
when they made it through.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Upon reaching Enies Lobby, the Franky Family, including Ottoland, charged onto the island to begin their assault.
Forcing their way into the island, Ottoland and the other
Destroyers
made their way to the
main gate
, successfully pushing it open and allowing their forces through. There, they ran into the
giants
Oimo
and
Kashii
, stopping them in their tracks.
After confirming with the other Destroyers, the trio charged into the giants in a bid to motivate the other members of the Franky Family; however, Ottoland was kicked by the two giants and collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
Later, when escaping from Enies Lobby, Ottoland's unconscious body was tied to Oimo with rope.
At some point between Oimo being fired on by the
Buster Call
and their exit from the island, he woke up, and cheered aboard the
Puffing Tom
as they rolled away.
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Ottoland participated in the party thrown to celebrate everyone's escape from Enies Lobby.
He later joined the Franky Family when they begged
Luffy
to take
Franky
out to sea.
After Luffy accepted, the entire family went to convince Franky, though he initially refused to join; in response, the Family stole his underwear and drew him to the
Thousand Sunny
, where Luffy attempted to recruit him.
As Franky finally accepted Luffy's invitation, the entire Family cried, watching from a distance.
After the Straw Hats left
Water 7
, the Franky Family began planning for the future, running into
Iceburg
and being invited to join the
Galley-La Company
.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, the
Kairiki Destroyers
are not carried off
Enies Lobby
by
Oimo
and
Kashii
, leaving their return to the
Puffing Tom
unexplained.
Mysteriously, Ottoland is absent from the
Franky Family
's closing shot in
Episode 324
.
Footbianco
is moved to his position, with his original position is simply left empty.
In
Episode of Merry
, Ottoland is missing from the scene of
Franky
being presented with
Usopp
's
200,000,000.
