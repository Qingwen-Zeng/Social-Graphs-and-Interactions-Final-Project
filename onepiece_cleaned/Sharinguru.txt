Shari Shari no Mi
Sharinguru attacking Franky.
Sharinguru ate the Shari Shari no Mi, a
Paramecia
-class
Devil Fruit
that allows him to rotate his body parts like wheels.
He can use this to drive against his opponents to inflict scraping damage. However, targets with a higher defense, such as
Franky
's metallic body, are resistant to this, thus proving the fruit's rotating velocity or overall piercing powers to be rather low. This power was shown only in the manga.
Swordsmanship

In the anime, Sharinguru used a sword against Franky instead of his Devil Fruit powers.
