History
[
]
102 years ago, Raideen was a member of the
Giant Warrior Pirates
. One day, the captains
Dorry
and
Brogy
caught massive
Sea Kings
and the crew celebrated by drinking together on an island.
Sixty-three years before the present day, Raideen trained
Hajrudin
in combat, intending to make his pupil stronger so he could join the
Giant Warrior Pirates
once either
Dorry
or
Brogy
returned from their duel. The two dueled, with Raideen overpowering his student.
Jorul
and
Jarul
then came to the village and Raideen greeted them.
Seven days later, during the Winter Solstice fast,
Charlotte Linlin
went on a rampage to find semla. After she fatally injured Jorul, Raideen held Hajrudin back as his student yelled at Jarul to kill her.
