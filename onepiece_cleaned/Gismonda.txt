Sometime later, Gismonda met with Lucci and informed him that Mad Treasure could not get the treasure as it had vanished into the sea. Questioning if they should search for it, Lucci decided to leave it as is since it was to maintain the balance of the world. Gismonda then agreed with Lucci that he believed
