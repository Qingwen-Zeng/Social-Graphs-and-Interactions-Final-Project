History

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
When the
World Government
had ordered to eliminate
Vegapunk
, Pomsky, alongside
Jaygarcia Saturn
,
Kizaru
, and eight other
Vice Admirals
, led a Marine fleet to besiege the island of
Egghead
.
After Kizaru had infiltrated Egghead, the Marines managed to make landfall. Pomsky found
Jewelry Bonney
hiding and tried to attack her, but she countered with
NDE
to incapacitate his subordinates before running off. After
Sanji
tried to rescue Bonney, Pomsky transformed into his sea otter form and tried striking at them again, but they dodged it.
He was later attacked by
Bartholomew Kuma
as the buccaneer had arrived at Egghead to save Bonney from being executed by Saturn.
Pomsky is kicked by Bonney.
Saturn then ordered a
Buster Call
, and the Marines started evacuating. During the attack, Pomsky commanded for the ships to fire and destroy Egghead.
As the
Pacifista
fell under Bonney's control, the ships were being targeted. Vice Admiral
Tosa
reported to the Marines that he went after Bonney. However, after not getting any further contact, Pomsky deduced he was defeated and went to deal with it.
Red King
and
Guillotine
joined him and intercepted Bonney's group before they could reach the
Giant Warrior Pirates
' ship.
During the ensuing fight, Pomsky moved to attack Bonney, insulting her and stating that she had no right to control the Pacifista. In response, Bonney
transformed
Pomsky into a child, and proceeded to deliver a powerful kick while Guillotine watched in horror.
A while later, the transformation wore off and Pomsky returned to his adult form. When
Emet
unleashed a powerful concentration of
Supreme King Haki
that
Joy Boy
had locked inside its body, Pomsky questioned who the Haki belonged to before being knocked unconscious.
After the Straw Hats and Giant Pirates escaped Egghead, the Vice Admirals met with Saturn about what to do next. Saturn explained that their biggest concern was not the pirates, but that Vegapunk's broadcast had reached the world. However, Saturn's body suddenly started withering away by
Imu
's powers. The Vice Admirals tried to help him, but his body subsequently exploded with only his skeleton remaining.
