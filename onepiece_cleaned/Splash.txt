Splash
and
Splatter
are two
newkama
pirate
twins. They both willingly donated blood to
Sanji
when he was dying of severe blood loss.
Appearance
[
]
Anime concept art of Splash and Splatter.
Being twins, Splash and Splatter look almost exactly the same. They are both muscular and have exaggerated male facial features, which are covered with excessive make-up. They have spiked eyebrows and long spiked hair. They wear the
Criminal
brand and are almost always flexing.
The key differences between them is that Splash has brown hair and wears a pink shirt, with light pink edges and a yellow star on the chest, and black tights, while Splatter has blond hair and wears a white shirt, with blue edges and a red star on the chest, and black tights. In
Gigant Battle 2
, they wear purple and yellow.
Personalities
[
]
Splash and Splatter both act very effeminate and brag about their physiques by showing off their muscles. They are kind-hearted individuals as they willingly donated their blood to save a fellow human life. They end all of their sentences with the word "silly"
(
バカん
,
bakan
?
)
, followed by a heart, showing the "feminine tone" being used in speech.
Their dream is to visit the
Kamabakka Kingdom
.
Powers and Abilities
[
]
Not much is known about their abilities, but they seem to be stealthy enough to evade being captured by the
New Fish-Man Pirates
, whereas other pirates like
Gyro
and
his crew
were not so lucky.
In the anime, they seem to have some knowledge of medicine judging from their nurse outfits, though this was likely just a gimmick.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
They have apparently been on
Fish-Man Island
for quite some time before the
Straw Hats
arrive since
Camie
stated that
Luffy
and his crew are the first visitors in a month.
Fish-Man Island Arc
[
]
When
Sanji
suffered critical blood loss, Splash and Splatter volunteered to donate blood to him since none of the
Fish-Men
or
Merfolk
were willing due to an unspoken law. When Sanji regained consciousness, Splash showed his right hand, making Sanji think that they were actual ladies until both newkamas fully revealed themselves to him, much to Sanji's horror.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Splash and Splatter dressed as nurses in an extra scene in the anime.
In the anime, they are shown again during a scene when Sanji starts fantasizing about
Nami
and
Robin
and is about to lose more blood.
Tony Tony Chopper
calls Splash and Splatter who appear in pink nurse mini dresses and attempt to treat him. Sanji freaks out upon seeing them which naturally makes him snap out of his perverted dreams and prevents another nose bleed.
