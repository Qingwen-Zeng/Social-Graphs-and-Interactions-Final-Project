Zou Arc
[
]
Bariete falls onto the Straw Hats.
Bariete was guarding the entry gate to
Mokomo Dukedom
when he noticed the
Straw Hat Pirates
and their allies scaling
Zunesha
's leg. In an attempt to prevent them from entering Zou, he jumped off and crashed into
Kin'emon
and
Kanjuro
, causing them to fall with him down to the
Thousand Sunny
.
The samurai and Bariete later attempted to climb to Zou using a cat created by Kanjuro's
Devil Fruit
powers, but the attempt failed due to the water from Zunesha's self-washing dissolving Kanjuro's drawing.
After this, they went back to the Thousand Sunny and planned to climb up to Zou the next day.
The following morning, they finally reached the top of Zou, where Kin'emon asked Bariete about
Raizo
. However, Bariete ran away from them and intended to announce their presence to the
Mink Tribe
.
Once he arrived at the Mokomo Dukedom, Bariete rang the Bell of Welcoming, alerting both the minks and the Straw Hats.
When
Jack
returned, he attempted to destroy Zou by killing Zunesha, who retaliated on
Momonosuke
's command and sank Jack's fleet with one blow. Having witnessed this, Bariete informed the Mink Tribe of Jack's defeat.
Soon afterward, as the
Sanji
retrieval team departed from Zou, Bariete and the others were shocked when
Luffy
jumped off Zunesha with his party.
After the Sanji retrieval team left Zou, Bariete informed
Wanda
that
Carrot
went with them and apologized to her for allowing Carrot to leave unnoticed. However, Wanda forgave him, which prompted Bariete to eat happily one of the bananas with which Carrot bribed him.

Bariete went to
Wano Country
with the
Inuarashi Musketeer Squad
and other minks, leaving behind his guard post on Zou. During the

, he accompanied
Shishilian
after his defeat by Jack. Bariete and Shishilian later came across
Nekomamushi
and informed him that
Pedro
's "killer",
Charlotte Perospero
, was also on Onigashima.
After the raid, Bariete was seen partying with the other Minks during the celebration banquet.
