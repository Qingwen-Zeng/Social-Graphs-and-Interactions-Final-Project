Stronger
is the horse that
Doc Q
rides on. Because Doc Q is seemingly always sick, he rides on Stronger all the time, since the doctor tends to collapse if left unsupported for some time; however, Stronger is just as sick as he is. He is classified as a Type A creature, "Big Friendly".
Appearance
[
]
Stronger is a pale blue horse with very long legs. He has a white mane that covers his eyes. His ears also stick up out of the unruly mane and he wears a thin brown bridle.
Personality
[
]
Stronger is very loyal to his rider,
Doc Q
, as he is always seen carrying him, whether during a fight with
Ace
or after being
poisoned
by
Magellan
. He, like his owner, seems to always be sick.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Despite being a very sick horse, Stronger has the strength and stamina to carry around
Doc Q
for an extended period of time and only succumbed to exhaustion on an occasional basis. He can also gallop with extraordinary speed while carrying his master as shown in the anime when
Teach
ordered his
crew
to kill
Whitebeard
, Stronger enabled his master to land a hit on Whitebeard after
Shiryu
. Despite his sickly constitution, Stronger has great endurance, being completely submerged in
Magellan
's
deadly venom
and also took a
shockwave attack
from
Sengoku
.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Stronger flies as a Pegasus.
Further information:
Uma Uma no Mi, Model: Pegasus
Stronger ate the Uma Uma no Mi, Model: Pegasus, a
Mythical Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a Pegasus hybrid and a full Pegasus at will. Since he is already a horse, this power basically just allows him to grow wings and fly.
With his powers, he was able to carry both Doc Q and
Blackbeard
while airborne, albeit the latter being of crushing weight for him.

flew
with Doc Q above the crew's ship, while the latter infected the enemies with
his power
. Shortly after the Heart Pirates reached the island's surface, Teach hopped onto Stronger's back to carry him there, and the horse struggled to carry the Commodore.

to cut Stronger in two, causing the horse and the men to fall toward the ocean. As they fell, Doc Q believed Stronger to be dead and congratulated him for being a good boy, though the horse talked back to its master.
Subsequently, the crew managed to defeat the Heart Pirates, leaving almost all of them in the sea along with the sunken and destroyed Polar Tang.
