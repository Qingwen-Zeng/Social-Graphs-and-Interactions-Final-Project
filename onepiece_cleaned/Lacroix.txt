Anime and Manga Differences

During the preparations of the battle formation before Whitebeard's appearance at the Marine Headquarters, he was giving lower ranking soldiers orders about to not hesitate and states that no matter what everything was going to end in three hours. In the manga this speech was said by Vice Admiral
John Giant
. In the anime, it shows him fighting
Little Oars Jr.
until his sword is shattered by him.
