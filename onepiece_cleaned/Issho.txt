Issho
, better known by his alias
Fujitora
, is an
Admiral
in the
Marines
.
Once the military chief of the former
Aoi Kingdom
,
he was conscripted through a World Military Draft during the two-year timeskip, being appointed to fill one of the Admiral vacancies caused by
Kuzan
's resignation and
Sakazuki
's promotion alongside his co-worker
Ryokugyu
.
A proponent of "Humane Justice", Fujitora notably spearheaded a campaign for the abolishment of the "
Seven Warlords of the Sea
" system,
which came to pass during the most recent
Levely
.
Fujitora was first mentioned by Sakazuki when the latter was discussing plans to deal with
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Trafalgar Law
on
Dressrosa
.
His following mission and actions on Dressrosa made him the first Admiral to physically appear post-timeskip and the secondary antagonist of the
Dressrosa Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Fujitora is a blind man with only the whites of his eyes showing, though he usually keeps both eyes closed. He has an X-shaped scar centered on the left side of his forehead that stretches over both eyes, which was actually self-inflicted due to his decision to blind himself.
He has short dark hair, a mustache, and a beard.
He seems to be very tall, a trait shared with other Admirals.
Like other Admirals, Fujitora sports the standard Marine coat with his personal clothes underneath, wearing the coat on his shoulders like a cape with his arms not in the sleeves. His sleeves' cuffs are purple. While previous admirals and other high-ranked Marines wear the conventional suit and tie underneath their Marine coats, Fujitora opts for a light-purple yukata held up with a dark purple belt, all underneath a purple cloak, matching the color in his alias. Fujitora wields a
shikomizue
(a Japanese
swordstick
) that doubles as a cane for his blindness, and also wears
geta sandals
. He has white bandages wrapped around both of his forearms, with handguards on both hands.
In
One Piece Film: Red
, Fujitora wears a gray yukata and more muted purple cloak, with a Marine coat that has both its cuffs and insides purple.

Personality
[
]
Fujitora is a virtuous and benevolent man who puts great emphasis on doing the right thing while preventing misfortune for others. He detests evil to such a strong degree that he blinded himself on purpose, inflicting damage on his eyes out of sorrow for all the evil he had seen,
with him stating in Dressrosa that not having sight is a blessing.
His
Justice
motto as a Marine is "Humane Justice"
(
仁義ある正義
,
Jingi aru Seigi
?
, VIZ: "Virtuous Justice")
.
His primary goal is to protect people, telling a subordinate that it is more important to take into account the number of lives to protect rather than the number of enemies against them.
He takes care to never put innocent civilians in harm's way during conflict and will try to avoid causing collateral damage with his attacks; when he does inflict such damage, he makes sure to compensate the owner of the involved property. Fujitora will make the effort to keep civilians away from harm even when he himself is not involved in the proceedings, including doing things such as protecting them from the collateral damage of other fights and even proactively calling for extra medics to come to the Corrida Colosseum in the likely event that spectators were harmed by the combatants' attacks. As a result of his desire to protect civilians, Fujitora is proactive about hunting down and capturing pirates and other criminals. He will not step outside his bounds to do so, as shown when he came to the Corrida Colosseum which was a safe zone for criminals, but he did plot with his subordinates to arrest the criminals competing there as soon as they exited the arena's confines.
Fujitora's desire to eliminate evil also extends to rooting out corruption within the Marines and World Government. Events in
Arabasta
in particular drove him to question the government's choices and judgment, especially regarding the use of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
as a check against pirates and criminals. Experience made Fujitora believe to his core that the Warlord system often resulted in brutal and tyrannical pirates terrorizing people, shipping arms, and committing murder under the blanket of government immunity, or worse, endorsement. He held out hope that ending the system would result in better outcomes for eliminating piracy and evil, despite its perceived threat to the balance of the
Three Great Powers
.
Humility and responsibility run deep within Fujitora, as he is willing to accept blame for his shortcomings, along with those of the Marines and World Government. Fujitora refuses to take credit for things he did not do and is disturbed by the idea of the World Government using his image and authority to shape a narrative about world events to their own benefit. This sense of honor is so strong that he is willing to prostrate himself before King
Riku Doldo III
, along with his troops, to apologize for the harm and havoc of Doflamingo's actions within Riku's kingdom, and broadcasting said apology to neighboring islands.
His honourable nature has created tension and conflict with peers and superiors, as Fleet Admiral Sakazuki was stunned and furious with Fujitora over his apology to Riku, and their values as Marines clashed in opposition. Sakazuki, incensed and enraged, believed that Fujitora's actions had caused the Marines' reputation, and Justice by extension, to be shamed, since an Admiral had made an irrefutable declaration that the government failed in its duty. In response, Fujitora lost his composure, disgusted at the idea that admitting fault was shaming Justice. His scathing response to Sakazuki, is one of the few times his normal calm and dispassionate manner is replaced with righteous fury and anger.
While just and honorable, Fujitora has himself admitted a need for pragmatic action, and has aligned himself with parties he opposes on multiple occasions for the sake of protecting the innocent. Pragmatism drove many of his actions during his time in Dressrosa; at first, despite his opposition to the Seven Warlords system and suspicion over Doflamingo's activities, Fujitora agreed to aid the Warlord in opposing the Straw Hat Pirates for the sake of protecting Dressrosa's populace.
However, he later changed his mind after Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his "Birdcage", as he believed that the Straw Hats stood the best chance of saving Dressrosa as well as showing the failure of the Seven Warlords system.
In both instances, he made clear that he would pursue the downfall of both the Donquixote and Straw Hat Pirates after the necessity of working with them came to an end.
Additionally, Fujitora will uphold the letter of the law for the World Government, even if he does not care for it, such as letting
Caesar Clown
go free due to being the subordinate of a Warlord.
While he will obey his superiors' command in most instances, Fujitora has been known to exploit loopholes as he sees fit, such as when he went to
Mary Geoise
while being banned from going to Marine bases and invoking the loophole when notified of Sakazuki's disapproval.
Fujitora prioritising freedom over his duty as an Admiral.
Just as he does not hesitate to pinpoint and work against evil deeds in the Marines and World Government, Fujitora also has no issue with acknowledging good deeds done by pirates and other criminals. He has been blunt with stating that the World Government was to blame for Doflamingo's atrocities whereas Luffy, a pirate, was the hero of Dressrosa. When the Dressrosa citizens got in the way of his pursuit of the Straw Hats, Fujitora recognized the honesty and good intentions of Luffy towards the civilians.
In fact, Luffy's attitude and actions amused and interested Fujitora so much he felt regret blinding himself, as he wondered what Luffy might look like; he even thanked the pirate for saving Dressrosa.
A few days earlier, when Luffy had exposed the Donquixote Pirates' cheating at roulette against Fujitora, the Admiral was appreciative of his kind deed and declined to exchange introductions so that he might remain ignorant of who helped him should their positions result in conflict.
Luffy is also one of the few people known to make Fujitora laugh. In addition, Fujitora may choose to not relentlessly pursue people who are considered enemies of the Marines if they do not pose a threat to innocents, especially if doing so would threaten further lives around them, or if there are more pressing matters at hand.
Notably, he permitted the
Revolutionary Army
to escape Mary Geoise with liberated slaves, preferring to spare them from their horrible fate under the
World Nobles
than fulfil his duty to the World Government.
Despite his desire to prevent collateral damage, Fujitora has been shown to use tremendous displays of force against opponents, attempting to demoralize and terrify foes at the start of battles and gauge their strength at the same time. While confronting
Trafalgar Law
alongside Doflamingo, Fujitora immediately started the fight by summoning a large meteor to strike their location, saying it was only a "little test".
When Doflamingo's thugs tried attacking him and Luffy after their swindling was exposed, Fujitora immediately chose to send them to "hell" and slam them deep into the ground with his gravity.
However, Fujitora's displays of force can at times be reckless beyond belief, as best shown when he summoned another meteor during his fight with
Sabo
only to have it sliced apart by Doflamingo's "Birdcage" and destroy more of the surrounding area than he intended.
Additionally, his attempt to summon a meteor against the Straw Hats on the
Thousand Sunny
whilst also piloting a battleship through the air led to the meteor being redirected and striking his ship. However, even when he encounters a bad situation, Fujitora has been shown keeping his calm, at worst only getting flustered. In the aforementioned battleship attack, Fujitora was shown sitting calmly and eating noodles even when the crew's counterattack put the rest of his subordinates in a panic,
and he remained calm throughout Doflamingo's Birdcage game despite the mass hysteria inflicted, even putting his trust in others to resolve the great problem without hesitation.
Fujitora loves to gamble and play casino games, having been shown playing roulette in his first appearance and making big wagers including going all-in in the last round he played.
In fact, his obsession with gambling is at such a point that he has been shown to treat life the same way as a game of chance, having made allusions to betting and rolling dice when speaking of the conflict in Dressrosa and showing a great reverence for the forces of fate. Most notably, he treated his trust in the Straw Hat Pirates to take down Doflamingo as simply another one of his bets, though with the stakes now being life or death rather than monetary.
Later, when faced with the choice of whether or not to follow his orders to go after the Straw Hats and Law, a choice with merits on each side, Fujitora decided to make this decision by rolling a die and assigning an outcome based on where it landed. When the die's outcome had him leave Luffy alone for two consecutive days despite the low odds, Fujitora stated that something was certainly on the pirate's side.
Fujitora laughs at Luffy's absurd behavior in battle.
Fujitora acts as a humble and quiet man in conversation, as shown when he downplayed Doflamingo's words of praise for his abilities when the two of them first met.
Additionally, despite his great status, his casual mannerisms are no different than a normal older blind man, and many of the people who saw him at Dressrosa did not know who he was.
However, during combat he is shown to take pride in his status as a Marine Admiral and his reputation as a "monster", hating it when people take pity on him due to his blindness. When Luffy informed him of the attacks he would perform ahead of time during their battle and explained that it was out of respect for the admiral's character, Fujitora briefly lost composure and started laughing, though also expressed disappointment at the pirate's illogical behavior.
Fujitora is also prideful when it comes to upholding his morals, as he refused to apologize to Sakazuki for his actions following the Dressrosa conflict even though
Sengoku
said such an apology would likely be enough to get his punishment lifted.
Although aware of the great evil in the world, Fujitora has shown himself to be quite trusting and thus will typically accept anyone's answer to events he is unsure of due to his blindness.
This was best shown when he was willing to believe Doflamingo's thugs when they told him where the roulette ball landed, allowing them to nearly swindle him out of all his money. However, if tipped off that he is being tricked, he will respond with terrifying force upon those who trick him.
Fujitora's willingness to give people the benefit of the doubt even extends to his interactions with pirates, as he gave Law the opportunity to inform him that the Straw Hats were his subordinates, despite those around him knowing that that was not the case. Additionally, although he brought up the suspicions, he had regarding Doflamingo committing illegal activities in secret, Fujitora had no intention of pressing the Warlord over it before investigating further.
Relationships
[
]
Marines
[
]
As an Admiral of the Marines, Fujitora is deeply respected within the organization. He has compassion for his subordinates, and many Marines, including Vice Admirals
Bastille
and
Maynard
, hold strong respect for Fujitora. When several Marines fell under the control of Doflamingo's Parasite technique, Fujitora opted to use his gravity powers to restrain them, rather than using lethal force to stop them. Fujitora prostrating before King Riku to apologize for the World Government's irresponsibility prompted his Marines to follow suit, which was a strong contrast to Sakazuki's concern about the Marines' dignity.
Sakazuki
[
]
He seems to be trusted by Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
, who sent him to deal with the Straw Hat Pirates' and Heart Pirates' alliance, with the two captains of the groups being a notorious pirate and a member of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
respectively. Sakazuki even apologized to Fujitora when he informed him about
Donquixote Doflamingo
's false resignation from the Seven Warlords of the Sea.
However, Sakazuki became furious when Fujitora admitted that the Straw Hat Pirates defeated Doflamingo and apologized on his knees on behalf of the Marines in full view of the world. He demanded that Fujitora do his job to kill Luffy and Law, threatening to make sure no Marine base would allow him in until the task was done. Fujitora, who was disgusted at the actions of the Marines until now—including but not limited to the World Government attempting to give credit to the Marines for
Crocodile
's defeat and turning a blind eye to Doflamingo's actions in Dressrosa–told Sakazuki that he was honored to fulfill his orders.
Fujitora refuses to apologize to Sakazuki for their heated argument out of a deep sense of honor, despite
Sengoku
suggesting that it would make Sakazuki forgive him.
Given Luffy's new position of
Emperor
, it is unknown if Sakazuki's initial demand, of Fujitora arresting Luffy and Law, still stands.
In spite of their tense standing, Sakazuki does trust Fujitora enough to keep him updated on current events such as the dissolution of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
system and the alliance between
Kaidou
and
Big Mom
. Fujitora even gave assurance that the new
SSG
will balance things out.
Smoker
[
]
Smoker talks to Issho about the problems with the Seven Warlords of the Sea system.
Fujitora also seems to be close to
Smoker
, who also shares his belief that the Seven Warlords of the Sea system should be abolished. Smoker and
Tashigi
praised Fujitora for not allowing the incident with Doflamingo in Dressrosa to be covered up like it was with
Crocodile
in
Arabasta
.
Sengoku
[
]
Fujitora and Sengoku seem to be amicable towards each other. Sengoku reveals he knows Fujitora purposely allowed Luffy and Law to escape and defeated the pirates menacing them. He chooses not to report it and notes Sakazuki would forgive him if he apologized. He respects Fujitora's refusal to heed his advice and seems to be amused when the Admiral goes to
Mary Geoise
despite Sakazuki's outrage.
Aramaki
[
]
Fujitora and
Aramaki
appear to be on good terms as Ryokugyu disregarded Sakazuki's orders to drive Fujitora out of Mary Geoise and instead had a friendly conversation with his fellow admiral despite not sharing at all the same vision of justice, for Ryokugyu does see the World Nobles as gods, and is more than willing to do whatever it takes to complete his mission, in vain similar to Sakazuki. During the Levely, however, Ryokugyu became annoyed with Fujitora when he tried to summon a meteor in the Holy Land, which would have endangered everyone present, particularly the World Nobles. When he ends up helping several slaves escape with the Revolutionary Army, Ryokugyu turns on him and they start fighting.
World Government
[
]
Despite technically being a servant of the government, Fujitora despises the World Government and their actions beyond words. This was made apparent during Doflamingo's Birdcage game, as Fujitora noted how the government continues to ignore the citizen's cries when they are truly in trouble and that even if he, a Marine Admiral, arrests Doflamingo, then the government could cover the ordeal as they did in
Arabasta
.
Not wanting them to cover it up like before, Fujitora humiliated the government by bowing before
Riku Doldo III
and giving a heartfelt apology on their behalf, heading off the lies before the nobility could act. This action infuriated the
Five Elders
, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, putting Fujitora's title and reputation as admiral in jeopardy.
Fujitora also showed indirect defiance against the
World Nobles
by letting the slaves escape during the Revolutionary Army's invasion on
Mary Geoise
when Fujitora is not truly loyal towards Celestial Dragons.
Enemies
[
]
Seven Warlords of the Sea
[
]
Despite the fact that the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
were on the World Government's side, Fujitora (much like Smoker) believed that the Seven Warlords of the Sea were nothing more than pirates who could not be trusted and aimed to abolish the Seven Warlords of the Sea's system,
which came into fruition after colluding with kings
Riku Doldo III
of
Dressrosa
and
Nefertari Cobra
of
Arabasta
.
It is unknown if he has had interactions with any other former Warlords other than Doflamingo in his capacity as an Admiral, or prior to joining the Marines.
After the dissolution of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Fujitora seemed pleased to learn this.
Pirates
[
]
As a Marine, he views pirates as enemies, although he is more flexible than most Marines and is able to look past them and see their good qualities. He was willing to acknowledge Luffy's character for his help with the swindlers and felt obligated to fight him because he considered it "biting the hand that feeds him". However, he puts the civilians' safety above the pirates' arrest. When he realized that he was being cheated by some of Doflamingo's underlings, he quickly took care of them.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Luffy faces Fujitora as he tries to reach Doflamingo.
Despite being enemies,
Luffy
helped Fujitora when Doflamingo's thugs were cheating due to his blindness, and he even thanked Luffy for his kindness. However, during Doflamingo's Birdcage game, Fujitora was going to hinder Luffy and his allies from reaching Doflamingo, but he was stopped by Sabo. He then allowed Luffy to defeat Doflamingo. During the Straw Hat Pirates and allies' escape, Fujitora fought against Luffy until they escaped, to which he was taken aback by the latter admitting that he likes him. When Fujitora attempted to drop the rubble on Luffy, he was stopped by the cheering citizens of Dressrosa and decided to let Luffy go. Seeing how the citizens tried to help Luffy, Fujitora smiled and admitted that he should not have blinded himself because he wanted to see what Luffy's face looks like. When Doflamingo's business associates attempted to kill Luffy, Fujitora dropped the rubble on the enemy fleet as a farewell gift for Luffy and thanked him for cleaning up the World Government's mess. Luffy remains one of the few people in the series so far who has made him laugh.
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
Despite having been sent to help him, Fujitora was mistrustful of
Doflamingo
as soon as he met him, having heard rumors of Doflamingo's illegal activities which contributed to his desire to end the Seven Warlords of the Sea system. He made it clear to Doflamingo that he was helping him in order to protect Dressrosa, namely its citizens, from Luffy and Law rather than out of a desire to help the Warlord of the Sea himself. When he and Doflamingo confronted Law, Fujitora showed little regard for Doflamingo when he called down a meteor onto the scene, and he openly talked about Doflamingo's suspicious activities and his own desire to end the Seven Warlords of the Sea system, which annoyed the Warlord of the Sea and even caused him to attack the admiral once. Although Fujitora is an admiral, Doflamingo acted cocky around him, expecting Fujitora to help him against Luffy and Law no matter the situation and even believing that he could dispose of the admiral once he trapped everyone in the Birdcage. When Doflamingo's illegal activities were eventually put on full display, Fujitora did not go after the Warlord of the Sea, as he did not want the World Government to fix a problem that they themselves had created. He went after Doflamingo's enemies for a brief period of time during this, but later stopped going after Luffy and Law and bet on them to stop Doflamingo. Once Doflamingo was defeated, Fujitora had the Warlord of the Sea arrested immediately. For refusing to assist him against both Luffy and Law, Doflamingo called Fujitora as an "idiot".
Revolutionaries
[
]
Due to being an officer in the Marines, he is an enemy of the
Revolutionary Army
. As such, he and his battalion engaged Sabo when he impeded their capture of Luffy. He personally clashed with Dragon's second-in-command. Despite this opposition, he confesses to
Sabo
it is not possible for the Marines to stop Doflamingo, and leaves the Heavenly Demon's defeat to the pirates. When speaking to Sabo about Luffy being his brother, Fujitora paused for a moment when Sabo mentioned how he never wanted to let another one of his brothers die again then responding in a respectful manner showing consideration toward the young man's pain and desire to protect those closest to him. However, they later have another confrontation at the
Levely
when Sabo and his comrades attempted to rescue
Bartholomew Kuma
from his enslavement by the
World Nobles
.
However, when the Revolutionaries rescued many slaves, Fujitora permitted them to escape.
Other
[
]
Riku Doldo III
[
]
Fujitora has great respect for
King Riku
and made the same bet as him. After Doflamingo's defeat, Fujitora told him not to take responsibility and bowed down towards him to apologize for the World Government allowing a
vicious pirate
to become one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and take over Dressrosa. Riku asked Fujitora to raise his head until he found out the reason Fujitora couldn't attack Doflamingo at the palace. Fujitora claimed this is not the Marines' victory. They apparently have maintained cordial relations as Fujitora requested to have a private conversation with him before the
Levely
commences.
Nefertari Cobra
[
]
Fujitora has great respect for
King Cobra
due to him sending a secret letter requesting a private conversation between him,
Riku Doldo III
of Dressrosa and the Admiral himself.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As an
Admiral
, Fujitora has command over the thousands of Marines ranked beneath him, his status being just below the
Fleet Admiral
's. Among other things, he holds the authority to call out
battleships
however he sees fit and to initiate a
Buster Call
on any island he deems a threat, as well as pass on to lower ranking
government agents
the same privilege.
Being the former military chief of Aoi, Issho once held full authority over the kingdom's army before its destruction, meaning he has prior experience as a commanding officer before the World Military Draft.
Combat-wise, Fujitora (along with his fellow admirals) is thought to constitute the
World Government
's "Greatest Military Force",
making him one of the world's most powerful people. As noted by
Doflamingo
and himself, Fujitora and
Ryokugyu
are known as "powerful monsters" in the Marines.
Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
had confidence in Fujitora's ability to deal with
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Trafalgar Law
, both members of the
Worst Generation
and the latter (at the time) a
Warlord of the Sea
.
From just a brief display of his powers, Fujitora earned the prompt admiration of Luffy, who could easily ascertain his strength.
Yet another such display sufficed to intimidate Law and even the normally unshakable Doflamingo.
Greatly attesting to his power, Fujitora was able to fight
Sabo
—the
Revolutionary Army
's chief of staff and "No. 2" in strength, who had not long beforehand acquired a
powerful Logia ability
—to more or less a standstill, emerging from such fight without a scratch. By Sabo's own reckoning, Fujitora had not gone all out but merely stalled for time, due to not seeing his then-foe as a true enemy.
Additionally, with the presumed assistance of other powerful Marines (particularly
Sengoku
and
Tsuru
), Fujitora was able to hand a crushing defeat to
Jack
, a top commander of one of the
Four Emperors
with a bounty of
1,000,000,000, in a naval battle.
Issho prepares to strike despite his blindness.
Despite being blind, Fujitora can handle himself in combat against some of the most powerful figures in the world, due to his other acute senses and
Observation Haki
.
Many who face him are shocked by his power, with Law noting that blindness is no hinderance to Fujitora's actions or abilities.
He has excellent hearing, having heard
Nami
's
lightning
from kilometers away when neither Doflamingo nor Law next to him did. He also stated that he is able to sense the movement of clouds.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Fujitora's physical strength and fortitude are immense, befitting an admiral. He was able to defend against and repel powerful attacks from the likes of
Roronoa Zoro
, Sabo, and Luffy as well as clash with them (including the latter when using
Gear 2
and
Gear 3
) with little to no visible effort.
He could also withstand a kick from Doflamingo without issue using his sword.
Incredibly resilient, Fujitora could guard against a
Haki
-imbued Gear 3 punch from Luffy without using his own Haki while remaining unhurt by the blow.
Fujitora has extraordinary reflexes and, coupled with his skill in Observation Haki, can casually and precisely counter very swift and unexpected physical threats.
For example, he can time his defense against a self-summoned, meteorite falling at inhuman speed that with such precision, he can deflect a piece of it like pushing aside a piece of paper,
and warded off an unexpected "flying slash" from Zoro without a flinch or scratch.
When Doflamingo surprise-attacked him with a kick, the admiral showed no concern whilst blocking it.
The admiral's own movement speed is likewise impressive, as he could lunge forward to strike Luffy in their fight, being too quick for the pirate to react.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Fujitora uses his sword and Devil Fruit powers to create a massive hole.
Fujitora possesses tremendous swordsmanship skills, which he combines with his
Devil Fruit
ability, channeling his gravity powers through his sword.
Usually, Fujitora wields his weapon in a reverse-grip style, the blade pointing in the direction opposite to his thumb. Despite his blindness, the admiral has shown to be extremely skilled with his blade, able to deflect or block incoming attacks, even extremely strong ones or surprise attacks, with little issue using simple parrying maneuvers, demonstrating lightning-fast dexterity all the while. Fujitora's swordsmanship, combined with his Devil Fruit powers, allowed him to repeatedly and evenly clash with Sabo wielding his
flame-shrouded
staff and exhibit no trouble in doing so.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Zushi Zushi no Mi
Fujitora uses his power to lift rubble.
Fujitora ate the Zushi Zushi no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to manipulate gravitational forces. The ability's range of effect can potentially span wide areas, even
entire islands
,
and is primarily channeled through the admiral's sword.
Fujitora can drastically increase the gravity around others, keeping them on the ground and making it difficult for them to move,
including extremely strong adversaries. He can increase the gravity acting on opponents to press them down under immense pressure, even going as far as to create large craters deep into the ground.
Fujitora can also control the direction of his gravity, allowing him to generate "horizontal" gravity to attack with a tremendous outward force.
Moreover, the admiral is able to employ his power defensively by making fields of seemingly reverse gravity to repel attacks.
He can also use the gravity to pull objects directly toward himself, with the field of gravity being capable of reaching (possibly) into outer space, which Fujitora has used multiple times to summon meteorites to strike his opponents.
By negating gravity entirely, Fujitora can enact the controlled levitation of nonliving objects around him. He has been shown levitating a battleship to move himself and his men more quickly over the sea,
as well as floating a small rock to use as a personal mobile platform to stand and ride around on, achieving effective flight.
Haki

Fujitora is a highly skilled user of
Armament Haki
, being able to clash head-on with
Sabo
, a
Logia
user who himself is proficient with this Haki.
Fujitora can focus a strong concentration of Haki into his sword, rendering it obsidian-black and strong enough to defend against the razor-sharp string bars of Doflamingo's
Torikago
, which can easily slice up cannonballs and stone buildings.
Observation Haki
[
]
Fujitora seeing the world through Observation Haki.
Fujitora possesses masterful skill in
Observation Haki
, which he uses to compensate for his blindness in battle, and his incredible skill gives him a strong sense of danger. He can accurately predict fast (and surprise) attacks from enemies, like an unexpected kick from Doflamingo, and generally handle combat against extremely strong, fast, and agile enemies without apparent difficulty.
Most notably, Fujitora is capable of perceiving living beings around him as images in his "mind's eye" (represented as colored, person-shaped auras on a dark background), in a way unimpaired by his blindness. Additionally, Fujitora has demonstrated the ability to read and hear the true thoughts and emotions of other people, which made him aware, for example, that the Dressrosa citizenry bore no ill will towards Luffy while "chasing" him out of their country.
Weapons

As a blind man, when he is not using his sword in battle, Fujitora prefers to use it as a walking cane.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Issho was born somewhere in the
Grand Line
54 years ago.
At some point, he became the military chief of the
Aoi Kingdom
, serving in the position until the kingdom was destroyed by a war, during which he became a significant war criminal.
Possibly during this time, he blinded himself after seeing too many evil atrocities.
Eventually, he traveled to
Soja Island
, where he incurred severe losses in a gambling house and was made to work as a bodyguard. Issho's strength caught the attention of the
World Government
, who bought the place he was working on for a large sum of money and drafted him into the
Marines
as part of their "World Military Draft", seemingly aware of his past as the military chief of the Aoi Kingdom.
After being drafted, Issho was immediately promoted to fill one of the two vacant
Admiral
positions shortly after joining, alongside fellow newcomer
Aramaki
, and was assigned the alias "Fujitora".
Fujitora promptly decided to use his new position to campaign for the abolishment of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
system,
at one point talking with
Smoker
and learning how if it were not for the
Straw Hat Pirates
, the
Arabasta Kingdom
would have been taken over by the Warlord
Crocodile
.

Issho defeats Doflamingo's men with
Gravito
.
Following news breaking out that the Warlord
Trafalgar Law
and pirate
Monkey D. Luffy
formed an alliance and
Donquixote Doflamingo
resigned from the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Fujitora was dispatched to Doflamingo's kingdom of
Dressrosa
by Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
to investigate the affair.
Upon arriving at Dressrosa, Fujitora went to a restaurant and played roulette with some men who worked under Doflamingo. The pirates took advantage of the admiral's blindness and lied that the ball was not landing on the colors that he bet on each round, even though Fujitora was right every time. Fujitora was about to go all-in when Luffy intervened and informed him of the Donquixote Family's deception. The goons tried attacking Luffy, and in response Fujitora used his Devil Fruit powers to slam them into the ground and send them plummeting into a giant crater.
Fujitora then gave the proprietor a note telling him where he could send a bill for repairs as he headed out, and when Luffy asked him who he was, the Admiral replied that it was best for both of them that he not reveal it.
Later, Fujitora attended the gladiator matches at the
Corrida Colosseum
. At the end of the Block A battle, he decided to head off to
Green Bit
and ordered for three battleships to arrive to deal with the numerous criminals competing in the Colosseum as well as extra medics to help treat any spectators injured by the fighting.
Fujitora vs. Law vs. Doflamingo.
Fujitora flew a battleship to Green Bit and was heading to the southeast coast on foot when he received a call from Sakazuki revealing that Doflamingo had actually never quit the Seven Warlords, a development that even he was unaware of.
Fujitora and his troops arrived at the coast at the same time as Doflamingo and confronted Trafalgar Law, who had
Caesar Clown
in his possession. Fujitora said that Caesar was exonerated due to being Doflamingo's subordinate but noted he had heard rumors of suspicious activities being committed by the Warlord. He then asked Law if the Straw Hats were his subordinates; Law replied that he had in fact entered in an alliance with the crew, causing Fujitora to revoke his Warlord status and attack the pirate by summoning a giant meteor from space. Law, Doflamingo, and Fujitora himself were caught in the meteor's path, and each of them used their abilities to repel part of it, ultimately ending up standing on small ground formations surrounded by a giant crater.
Fujitora and Doflamingo then worked in tandem to attack Law and they eventually defeated him.
Fujitora held his sword over Law to bind him with gravity, but when Doflamingo tried squeezing the disembodied heart he took from Law that he thought was Caesar's, one of Fujitora's men cried out in pain instead. Law then used his
Devil Fruit ability
to create a "ROOM" and switch himself with a rock, allowing him to run away. While Doflamingo chased after Law, Fujitora returned to the battleship he had used to get to Green Bit and piloted it through the air to attack the
Straw Hat Pirates
that had just arrived on the
Thousand Sunny
. However, when he summoned a meteor to attack the ship, Law redirected it to damage his battleship instead. Fujitora then decided to head back to Dressrosa, having a feeling that the battle would soon take a turn.
Fujitora intercepts Zoro's attack against Doflamingo.
Upon arriving at Dressrosa, Fujitora was informed of a big fight going on in the town and arrived there to find Doflamingo shooting Law and rendering him unconscious.
Roronoa Zoro
and
Kin'emon
then tried to attack Doflamingo, but Fujitora swooped in and blocked Zoro's sword strike. He proceeded to force Zoro down a hole, but still had to counter a flying slash unleashed by the swordsman from there. Fujitora then lifted a piece of the ground he was standing on and rose into the air alongside Doflamingo as the Warlord prepared to leave the area, and Doflamingo told the Admiral to talk with him at his palace.
The duo went to Doflamingo's throne room, and the Warlord received an alert that
Franky
of the Straw Hats was attacking the Toy House.
Fujitora had Vice Admiral
Bastille
take his troops to confront the pirate, telling Doflamingo that he did this to protect his subjects rather than him. He then revealed to Doflamingo his intention of abolishing the Seven Warlords, causing the two of them to briefly clash. However, the tension then cooled as the Admiral said he would turn a blind eye to the Warlord's suspicious behavior for the time being.
Fujitora then went down to the Toy House after Bastille's troops had helped defeat Franky. Right then, however, the
toys
that had populated Dressrosa were suddenly turned into humans, exposing Doflamingo's tyrannical control over Dressrosa's citizens. Doflamingo then surrounded the whole island in a "Birdcage" made out of strings, which rendered everyone within unable to escape and also cut off communication to the outside world. He then used his "Parasite" technique to take control of random people in Dressrosa and force them to commit uncontrolled violence, and Fujitora used his gravity to subdue the Marines impacted by this attack. Bastille asked if they would be going after Doflamingo, but Fujitora said they would remain pursuing Luffy and Law while working to subdue those under Doflamingo's control.
When Vice Admiral
Maynard
emerged from underneath the Colosseum he too asked why Fujitora was against arresting Doflamingo, and the admiral replied that the World Government should not play God and put an end to suffering that they had created. Luffy, Zoro, and Law then came crashing down from the King's Plateau, and Fujitora stepped up to confront the pirates himself, proceeding to clash again with Zoro.
However, Doflamingo's executive officer
Pica
then formed and inhabited a
giant stone golem
which he used to attack Luffy, and Fujitora was forced to move away from Pica's powerful attack and became separated from the three pirates.
Fujitora and Sabo clash.
Fujitora and his troops tried heading after Luffy and Law but were quickly stopped by
Sabo
, the chief of staff of the
Revolutionary Army
.
As Sabo attacked the grunt soldiers and Bastille, Fujitora brought a meteor down. However, the meteor was cut into pieces by the Birdcage, causing it to destroy more of the town than intended, and a sheepish Fujitora was left hoping that no one was harmed. Sabo then confronted him after having beaten Bastille, revealing he was standing in the Marines' way of Luffy because the two of them were sworn brothers. The two of them then clashed, with their powerful attacks resulting in heavy collateral damage.
At one point in the fight, Fujitora attacked Sabo with a blast of sideways gravity while brushing off the Revolutionary's questioning of his motives.
However, Fujitora later put an end to the fighting, revealing that his and Sabo's goals were aligned but that it was not the Marines' place to be the hero of this country. Fujitora then went to the old King's Plateau, where a crowd of Dressrosa citizens laid prostrate before the country's previous king
Riku Doldo III
as he expressed confidence in Luffy being able to save them from Doflamingo. Fujitora told the former king that he had placed the same bet, leaving it up to the Straw Hats and their allies to be the country's heroes.
Later, Fujitora left the plateau and reunited with his troops, telling them to gather up the civilians in one place so they could be kept safe.
When Zoro cut apart Pica's stone golem above the plateau, Fujitora used his ability to keep the pieces from crashing onto the citizens and move them to a safe area.
Later, Doflamingo began constricting the Birdcage, and the pirates and civilians began an attempt to stop it in order to give Luffy enough time to defeat the Warlord. Fujitora approached part of the Birdcage near where Zoro, Kin'emon, and
Kanjuro
were and joined in their effort, using his Haki-imbued sword to clash against the strings.
Fujitora's bet would come to fruition as Luffy successfully defeated Doflamingo before the Birdcage fully closed, causing the contraption to disappear.
Fujitora and the Marines kneel in apology.
Fujitora had his subordinates arrest Doflamingo and his crew but told them not to report to
Marine Headquarters
yet. He had one of his men film him with a Den Den Mushi as he approached King Riku, and upon reaching the former king, he declared that the World Government was responsible for allowing Doflamingo to reign in tyranny. He then apologized on behalf of the World Government as he and his men prostrated themselves before Doldo, which was broadcast through the Den Den Mushi to neighboring islands as Fujitora intended.
He later received a call from Sakazuki reprimanding him for not contacting Headquarters before doing such a thing and responded that they would have had the news tell a different story. Sakazuki argued for the benefit of covering things up in order to maintain the Marines' reputation as a just and capable organization, but Fujitora, disgusted with Sakazuki's perspective, retorted in fury that such a reputation would be a worse disgrace, refusing to give ground to Sakazuki despite his status as Fleet Admiral. Sakazuki, shaking in his anger, then told Fujitora that he would not be allowed on any Marine base until he had captured Luffy and Law, and the Admiral accepted this without complaint.
Luffy punches Fujitora.
When night fell, Fujitora rolled a die to see if he should go after Luffy and Law or not. The die came up showing 1, the lone number that would leave the pirates safe for that day.
Fujitora rolled a 1 on the next day as well, and the day after, he was greeted by Inspector General
Sengoku
and Vice Admiral
Tsuru
who had arrived at Dressrosa. Fujitora told them what he was doing and gave Tsuru the opportunity to roll the die for that day. Tsuru rolled a 6, causing Fujitora to immediately send his forces after the pirates.
Fujitora flew toward the entrance to the eastern port to confront the pirates, and
Bartolomeo
created a
barrier
to try and stop him. Fujitora responded by lifting all of the rubble in the country into the sky to use it against the pirates; however, when Luffy came running toward the eastern port, he attacked Fujitora with a desire to fight and defeat the admiral head-on.
The two of them furiously traded blows, but Luffy strangely called out what attacks he would perform in advance. Fujitora confronted him over this, feeling insulted at being treated with pity. Luffy responded that he wanted to give the admiral a fair shot due to not viewing him as a bad person, and this briefly caused Fujitora to break out into laughter. However, he still expressed disappointment and used his fruit power to blast the pirate into the cliff. Luffy was then taken to the port to escape with his comrades, and Fujitora prepared to annihilate them with the floating rubble. However, the Dressrosa citizens then came running toward the port, claiming to the admiral that they wanted to stop the pirates themselves. However, Fujitora could tell from their emotions and whispers that the citizens actually supported the pirates and wanted to save them. He was left impressed by how Luffy had gained the people's respect and lamented his blindness preventing him from seeing what Luffy looked like.
Soon afterwards, the Straw Hats' group came under attack by another pirate alliance, but Fujitora then dropped the rubble on their ships while intentionally missing the ships of the Straw Hats' group. Being at peace with this turn of events but hoping to keep it under wraps, Fujitora vocally thanked the Straw Hats for what they had done, but was left aghast after Sengoku revealed that he heard him.
Soon afterward, Fujitora, Sengoku, Tsuru, and their forces set sail on a convoy of battleships to escort Doflamingo to
Impel Down
. Fujitora said he would wander after finishing the escort and Sengoku said he could likely get out of his punishment by just apologizing to Sakazuki, but Fujitora replied that his pride would not allow it.
Not long afterwards, Fujitora's Marine fleet came under attack by
Jack
of the
Beasts Pirates
in an attempt to rescue Doflamingo; they eventually defeated the pirate and held onto Doflamingo, though lost two ships in the process.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, before he went to the restaurant, he had a brief conversation with Zoro. Zoro seemed intimidated by him and was about to unsheathe his sword, but then calmed down after Fujitora walked past him.
In the anime, Fujitora wins 15 times in the game of roulette before he eventually "loses" to Doflamingo's thugs, with others betting on his calls to also make money. In the manga, it only shows him "losing" to the thugs.
In the anime, Fujitora slashed Doflamingo's thugs with his sword before creating the hole. He slashed all of them, though it appeared to have no effect, but after he sheathed his sword, the gravity started to take effect. In the manga, Fujitora did not slash them with his sword, but merely sheathed his sword to make the hole.
In the anime, after leaving
Corrida Colosseum
, Fujitora uses his Devil Fruit ability to retrieve a lost balloon for a young girl.
When confronting Luffy and Zoro during Doflamingo's Birdcage game, the manga only showed him clashing swords with Zoro. In the anime, Luffy tries to attack Fujitora first.
