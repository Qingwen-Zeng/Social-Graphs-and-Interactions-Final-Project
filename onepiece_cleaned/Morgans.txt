For the former Marine captain, see
Morgan
.
"Big News" Morgans
is the president of the
World Economy News Paper
and one of the emperors of the
Underworld
.
His first appearance was during the
Whole Cake Island Arc
, as one of the more high-profile guests in
Big Mom's
Tea Party
. Since then, Morgans has been a frequent figure in the
world
's ongoings, usually by being the first to report on them to the general public.
Appearance
[
]
In his Human-Beast form courtesy of his Devil Fruit, Morgans has the form of a very tall human albatross hybrid with small eyes and a large beak. His body is covered in white feathers, and he has a large tail and wings that resemble human arms. He wears a blue top hat with a large striped feather in it, a light blue button-down shirt with a yellow bow on the top, red and white checkered pants, a dark cape, and shoes that fit his bird-like feet.
As of yet, his Human and Beast forms have not been shown.
Personality
[
]
Morgans gets excited by major events, looking forward to reporting them as news to the world. He tends to exclaim "Big News!" when witnessing a newsworthy event.
This trait is the reason for his epithet. In fact, whenever a big scoop would pop up, he would retain his calm and composure just to get it, despite the chaos and danger the opportunity presents.
As the President of the World Economy News Paper, Morgans takes utmost pride in his occupation as a journalist and does not tolerate being called otherwise.
He is even willing to risk his life on occasion just to take pictures of a newsworthy event.
He is not even afraid of incurring an Emperor's wrath upon himself, as seen when he intentionally wrote an article of Big Mom's defeat, knowing full well what consequences that action could do to him.
While claiming that he has deep connections with the Germa, he showed no caring concerns for their well-being, as when the
Big Mom Pirates
revealed their treacherous plot to obliterate Germa's
ruling family
, Morgans simply found the turn of events to be exciting.
He has proven to be an unscrupulous individual, as when Big Mom was dealing with her enemies, Morgans tried to peek into the contents of the
Tamatebako
and was caught eavesdropping on the events with Lu Feld and Stussy. He agreed to create a fake story to cover Stussy's tracks in exchange for seeing the famous sea treasure.
He can also be prone to letting his personal biases influence his news stories, as his respect and admiration for
Luffy
caused him to exaggerate the pirate's accomplishments against Big Mom.
Morgans is shown to not care whether anything he publishes in the newspaper is true or not and considers the newspaper a form of entertainment.
Morgans has a soft spot for beautiful women, as he was completely captivated by Shirahoshi.
This may apply to Vivi as well, as despite the extremely dangerous situation that unfolded at the
Levely
, Morgans took her in to hide her from the World Government.
Morgans has demonstrated impartiality and a commitment to pursuing captivating news stories, regardless of their origin. This was evident when he chose to take in Wapol and Vivi, not out of concern, but just because he was sorely interested in the fact why the two are seeking asylum. Whether he did this out of the goodness of his heart or for his own personal gain, or some mixture of both, remains to be seen. Occasionally, Morgans may incorporate false information and fabrications into his articles to enhance reader engagement.
He has a
distinct laugh
: "Kuwahahaha".
Relationships
[
]
Germa 66
[
]
Morgans had a deep connection to
Germa 66
and made them the main antagonists of his comic
Sora, Warrior of the Sea
. However, when the Big Mom Pirates revealed their treachery toward the
Vinsmoke Family
, Morgans had no concern for them and was excited at this turn of events.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Morgans has shown a strong interest in Luffy due to his reputation as a member of the
Worst Generation
and an infamous troublemaker. Morgans was excited to highlight Luffy's troubles during the Tea Party.
After the incident in Totto Land, Morgans declared Luffy as the "Fifth Emperor" throughout the world.
He found Luffy's
awakened form
to be mystifying and used it as his updated photo for his bounty poster, while ignoring the Government's orders to remove the "
D.
" from the name.
Despite his interest in him, Morgans had no trouble choosing to portray Luffy as the instigator, falsely claiming he had tried to kidnap Dr.
Vegapunk
when he learned he had been on Egghead Island, simply to be rewarded handsomely by the World Government.
He became shocked that Luffy had taken
York
, one of Vegapunk's Satellites, hostage against the
Five Elders
the next morning, making his fake article true to a certain extent.
Stussy
[
]
Morgans and
Stussy
have apparently helped each other several times in the past. As both hold privileged positions for information gathering, the two have been exchanging precious intel for some time, so that Morgans can obtain exclusive scoops while Stussy gets access to all of the World Economy paper's reports. Morgans begrudgingly agreed to cover up her involvement in Big Mom's
Tea Party
and allowed her to take a ride in his balloon in order to sneak away from
Totto Land
.
Enemies
[
]
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Morgans was one of the guests for Big Mom's
Tea Party
.
However, after Morgans spread the news about Big Mom's "defeat" to Luffy, she swore revenge on him.
World Government
[
]
Morgans does not appear to be on good terms with the Government. He refused to accept a bribe from them on not exposing a certain event at the
Levely
. When threatened by a
Cipher Pol
agent (who masqueraded as Attach), he quickly beat up the agent and told his workers to move their headquarters to hide from the government's retaliation.
He continued to defy the Government's orders by using a photo of Luffy's awakened form that was not approved by the
Five Elders
for bounty poster and refused to remove the "D." from the name.
However, he is willing to edit the news about certain incidents that would negatively affect the World Government's reputation, so long as they reward him handsomely for it.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Morgans is in charge of the World Economy News Paper, giving him control over the newspaper and the information it gives to people. He has access to information not available to most people, as demonstrated by his knowledge of

Soul Pocus
technique.
Furthermore, as a boss of the
Underworld
, Morgans has a high degree of power within it. His importance is recognized by
Emperor
Big Mom

Germa
,
and his newspaper incidentally publishes a popular
comic strip
that features their
army
as its main antagonists.

Cipher Pol
agent within seconds.
He also possesses great willpower, withstanding a blast of

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Thirty-eight years ago, a fifteen year old Morgans was already a reporter and wrote the article about the
God Valley Incident
, though he only reported on
Monkey D. Garp
's heroics on the
island
, leaving out the
Native Hunting Competition
.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[

Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Morgans attending Big Mom's tea party.
Morgans received an invitation from
Big Mom
to attend her
Tea Party
, where
Charlotte Pudding
and
Sanji
would be married, and he was happy to have been invited and excited to report the event in the
newspaper
. He and his fellow
Underworld
bosses were escorted by
Charlotte Perospero
into the
Whole Cake Chateau
, where they were taken to the wedding venue by a
candy escalator
. At the venue, Morgans came to
Smoothie
's drink stand before the tea party began.
During the tea party, Morgans spoke with
Vinsmoke Judge
. Later, he presented Big Mom with his present, a rare gift from the south, before asking her about the
Tamatebako
in her possession. He then took part in the festivities as the wedding ceremony began.
When
Streusen
presented the wedding cake, Morgans marveled at it. During the wedding ceremony,
Monkey D. Luffy
emerged from the wedding cake, and Morgans ran away from the explosion.
When
Lu Feld
commented on the chaos, Morgans was excited at Luffy's presence at the wedding. He soon noted that
Big Mom's power
allowed her to take the souls of those afraid of her. Morgans was also thrilled at the thought of reporting
Jinbe
's declaration to leave
Big Mom's crew
to join the
Straw Hat Pirates
. He was amazed to see that Big Mom was unable to take away Jinbe's lifespan due to him having no fear towards Big Mom.
When the Big Mom Pirates revealed their treachery towards the
Vinsmoke Family
, Morgans was excited by this turn of events.
Moments later, Luffy caused Big Mom to start her strange scream and Morgans was immobilized from having to cover his ears.
After Big Mom stopped screaming, Morgans witnessed
Stussy
shoot Lu Feld when the latter was about to open the Tamatebako. Stussy then made sure that Morgans would blame Lu Feld for the theft of the chest. Morgans then requested to see the contents of the chest, which Stussy allowed. However, Lu Feld's unconscious body was leaning on the chest, causing it to fall off the platform it was on. Both Morgans and Stussy watched in shock as the chest dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and exploded.
The explosion caused the Chateau to collapse, and Morgans excitedly snapped pictures, forgetting that he was falling too until Stussy told him and then panicking because of his inability to fly.
Morgans and Stussy meet with Mont-d'Or and Niwatori.
Despite the fall, Morgans survived and was shown unharmed. Hours after the collapse of the Whole Cake Chateau, Morgans and Stussy met with
Count Niwatori
and
Mont-d'Or
. As Stussy was about to reveal that the explosion that toppled the Chateau was caused by the Tamatebako, Morgans pointed out that this revelation would further decrease the Straw Hats' chances for survival, but she went ahead and told them anyway.
As the Straw Hats' promised rendezvous time on
Cacao Island
drew near, Morgans commented that it would be unbelievable news if Luffy overcame the slim odds of escape, but Mont-d'Or promised him that the Big Mom Pirates' forces would crush the Straw Hats.
As the chaos in
Totto Land
further intensified, Morgans and Stussy snuck away from Whole Cake Island.
While he and Stussy were riding in a balloon, Morgans cheered for the Straw Hats to escape before sharing with Stussy his belief that the next Pirate King would come from the
Worst Generation
.
Levely Arc
[
]
After the Straw Hats escaped Totto Land, Morgans wrote an article detailing Luffy's exploits, giving him credit for orchestrating the assassination attempt on Big Mom and declaring him to be the "Fifth Emperor".
He later went to the
Red Port
at the
Red Line
to see the
royals
who would be attending the
Levely
. Upon seeing
Shirahoshi
, Morgans was mesmerized by her beauty. When he saw
Sterry
, Morgans noted that Luffy,
Ace
,
Sabo
, and
Dragon
also came from the
Goa Kingdom
.

Wano Country Arc
[
]
Morgans beats up an agent of the Cipher Pol, refusing to change the headlines of his newspaper.
At the World Economic News headquarters, Morgans was ordering his employees around on how to format the front page scoop.
Attach
alerted Morgans of a letter from the
World Government
, which turned out to be bribe money to keep a certain incident under wraps. Because the incident was such a huge scoop, Morgans ordered Attach to send the money back. At this moment, the
man
that had appeared to be Attach suddenly ripped off his face mask and pointed a gun at Morgans, revealing himself as a
Cipher Pol
agent. However, Morgans knocked out the agent, refusing to back down from any threats because of his pride as a reporter. Worried on how the Cipher Pol infiltrated his organization, he ordered his employees to move their headquarters somewhere safe. Morgans was then told that
Wapol
was in contact, claiming to have some information.
Said information Wapol gave him was that he was running for his life due to witnessing
Nefertari Cobra
's death at the hands of the
Five Elders
and
Imu
, the secret ruler of the world, and in exchange for this information, Morgans offered him asylum from the World Government. He would also end up taking in
Nefertari Vivi
as well to hide her from the World Government.
After the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's
raid on Onigashima
, Morgans received information about the events that transpired but was cut off when the Cipher Pol agents were attacked by the
Big Mom Pirates
. Refusing to cover up such exciting news, Morgans printed the stories and new
bounty posters
without prior approval of the World Government.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
After learning from an unknown source that the World Government was attempting to assassinate
Dr. Vegapunk
, Morgans disparaged their plan because the
scientist
was so beloved around the world. However, in order to please the World Government and earn a monetary reward, Morgans ordered his reporters to write a headline stating that Emperor Luffy had taken
Vegapunk
hostage on
Egghead
and was waging all-out war against the Marines. Vivi was outraged by this false headline, but Morgans retorted that what mattered was entertainment, not truth.
Some time later, Morgans, using a
Black Den Den Mushi
, heard Luffy claim he took
Dr. Vegapunk
hostage and demand all Marine ships on Egghead leave in exchange for York's safety, expressing shock that his false headline turned out true.
Morgans and the WENP caught wind of
Vegapunk's
broadcasted message being signaled across the
World
via Marine comms traffic. Vivi asked if it said anything regarding Luffy and the crew's location, but Morgans explained to her the clock in the broadcast did not match current time on Egghead island, meaning it was recorded prior to the
Buster Call
occurring on the island.
When
Vegapunk's
pre recorded message revealed that it would activate at the time of his heart stopped beating, Morgans grew furious as he would not be able to capitalize on the broadcasted revelations in his own papers.
Vivi then cover Morgan's mouth to listen to the broadcast, which annoys Morgans.
As
Vegapunk
was going to impart a message to the people who bear the
Will of D
, Morgans wondered what was he going to say, but then the broadcast suddenly stopped.
Later, the broadcast suddenly continued to play to Morgans's and Vivi's Shock.
Following the end of the broadcast, Morgans was ecstatic with the new possibilities he had to paint a grim future for his readers. Vivi was disgusted with his plans, and made her opinion known, to his annoyance. He attempted to threaten her with the possibility of handing her and Wapol over to the government, but she remained undeterred. In the end, he was too enthralled by the future news stories to care further, and ranted on just what he could report next.
