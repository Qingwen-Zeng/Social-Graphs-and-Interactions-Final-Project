Hawkman
is a
Gifter
in the
Beasts Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Hawkman is a man of average size. Due to the
SMILE
that he consumed, a large green hawk is present on the back of his body, acting as a sort of hood over his head, and possessing large wings. Unlike other Gifters, he does not possess a pair of horns. He wears a blue-green fur coat over his shoulders, red pants, brown boots, and a belt bearing the symbol of the Beasts Pirates.
Personality
[
]
Like most pirates, Hawkman seems to revel in causing violence and chaos. He had little issue with blowing up various ships and infrastructure on Orochi's orders
, and didn't hesitate to gloat about it when given the chance. He also showed great confidence in Kaidou's abilities, going as far as to completely disregard the Straw Hats and their allies' attempts to overthrow him.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Hawkman seems quite capable of fighting, given his status as a Gifter, as well as his confidence in his own strength. However, when confronted by three members of the worst generation, he was unable to harm any of them.
Devil Fruit

SMILE

Weapons
[
]
Hawkman carries multiple small
bombs
on his person, using them at one point to damage the Thousand Sunny, as well as various other ships and infrastructure around Wano.
In the anime, he also wields
Steil Grenades
, which he uses directly against the Straw Hats.
History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
On the night before the
Raid on Onigashima
, Hawkman was dispatched alongside his allies
Ageha Woman
and
Koshi Falcon
by the
Shogun
Orochi
to blow up the
Thousand Sunny
, as well as various other ships and infrastructure all around
Wano Country
. The order was given with the intent to stop the rebel forces in Wano, which Hawkman had no issue with, and promptly did as asked.
On the night of the raid, Hawkman confronted the
Straw Hat Pirates
and their allies directly, leading a small fleet of his own. Hawkman was surprised to see that the Sunny was still able to float, but that it didn't matter, as the raiding party was heavily outnumbered. He explained he and his crew's previous actions, and that the raid was over before it even started. Moments later, as a result of his gloating,
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Eustass Kid
, and
Trafalgar D. Water Law
easily made their way aboard the ship, before unleashing separate attacks to sink it. Hawkman was not seen afterwards, leaving his fate unknown.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Hawkman is defeated by Luffy.
In the anime, his actual interactions with the Straw Hats are extended significantly, with he and his two partners attacking the Sunny with various explosives. While his fate was left unclear in the manga, the anime has Luffy explicitly defeat him aboard his own ship.
