Gerd
is a
giant
from
Elbaph
and the
doctor
of the
New Giant Warrior Pirates
. She was formerly an S-Class ranked
mercenary
for
Buggy's Delivery
.
Appearance
[
]
Gerd is a slender and taller than average giantess with long blonde hair, part of which is kept in two braids on the sides of her head. She has light blue eyes. She wears a revealing one-piece purple fur garment with a neckline that goes down to her stomach and which leaves the sides of her legs completely exposed. She also wears a very long black and yellow striped stocking on her left leg that nearly goes up to her waist, as well as an eggshell cape with tatters on the bottom and fur boots.
As a child, she had shoulder-length hair and she wore a light blue long-sleeved dress, and has her hair arranged in two braids under a yellow checkered kerchief.
Personality
[
]
During her childhood, Gerd seemed to be an amicable little girl, as she readily talked to
Charlotte Linlin
despite sometimes being afraid of her. Like Linlin, she loves sweets, particularly
semla
, which she explained to Linlin with great enthusiasm. She cares about her village, as she immediately reported to Mother
Carmel
when Linlin was going on a rampage through it.
Gerd is incredibly kindhearted, as she tried to help the relationships between the
Sheep's house
children and the
giants
.
Though Gerd was deeply traumatized by Linlin's rampage at Elbaph, she overcame it to become a strong warrior.
Relationships
[
]
Hajrudin
[
]
Gerd knew
Hajrudin
since both their childhoods, as she watched him train to be a warrior.
Upon growing up, she joined him in order to spiritually revive the
Giant Warrior Pirates
, and left
Buggy's Delivery
to integrate their crew into the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
instead.
Road
[
]
Compared with her other crewmates, Gerd outright states her dislike of
Road
, considering him to be a "weirdo" and that he was the real "Shame of Elbaph" rather than
Loki
.
Goldberg
[
]
Gerd and
Goldberg
get along well enough, and she appears to trust him enough to share her thoughts with him about Road.
Piper
[
]
Piper
is Gerd's pet owl. She appears to have trust and faith in it, having decided to investigate Road's house based off of what it told her.
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Gerd came to know
Charlotte Linlin
since their childhood, and the two seemingly got along amiably. However, at times, Gerd was somewhat afraid of Linlin's uncontrollable strength. Gerd explained the traditions of the
Winter Solstice Festival
to Linlin, particularly the
semla
that they would be eating before the twelve days fasting.
However, upon the seventh day of the fasting, their relationship would break down when Linlin's eating disorder for semla caused her to rampage throughout the Elbaph village, engulfing the area in a sea of flames while injuring many giants, including delivering a dishonorable and fatal injury to the elder hero,
Jorul
, scenes that Gerd watched in utter horror. As with the rest of the giant tribe, Gerd would come to hold a deep hatred for Linlin that would only increase when word got out that she was responsible for the deaths of
Carmel
and the
Sheep's House
orphans, and later when Linlin attempted to undermine an arranged marriage with her 23rd daughter and giant prince
Loki
.
