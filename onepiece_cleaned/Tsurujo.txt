Personality
[
]
Tsuru is a very kind and compassionate woman. Upon seeing
Kurozumi Tama
being badly poisoned, Tsuru offered to help her.
She can be very forceful when helping people as shown when she angrily scolded Tama for refusing to eat the dish she prepared for her.
Kiku also stated Tsuru would never accept people refusing her help. Tsuru has an extremely refined and sophisticated personality as she always speaks to people in a courteous manner and is always ready to repay other people for helping her. After Zoro rescued her from some of Kaidou's thugs, she quickly offered to repay him, and that she sneaked aboard
Komachiyo
's tail when Zoro and Luffy retreated in order to not lose sight of them as she wished to express her gratitude.
She is quite perceptive, as she saw through
Kikunojo
's disguise and realized her husband was still alive. She is also brave, preparing to risk her own life to protect her husband.
Relationships

Family
[

Kin'emon
[
]
Tsuru is the wife of
Kin'emon
.
They have known each other since childhood. During their younger years, Tsuru would threaten Kin'emon if he tried taking her money. She was deeply concerned with Kin'emon's well-being, begging him to quit living as a thug and find a normal job, and she was upset when Kin'emon disregarded her advice by claiming no one would care even if he were to die. When he thought that Tsuru was devoured by the Mountain God, Kin'emon furiously attacked the beast, stating that he had no right to live if Tsuru were to die because of his actions. She is extremely faithful to Kin'emon since she did not remarry after 20 years. Kin'emon was glad to hear that she was alright and he is concerned for her well-being as he went to rescue her after seeing Kaidou in Kuri.
Tsuru already knew about Kin'emon's survival after seeing Kikunojo and she kept it a secret to protect him.
Friends
[
]
Kouzuki Family
[
]
Like her husband, Tsuru is a loyalist of the Kouzuki Family, being nostalgic of the days when the
Kouzuki Family
ruled over Wano Country.
Tsuru also did her best to support the Nine Red Scabbards to overthrow Orochi and restore the Kouzuki back to power.
Kikunojo
[
]
Tsuru recognized
Kikunojo
when the
samurai
reappeared in Wano, so Tsuru kept the knowledge to herself
and hired Kiku as an employee.
Kiku, who was aware that Tsuru is
Kin'emon
's wife, thought she had successfully deceived Tsuru.
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
Tsuru was very grateful to
Roronoa Zoro
for saving her and wanted to repay her debt. She offered to treat his wounds, and she calls him "Sir Green". She was also impressed of how Zoro and
Monkey D. Luffy
managed to ward off
Basil Hawkins
.
Kurozumi Tama
[
]
Tsuru knows
Kurozumi Tama
and knowing she drank from a contaminated river after seeing her in a seriously ill state, she wanted to treat her at her tea house instead of taking her to a doctor.
Abilities and Powers
[

As the owner of the tea house in Okobore Town, Tsuru has the highest authority within the establishment. She is knowledgeable of herbs, utilizing
Jagan Grass
(
邪含草
,
Jagan-sō
?

to brew a medicinal tea to heal Tama from the poison she ingested.
She is also an excellent chef, able to cook delicious food from leftover ingredients.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Years ago during the
Kouzuki Family
's reign, Tsuru worked as a poster girl for a mountain pass tea house. At one time 41 years ago, three customers were telling her about a
moving mountain
before showing her a
white boar
. Tsuru then caught
Kin'emon
taking her money and reprimanded him.
After Kin'emon stole the white boar from these three men, they took Tsuru hostage. However, on the way down the mountain, they were attacked by the Mountain God. Tsuru and two of the men were swallowed by the beast. After
Kouzuki Oden
struck down the beast at the
Flower Capital
, Tsuru reunited with Kin'emon and embraced him.
She happily read the news of Oden and his companions bringing order to
Kuri
.
Tsuru eventually married Kin'emon.
When Kin'emon was sent to the future via
Kouzuki Toki
's
powers
, Tsuru was left without her husband for 20 years. She remained faithful to him, as she never remarried despite the potential danger she would be in from
Kurozumi Orochi
's corrupt rule.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
At a wasteland in the Kuri region, Tsuru was being chased by some
Beasts Pirates
until
Roronoa Zoro
came to her rescue. She wanted to repay him, but Zoro was only interested in booze.
She then hid in
Komachiyo
's tail as Zoro and
Monkey D. Luffy
were confronted by
Basil Hawkins
and his men. When the komainu dragged the two
Straw Hat Pirates
away from the battle, she introduced herself to them. Upon seeing
Kurozumi Tama
in critical condition, she asked them to bring Tama to her tea shop where she could make medicine for her. They later arrived at Okobore Town.
After healing Tama, Tsuru gave her some delicious foods to eat. Tsuru then told Luffy and Zoro the story about Okobore Town before Zoro saved her from an arrow fired by the Gifter
Batman
. During the confusion, Tama was abducted by
Gazelleman
. As Zoro and Luffy joined
Kikunojo
and Komachiyo in the pursuit, Tsuru was amazed by Luffy's
ability to stretch
.
Sometime after Luffy, Zoro, and Kiku left, a villager visited Tsuru and asked her for some herbs for his ill child.
Tsuru was later overjoyed when Luffy's group returned with a cart of food.
When
Kaidou
arrived at Kuri, a villager told Tsuru to flee.
After Kaidou left, Tsuru tended to an injured man.
Sometime later when
Tony Tony Chopper
,
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, Kiku, and Tama brought an amnesiac
Big Mom
to Okobore Town, Tsuru gave her some food.
Prior to the
Fire Festival
,
Holed'em
confronted the Okobore Town citizens concerning the
Paradise Farm
thefts. Assuming that Kin'emon must be alive after meeting Kikunojo, Tsuru attempted to mislead Holed'em, but the Okobore Town citizens took the blame for the thefts. Okobore Town was then burned to the ground.
Tsuru survived the incident and reunited with her husband after the
raid on Onigashima
, and together they celebrated the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's victory.
Later, Tsuru spoke with
Chocho
about moving back to the Flower Capital to be with Kin'emon, with Chocho encouraging her to do so.
