Marguerite
is a member of the
Kuja
tribe living on the island of
Amazon Lily
. She, along with
Aphelandra
and
Sweet Pea
, saved
Luffy
after he ate mushrooms that completely covered his body.
During the timeskip, she became a member of the
Kuja Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Marguerite is a young
Kuja
lady who is tall for her age. She has short, unruly blond hair, long slender legs, and a slim, curvaceous figure.
Like her fellow Kuja, she dresses in a revealing bikini top and miniskirt made out of animal skin that greatly show off her cleavage and long legs, and a white cape that seems to resemble a Marine jacket. She keeps her snake (which almost all Kuja women seem to have) who is black and green striped wrapped around her waist at most times. She is also known to wear some type of black and white striped legging similar to a stocking on her right leg, along with high-heeled boots.
Personality
[
]
Although it is forbidden to have men on the Amazon Lily, Marguerite seems to have developed an interest in them ever since seeing Luffy. She also seems to have developed an interest in Luffy's "Kintama" (a Japanese slang term for the male testicle which literally translates to "Golden ball(s)"), wanting Luffy to take them off, so she could have a look at them. This is mostly due to her misunderstanding and naïveté towards men, taking everything Luffy said as literal. She deems men as "useless" based on the impressions left by Luffy, but at the same time admitted that she risked becoming attached to him if she stayed with him for too long, resulting in attacking him as a way of stopping herself.
Like the rest of the Kuja tribe, she eventually begins to care for and respect Luffy during the
Amazon Lily Arc
.
She also admires her leader,
Boa Hancock
, calling her "the most beautiful woman in the world", and seems to hold no grudge against Hancock for petrifying her.
Marguerite is very honest, shown when she tried to take the full blame for Luffy's presence on Amazon Lily, prompting Sweet Pea and Aphelandra to also try to take the blame with her. She is also very moral, as she could not bring herself to attack a
child
, even when said child was very powerful and attacking her.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Marguerite appears to be a talented seamstress, as she was able to completely replicate Luffy's tattered vest and shorts, and even added a floral pattern and frills to his vest, much to his dismay.
She also knows how to swim, as proven when she saved Luffy from drowning. Another note is that Amazon Lily is located in the
Calm Belt
where
Sea Kings
breed and so the sea around the island is full of Sea Kings, yet she jumped in to save Luffy despite this.
She was seen accompanying Boa Hancock on the Kuja pirate ship after the two-year timeskip, indicating that she has become strong enough to become part of the crew, since only the strongest warriors are allowed on the ship.
Weapons
[
]
Marguerite drawing her Snake Bow.
As with most of the other Kuja warriors, Marguerite uses a
snake
that can morph into a bow to launch arrows at her target. She imbues
Armament Haki
into the arrows to increase their destructive powers, being able to pierce through trees with ease.
While threatening Luffy to stay away from her, she held a dagger against him.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Like all the members of the Kuja tribe, Marguerite possesses Haki, a manifestation of willpower of sorts. She can channel
Armament Haki
through her arrows, though she is unaware of its use in suppressing
Devil Fruits
. This puts her above most other characters seen in the series as Haki is not a widely used ability. After the timeskip, Marguerite has seemingly become a member of the Kuja pirate crew and thus she may have improved her abilities to use Haki.
History
[
]
Summit War Saga
[
]
Amazon Lily Arc
[
]
Marguerite,
Aphelandra
, and
Sweet Pea
found
Monkey D. Luffy
after he fell victim to a
mushroom that began spreading all over his body
. Believing him to be a woman, the three women brought him back to the
Kuja
tribe and helped him get rid of the mushrooms, until only "one" was left. After realizing it would not come off,
Elder Nyon
recognized Luffy as a man.
When Luffy woke up, Marguerite gave him new clothes similar to his old ones but with a flower motif stitched onto the shirt. When the Kuja threatened to kill Luffy, he attempted to flee but then remembered that the
Vivre Card
he needed to find
Silvers Rayleigh
was still in his old clothes. He then identified Marguerite as the one who gave him his new clothes and carried her into the jungle with him to ask for them back.
She gave his clothes back to him, and despite acting distrustful of him for kidnapping her, she was unable to contain her curiosity and, after he mentioned that he is a
pirate
, told him about the Kuja's leader, Pirate Empress
Boa Hancock
.
Though curious about who Luffy was and experiencing Luffy's simple-minded thinking first hand, she soon returned to her mission and drew her bow on Luffy as he ran off.
Aphelandra, Marguerite and Sweet Pea turned to stone by Boa Hancock.
After Luffy accidentally encountered Hancock and was sent to the arena to fight to the death, Marguerite, Aphelandra, and Sweet Pea stood up for Luffy and attempted to protect him. Uninterested in their pleas, Hancock used
her Devil Fruit powers
and turned the trio into stone, which brought about Luffy's wrath.
Before engaging the sisters, Luffy put the petrified bodies aside, hoping to keep them intact long enough to find a way to return her to normal. Midway through the battle,
Boa Sandersonia
grabbed Marguerite with her tail, intending to smash her to punish Luffy, as
Boa Marigold
suggested that Luffy's death is not enough for Hancock. Luffy managed to use
Supreme King Haki
in order to make Sandersonia stop, saving Marguerite.
After Luffy won the fight against the Boa sisters, he requested that Marguerite and her friends be returned to normal since he did not see it as fair that they should have to suffer just for saving him, and the three were revived.
After noticing that Luffy was rather uncomfortable about being probed by the curious women of the Kuja, she escaped with him to Elder Nyon's house, thanking him on the way for keeping her petrified body safe during the arena fight. At Nyon's house, she made tea while Elder Nyon read the announcement of
Ace
's execution and heard Luffy's adamant determination to find him.
After Luffy convinced Boa Hancock to take the
World Government
's order and her pirate ship is ready for travel, Luffy personally thanked Marguerite and her friends for saving him, promising them he would return with his crew on the next visit, which they had no qualms over.
Post-War Arc
[
]
Marguerite and the other Kuja rejoiced when Luffy returned. She told the other Kujas that they needed to welcome Luffy back properly when he recovered. She then happily stated that she would make more clothes without frills for Luffy.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Marguerite is topless when washing Luffy in the river in the manga but is clothed in the anime.
Her parting with Luffy at the end of the Amazon Lily Arc is considerably expanded when compared to the corresponding manga scene. Here, he describes his crew to her at length, and while the Kuja ship pulls away she thinks back to their time together on the island and is shown to be quite saddened at his departure, before calling out to Luffy asking if they will definitely get to meet his crew, to which he cheerfully affirms.
In the anime, Marguerite was relieved to see that Hancock has returned, but got worried about Luffy's condition. A few days later, she and her fellow Kujas, Kikyo, Aphelandra, and Sweet Pea have a brief interaction with the
Heart Pirates
and provide them food while the men are treating a wounded Luffy. Marguerite briefly talks with
Trafalgar Law
, asking him about Luffy's condition.
In the anime, Marguerite is present on the Kuja ship when Luffy bidding goodbye to
Jinbe
and landed on
Rusukaina
.
In the anime, Marguerite and her group notices a fleet of Marines on the Calm Belt and reported to
Gloriosa
.
In the anime, Marguerite retaliated against the invading Marines by shooting arrows at them and telling them to leave Amazon Lily, as well as desperately trying to stop Sweet Pea, who was attacked by S-Snake.
In the anime, Marguerite and Sweet Pea were present in the Kuja crowd when Rayleigh forces Blackbeard to leave Amazon Lily.
