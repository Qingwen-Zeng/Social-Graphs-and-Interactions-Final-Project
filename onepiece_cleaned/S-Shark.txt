Egghead Arc
[
]
In order to test S-Shark,
Lilith
,
Pythagoras
, and
Edison
had it battle
Sanji
,
Nami
,
Usopp
,
Robin
, and
Franky
simultaneously, until
Shaka
intervened, ordering the Pacifista to stand down, while restraining the
Straw Hat Pirates
with their Dom-Shoes.
CP0 takes command of the Seraphim.
Upon
CP0
infiltrating Egghead in order to kill Vegapunk and his satellites, Shaka had
S-Hawk
,
S-Snake
, and S-Shark deployed under the command of
Sentomaru
.
While
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Rob Lucci
began fighting, the three Seraphim met up with Sentomaru. The group encountered the invading government agents, during which Sentomaru instructed both S-Shark and S-Hawk to hold back CP0 while S-Snake assisted the Straw Hat Pirates with fleeing with Vegapunk.
Obeying Sentomaru's commands, the three Seraphim were joined by
S-Bear
with assaulting the government agents until Sentomaru succumbed to his injuries, resulting in the four Seraphim following CP0's command.
After CP0 had infiltrated Egghead's Labophase while its defense system had been deactivated, the four Seraphim took the initative to follow the assassins. When they arrived, Lucci ordered them to destroy Vegapunk's laboratory before he comes out, leading to them damaging the building's structure using a range of attacks.
After
Stussy
had subdued
Kaku
and Lucci,
Edison
approached the Seraphim, during which S-Shark shot a beam at the scientist while he instructed the
Pacifistas
to cease their attacks. After the unsuccessful attack, the Seraphim stopped their assault.
S-Shark ineffectively attacks Sanji.
On
York's
orders,
S-Shark resumed on attacking the Vegapunks and Straw Hats. He attacked
Brook
- taking his head off - and knocked out Edison. Nami then ordered
Zeus
to attack S-Shark, damaging him, but S-Shark swam under the ground and tried to attack Nami, however, Sanji kicked and sent him into an explosion.
S-Shark then punched Sanji, but failed to deal significant damage or even knock him off his feet.
At some point, he and the other Seraphim were captured in
seastone
bubbles and left in the laboratory's basement with the imprisoned
Cipher pol
agents.
After
Nusjuro
cut the Labophase, S-Hawk, the other Seraphim, and the imprisoned Cipher Pol agents fell to the Fabiriophase.
