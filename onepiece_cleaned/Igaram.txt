For the non-canon disciple of Karoo, see
Igaram Jr.
.
Igaram
is the captain of the
Arabasta
royal guard (captain of Arabasta security in the English dub).
He aided
Nefertari Vivi
in infiltrating
Baroque Works
as a
Frontier Agent
and took on the codename
Mr. 8
.
He was partnered with
Miss Monday
.
He is also
Terracotta
's husband.
He is an ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the
Whisky Peak
(after being a minor antagonist) and
Arabasta
Arcs.
Appearance
[
]
Igaram is a tall man with a small red nose and has blond hair in a style that resembles a powdered
Wig
.
Under the guise of Mr. 8, he dressed like a gentleman. Reflecting his codename Mr. 8, he has the number 8 at the tips of his collar. The curls in his hair also look similar to the number 8.
After the timeskip, Igaram has a small mustache. He also sported a black coat, over a spotted light colored shirt, under a sash around his stomach, which is striped around the edges.
Personality
[
]
Igaram is extremely loyal to Vivi and he is prepared to give his life for her. He is also extremely worried about her when her life is threatened and in those cases can be very overprotective.
Igaram has a unique way of speaking. Whenever his voice gets tired, he clears it by going "Ma~ma~ma~" ("Mi~mi~mi~" in the English manga) like an opera singer.
Relationships

Friends
[

Nefertari Vivi
[
]
Igaram takes very good care of Vivi to a point that he is like a second father to her. While taking on the role as Mr. 8, Igaram acted as the superior to Vivi's cover identity of Miss Wednesday.
Igaram tends to worry a lot over Vivi and usually disapproves of her doing anything that could be considered risky or dangerous. After Vivi's disappearance during the latest
Levely
, Igaram could not contain his tears when handling missing posters of his princess.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Igaram was initially hostile towards the Straw Hats while he was posing as Mr. 8 of Baroque Works. After he and his fellow agents at Whisky Peak were defeated by Zoro, Igaram told Nami about Baroque Works and begged Nami to ensure that Vivi safely returned to her kingdom.
After Crocodile's defeat, Igaram was grateful to the crew for their actions and helped provide shelter for them from the Marines. He was later surprised to read in a newspaper that Nico Robin joined the crew.
Enemies
[
]
Baroque Works
[
]
As Arabasta suffered due to Crocodile's machinations, Igaram and Vivi infiltrated his organization in order to uncover his identity. After they achieved this due to Nico Robin (also known as Miss All Sunday) allowing this, Crocodile took action against them and sent agents to eliminate them. After the Straw Hats agreed to escort Vivi back to Arabasta, Igaram decided to use himself as a decoy only to be seemingly killed in an explosion. Igaram survived and he returned to his kingdom to reveal Baroque Works' ploy to the people.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the head of the Arabasta Royal Guards, Igaram has command over the entire force under the Nefertari family, leaving his position of power to
Chaka
while absent. As he is capable of becoming a
frontier agent
of
Baroque Works
, Igaram is considered to be a powerful fighter himself. He is also good with disguises.
Weapons
[
]
Igaram's abilities are based on firearms hidden in non-conspicuous places on his person. He fights with a saxophone that shoots bullets when played,
and he also has small guns hidden in his hair that fire when he pulls on his necktie.
Attack List
[
]
Igarappa
(
イガラッパ
,
Igarappa
?
)
: Igaram attacks with his saxophone, which fires a blast of bullets when played, like a giant shotgun.
The name is possibly a portmanteau of
Igaramu
(
イガラム
?
, Igaram)
and
rappa
(
ラッパ or 喇叭
?
, "trumpet or horn")
. In the 4Kids dub, it is mistakenly called
Igarappappa
.
Igaram shooting with
Igarappappa
.
Igarappappa
(
イガラッパッパ
,
Igarappappa
?
)
: After pulling his necktie strings to expose the gun barrels hidden in the curls of his hair, he attacks by pulling the loops of his necktie to fire explosive bullets. According to Zoro, this technique (along with his rather unorthodox saxophone shotgun) makes Igaram seem like an action figure.
It is mistakenly called
Igarappa
in the Odex dub.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
24 years ago, after
Gol D. Roger
's execution, Igaram was seen with Cobra and Titi discussing about the new age.
At one point Igaram was seen discussing with the king about the drought in other regions when Igaram brought out how much money would they give for their benefit. When Vivi arrives bloodied and tells them how she fought
Koza
to which Igaram gets angry at Koza and wants to kill him only to be stopped by Cobra. He later accompanied Cobra in spying at Vivi and notes that Vivi has made friends. While spying on her, he was noticed and called out by Toto who asks him if he wants onigiri to which he replies that he already has some. Next day they notice at shock that all the children are bloodied and learns what happened. When Vivi was about to be kidnapped by the bandits, Cobra and Igaram intervene and defeat them. Igaram then asks if she was alright. He then arranges for the injured children to be taken care of. Later he listens to Cobra and Koza talking about the incident and notes that Vivi was worried about losing her friends. He and Cobra then walk away and discuss about Vivi and her decisions. When Pell slapped Vivi, Igaram became furious and was about to attack him, only to be stopped by Cobra. Eight years ago, Igaram was at
Levely
when
Wapol
slapped Vivi, to which he comforted her.
Due to a series of droughts, civil unrest and talks of rebellion happening within the
Arabasta Kingdom
, the King was unfairly blamed for the kingdoms problems, and the Princess wanted to investigate a criminal organizations' possible connection to these events to prove her father's innocence and save the kingdom. As the Captain of the Royal Guard, Igaram decided to help her with this investigation and protect her. He and
Princess Vivi
infiltrated
Baroque Works
and manage to become
Frontier Agents
in order to learn of the organization's true boss and objectives. He was known as
Mr. 8
by most of Baroque Works before being exposed and was partnered with
Miss Monday
, and before being exposed Vivi went by
Miss Wednesday
and was partnered with
Mr. 9
. During this time the two kept in contact, and the two worked various jobs with their partners to maintain their covers, including bounty hunting. Igaram's work led to him operating on
Cactus Island
, becoming the mayor of
Whisky Peak
, using the town as a front for the Baroque Works agents, with the agents posing as the townspeople and luring pirates to the town as tourists, in order to ambush them and collect their bounties, while his partner posed as one of towns nuns.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Whisky Peak Arc
[
]
When the
Straw Hat Pirates
arrived at
Whisky Peak
, Igaram greeted them under the guise of Igarappoi and invited them to party with the townsfolk. When Nami asked him how long it would take for their
Log Pose
to record the island's frequency, Igaram claimed he would discuss this with her after the pirates had rested before telling the townspeople to welcome the Straw Hats.
As the celebrations progressed, Igaram proclaimed that the Straw Hats' happiness was all that mattered to them.
Mr. 8 and Frontier Agents of Whisky Peak gathered to capture the Straw Hat Pirates.
After the Straw Hats had all seemingly passed out or fallen asleep, Igaram looked at Cactus Mountain while telling them to sleep soundly before he was greeted by
Mr. 9
and
Miss Wednesday
, who called him a poet. When asked about the status of the pirates, Igaram stated they had fallen to Hell. After
Miss Monday
arrived and began bickering with Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday over their failure to obtain whale meat for the town, Igaram told them to calm down before showing them
Monkey D. Luffy
's bounty of
30,000,000, which shocked the trio. Igaram reprimanded Miss Monday for judging the strength of the Straw Hats based on their appearance alone before telling her, Mr. 9, and Miss Wednesday to tie them up and confiscate all valuables from their ship. However, they were interrupted by
Roronoa Zoro
, who asked them to let the Straw Hats continue sleeping and claimed that a true swordsman never allows alcohol to control him when an incredulous Igaram asked him how he was awake after drinking so much. When Zoro mentioned
Baroque Works
by name and explained how he was scouted out by one of its members before, Igaram proclaimed that they must kill him if he knew their secret and ordered the bounty hunters to attack, only to find Zoro was gone. After causing some of the bounty hunters to shoot each other, Zoro appeared behind Igaram with his sword in the latter's hair, causing the remaining bounty hunters to prepare to attack both of them, but Igaram blew the attackers away with Igarappa.
After Zoro disappeared, Igaram wondered if he was actually planning to take on all of them by himself.
When Miss Monday seemingly defeated Zoro, Igaram noted that the latter had made them waste a lot of him, only to be shocked when Zoro suddenly knocked Miss Monday out by squeezing her head with his hand. Seeing this, Igaram assumed that the Marines had made a mistake in assigning the
30,000,000 bounty to Luffy and that it was actually Zoro's bounty.
Igaram told Mr. 9 and Vivi that they had a matter of responsibility to worry about after being defeated to this extent by only one swordsman before attacking Zoro with Igarappa.
After Vivi failed to finish Zoro off due to
Karoo
's misdirection, Igaram attacked Zoro with Igarappa again, but Zoro cut a hole in the roof he was standing on to dodge, which led Igaram to decide to show Zoro his true strength. Soon afterward, Mr. 9 managed to restrain Zoro and Vivi held Luffy hostage, allowing Igaram to attack Zoro with Igarappappa. However, Zoro threw Mr. 9 into Vivi and launched himself toward Igaram using Luffy's stomach before cutting him down.
Igaram protects Vivi after their identity is discovered.
However, Igaram soon got up while noting he could not simply die here before completing his mission, only to be surprised when
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
appeared behind him. When the duo insulted the performance of the defeated agents, an angered Igaram asked them if they had only come to laugh, and was surprised when Mr. 5 refused to help them defeat Zoro. After Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine revealed that they had been sent to dispatch spies from a certain kingdom who had infiltrated Baroque Works, Igaram wondered if this was the end, and when Mr. 5 was about to reveal the names of the spies, Igaram attacked him with Igarappappa before telling Vivi to run away. However, he was defeated by Mr. 5, who hit him with an explosion.
However, Igaram regained consciousness and found Zoro, whom he begged to protect Vivi in his stead before promising that he would be greatly rewarded by the kingdom of
Arabasta
for doing so. Hearing this, Nami asked Igaram if they would reward the Straw Hats with
1,000,000,000.
Shocked by such an enormous sum of money being requested, Igaram admitted that he could not guarantee this amount because he was only a single soldier. When Nami asked him if Vivi is worth less than this amount despite being the princess of Igaram's kingdom, Igaram told her that she could most likely negotiate with Vivi herself to receive this money after escorting her back to Arabasta. Nami noted that he was asking them to save Vivi first, but Igaram proclaimed that there was no time to negotiate because Vivi's life was currently in danger. After Nami sent Zoro off to protect Vivi, Igaram noted that it would be the end of Arabasta if anything happened to Vivi.
After the Straw Hats were informed of
Mr. 0
's identity by Vivi, Igaram showed up while dressed as Vivi and informed them that Baroque Works would be sending assassins after them now that they knew this secret, especially since they were able to defeat Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine. When Igaram asked Luffy if he had decided to take Vivi back to Arabasta, Luffy agreed to do so. Igaram asked Vivi to give him the
Eternal Pose
to Arabasta and explained what it was to Nami before revealing that he would be setting off for Arabasta with three dummies called
Henohenounchi
and pretend to be Vivi and the Straw Hats, which would cause their pursuers to follow him instead. Later, at the port, Igaram told Vivi to take care on her dangerous journey ahead before setting sail. As Igaram expressed his confidence that Vivi would be able to save their kingdom, his ship was blown up by
Miss All-Sunday
, seemingly killing him.
Arabasta Arc
[
]
Igaram survived the incident at Whisky Peak and hurried back to Arabasta in order to stop the civil war.
After the defeat of
Crocodile
, Igaram arrived at
Nanohana
(which appeared to be what Robin intended). He finally caught up with the rebellion carrying a witness,
Kappa
, who saw
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
remove his disguise as
Nefertari Cobra
, the king of Arabasta, which was proof that the rebellion was started by Baroque Works and not by the king.
Igaram posed as Vivi, during a speech to the people of Arabasta, so she could sneak away secretly to say goodbye to the Straw Hats.

[
]
Zou Arc
[

[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the
anime
, because Vivi's circled shirt as Miss Wednesday is changed to a striped shirt, this is also changed in Igaram's costume when he impersonates Vivi at the time of leaving
Whisky Peak
, also wearing a shirt with stripes instead of circles like in the
manga
.
Igaram is absent from the movie
Episode of Arabasta: The Desert Princess and the Pirates
, which adapts the
Arabasta Arc
. Because of this, it is
Terracotta
who pretends to be Vivi when she says goodbye to the Straw Hat Pirates. Even so, he does appear in the extended television version in new scenes that adapt content from the
Whiskey Peak Arc
, but by not appearing later, the film implies that Igaram died after his sacrifice.
