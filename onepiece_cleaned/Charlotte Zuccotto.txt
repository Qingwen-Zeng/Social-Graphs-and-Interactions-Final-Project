Zuccotto attended the tea party and wedding between
Sanji
and
Charlotte Pudding

where he took part in
Big Mom
's plan to assassinate the
Vinsmoke Family
. He was sitting with
Charlotte Basskarte

Daifuku

After
Monkey D. Luffy
and his allies crashed the wedding, Zuccotto and some of his crewmates trapped the Vinsmokes and held them at gunpoint, with Zuccotto pointing his gun at
Vinsmoke Judge
's head.
However, Big Mom's
scream
incapacitated them, allowing the
Straw Hats
to free the Vinsmokes.
As the alliance's plan backfired, Zuccotto witnessed Bege using his
Big Father form
,
and he again tried to shoot at the Vinsmokes. However, by that time, his targets were able to put on their
raid suits
, which protected them from the bullets.
Zuccotto later saw Big Mom attack the enemy alliance herself,
while
