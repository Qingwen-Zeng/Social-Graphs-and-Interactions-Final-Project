and the other Gifters as they watched the fights. When

and demanded to see
Holed'em
, Snakeman ordered his crew to fight Luffy and his company.
The Beasts Pirates try to take back the food supply.
Later, after Luffy and his group had stolen a cart of food from Bakura Town, Snakeman, Rabbitman, and

chased after them into Okobore Town. They tried to stop the townspeople from eating the food, but were ignored. Snakeman then noticed something looming over them before Luffy suddenly crushed them under a giant container of water as he tossed it down.
