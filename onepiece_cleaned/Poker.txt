When the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
invaded
Onigashima on the day of the
Fire Festival
, Poker and
Mizerka
were stationed on the third level at the base of the stairs to the fourth level. Although
Eustass Kid
managed to get by them, the duo received a report that
Monkey D. Luffy
and his group were headed their way. Poker looked forward to taking on Luffy to keep his reputation intact and to be promoted to the
Tobiroppo
. To their surprise, Luffy never arrived as his allies had built a ladder to the fourth level elsewhere.
Later,
Daifugo
forced Poker to eat one of
Kurozumi Tama
's
kibi dangos
.
Poker was on the fourth floor near where
Jinbe
and
Who's-Who
were fighting when Tama ordered the tamed Gifters to take down
Kaidou
's forces, and Poker began attacking his former comrades around him so Jinbe could focus on Who's-Who.
