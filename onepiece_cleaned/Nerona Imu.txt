Saint Imu of the

800 years ago. It has been theorized by
Emporio Ivankov
that this person and the mysterious
Imu
who secretly occupies the
Empty Throne
may actually be one and the same, possibly having gained eternal life by way of the
Ope Ope no Mi
's Perennial Youth Operation.

Biography
[
]
St. Imu of the
Nerona Family
was one of the
First Twenty
monarchs who eventually founded what today is known as the World Government.
Legacy
[
]
During the latest
Levely
at
Mary Geoise
,
Imu
showed themself in the Empty Throne's hall while King
Nefertari Cobra
was present, causing the
Five Elders
to shout their name. Confused, Cobra wondered aloud if the person before him was related to "Imu" of the
First Twenty
, but the figure before him refused to answer.
On
Momoiro Island
, after
Sabo
had finished explaining to
Dragon
and
Ivankov
what had transpired during the Levely, Ivankov theorized that the mysterious Imu who seems to rule the World Government in secret is Nerona Imu, who could have been given eternal life. Ivankov noted that he could imagine no one else but one of the First Twenty to hold the power to outright order around the Five Elders, who are publicly the powerful World Government's heads as the highest-ranking
Celestial Dragons
there are.
