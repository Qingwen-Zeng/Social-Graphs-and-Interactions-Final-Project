He stayed with the other children in Biscuits Room on Punk Hazard until the
Straw Hats
broke them out.
Later, he succumbed to the withdrawal symptoms from
NHC10
, which he and the other children were fed regularly in candy form. Eventually,
Usopp
knocked the children all out with sleeping gas, and then the Straw Hats chained the children up for their safety.
Doran was then seen breaking out of the chains and attacking Nami and Usopp due to the side effects of NHC10. He then left with Caesar for the drug.
Doran was later seen attempting to break down the door to the Biscuits Room entrance.
He then chased after
Mocha

Eventually, Doran and the other children were stopped for a short period by Nami. She used her Milky Ball technique to do this. The children ended up breaking out of it though, and continued to chase after Mocha. After Doran, along with the other children, caught up to Mocha and began to attack her, Mocha ate all the candy. Doran, along with the other children got angry at her, but also wondered why she was hurting. He then watched as she was in pain on the ground, and continued to wonder why she was hurting.
Suddenly, Sanji and the G-5 Marines appeared in the hallway. They tied Doran and the other children up, which prevented them from moving.
