When Morgan was discovered that
Rika
was still alive after trespassing into the courtyard of the Marine base, he immediately ordered Rokkaku to go into town and kill her. Rokkaku refused to do so because she was just a little girl. Upon hearing this, Morgan exclaimed that his orders were absolute, but Rokkaku refused once again. Because of this "insubordination", he was slashed down the back by Morgan's axe-hand.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The anime downplays the wound he receives from Morgan, framing it to seem like a bludgeon from the axe's blunt handle rather than an outright slash across the torso.
In the Manga Rokkaku's facial hair was not colored in, but in the Anime it takes a darker colour.
