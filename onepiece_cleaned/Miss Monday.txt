Appearance
[
]
Miss Monday is a tall, muscular woman with dark skin and pink hair pulled into short twin-tails. She wears a short dress with a magenta and white diamond pattern, and three green flowers.
A distinctive feature of hers is her soft high-pitched voice more commonly associated with small, frail girls (which helps when it comes to disguising, as seen when she posed as a nun without her true size and strength being noticed
).
After the timeskip, she has let her hair down and seems to have a generally slimmer physique, though still very muscular.
Personality
[
]
Miss Monday is very self-confident, impulsive, and relies heavily on her strength, despite this, she is a loyal person who appreciates friendship, as she was willing to risk her life to save one of her former Baroque Works companions:
Miss Wednesday
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Miss Monday´s great strength is demonstrated with her punch.
Miss Monday has incredible strength compared to a normal human as evidenced by her muscle mass and size and by the fact that the
Millions
from Whisky Peak along with
Mr. 8
,
Mr. 9
and
Miss Wednesday
were really surprised when someone overpowered her in strength. This strength still pales before foes such as
Roronoa Zoro
. Miss Monday uses her strength in battle, typically attacking with her fists or nearby objects.
Weapons
[
]
Miss Monday uses a metal sheath on her right hand in combat. After the timeskip, she is shown with a musket strapped to her back. It is unknown if she knew how to use it before the events of Whisky Peak or if she learned how to use it afterwards.

History

Arabasta Saga
[
]
Whisky Peak Arc
[
]
Miss Monday, under the alias "sister" confronts Nami in a drinking competition as the pirate's 15th opponent. After Zoro fell asleep from too much drinking Miss Monday told Nami that the pirate should also stop drinking for the sake of Nami's health. Nami falls asleep so Miss Monday wins.
Miss Monday and Frontier Agents of Whisky Peak gathered to capture the Straw Hat Pirates.
After all the Straw Hat Pirates fell asleep Miss Monday got out of the house and took out her costume. Miss Monday commended the pirates on the amount they could drink and eat and revealed that she was only drinking Sparkling Tea. Miss Monday asked Igarappoi why did they have to stage the welcome party, arguing that the Straw Hat pirates look weak. Miss Monday argued that they should have crushed the pirates in the harbor because the town is already short enough on food and they wouldn't be able to get the whale's meat. This caused Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday to get mad and defend themselves. Miss Monday was surprised to see Luffy's bounty poster shown by Igarappoi. Miss Monday apologized for misjudging the pirates' strength from their appearances.
Miss Monday is easily overpowered by Zoro.
After Roronoa Zoro showed how powerful he was against the millions, Miss Monday, alongside Mr. 8,
Mr. 9
, and Miss Wednesday (
Princess Vivi
) decided they had to deal with the pirate hunter themselves. Miss Monday was surprised to see that Zoro decided to take on all the Baroque Works agents on Whisky Peak all by himself. While Zoro was occupied with 4 Millions, Miss Monday threw a barrel at him, but Zoro managed to cut it in 4 parts defeating the 4 Millions. After a few moments, Miss Monday appeared again and attacked Zoro with a ladder, but Zoro dodged it and the ladder broke in half when it hit the wall. Miss Monday put on a metal sheath on right hand knuckles, caught Zoro by his neck and hit him in the face with the move "Superhuman Brass Knuckles". Zoro caught Miss Monday by her head and overpowered her and deemed her unconscious. For Miss Monday to lose a contest of strength was something that surprised the millions and the 3 officers present in the scene.
Miss Monday is defeated by Mr. 5.
Later, while Vivi was being exposed by
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
and attempted to escape Cactus  Island,
a wounded Miss Monday got up from her encounter with Zoro at some point and tried to hold off the officers pursuing Vivi with a large, wooden log, reasoning that she would get punished anyway for failing to defeat Zoro and saying that she was willing to go down if it meant helping out Vivi, who she considered her friend. Both Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine mocked Miss Monday for her sacrifice and attempt to challenge them before the former unleashed his
ability
upon her, instantly knocking the frontier agent out through an explosion.
Miss Monday, however, ended up surviving the attack in the end.
