Appearance
[

Stussy appears younger than her actual age, with short curly blonde hair, blue eyes, red lipstick, and red-painted fingernails. She has a thin and slightly curved body with large breasts.
As an agent of
CP0
, she wears a uniform consisting of a white dress with a pink necktie, white matching cape and gloves. She also dons fishnet stockings with fluffy rims and a garter belt.
While on duty, she sometimes wears a mask in the form of a hood that covers her head, resembling a fox.
When she attended the recent
Tea Party
as an emperor of the Underworld, she wore a salmon colored dress with a purple end, with pink diamond patterns on the bottom, a small white cape, a sunhat with a flower on it, and high heel shoes with ribbons on top. She also carried a pink handbag with her.
After betraying CP0 during the
Egghead Arc
, Stussy is shown wearing a yellow leotard bodysuit, pink jacket with a hood, along with orange gloves, white tight leggings, an earpiece and DOM Shoes.
Personality
[
]
Stussy shows her ruthless nature after shooting Lu Feld.
Stussy acted polite and disapproved of insults being thrown around, in contrast to her occasionally more hostile fellow emperors.
However, she was sensitive about her age and would get violent if it was brought up.
However, Stussy does possess a sadistic side, shown when she knocked out
Lu Feld
and threatened
Morgans
into creating a false story to cover up her actions.
Also, when her partner
Kaku
was injured due to her withholding information from him, Stussy simply responded in a mocking and flirtatious manner.
Despite this, she is also shown to be a rather diligent and practical person, knowing full well that fighting Kaku and
Lucci
head-on would be a foolish decision.
Likewise, she acted responsibly by notifying
Marine Headquarters
about the presence of one of the
Four Emperors
, knowing that they did not have the authority to engage in a fight against one.
Despite this, Stussy also has a softer side when not undercover, as she expressed sympathy for how
Kuma
would lose his free will and the latter's love for his daughter.
She also decided to free Kaku by considering him as a true friend, further showing her emotional side.
She has some problems with her existence as a clone with a will of her own.
After
Dr. Vegapunk
died, Stussy felt like she had lost her purpose in life until
Edison
changed her mind.
Relationships
[
]
Vegapunk
[
]
Stussy has been very loyal to
Vegapunk
, to the point that she offered her services as a mole, and then openly betrayed her fellow
CP0
agents, even after years of service in
Cipher Pol
.
In fact, she was willing to receive a fatal attack from Lucci in order to protect Vegapunk.
Once she learned that Vegapunk was dead, Stussy declared that she no longer had any purpose in life, and all she wanted was to at least help the
Straw Hats
escape, thinking Vegapunk would hate her if she didn't.
Allies
[
]
Morgans
[
]
Morgans
and Stussy have apparently helped each other several times in the past.
Morgans accepted to cover up her involvement in Big Mom's
Tea Party
and allowed her to take a ride in his balloon in order to sneak away from
Totto Land
.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
At first, Stussy did not seem to care much about the
Straw Hat Pirates
, as she had no problem blaming them for the
Tamatebako
explosion.
However, when Luffy became Emperor, she preferred not to have any sort of confrontation with the crew due to the
World Government
's protocols.
She later became an ally as she was actually on the same side as Vegapunk.
With the latter dead, Stussy was determined to help the crew escape as a final favor to Vegapunk.
Others
[
]
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Stussy has a good relationship with
Big Mom
, who invited her to many of her Tea Parties.
She has even casually called the Emperor by her name "Linlin".
However, Stussy was actually just using Big Mom to gather important information about her.
Despite the Emperor stating how much she appreciated the
Tamatebako
as a gift,
Stussy didn't hesitate to try and get it when given the chance.
CP0
[
]
Stussy seemed to be very close to her companions
Kaku
and
Rob Lucci
,
but did not hesitate to betray them when Vegapunk asked her for help. However, she has come to see the agents as true friends, as she wanted to free Kaku so that he would not suffer the consequences.
When Stussy freed Kaku, they both said goodbye with tears, although the latter denied that there was any kind of friendship.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a successful clone of a former member of the legendary and formidable
Rocks Pirates
, Stussy likely shares the same physical power and skills of the original Stussy.
She must also be an excellent fighter having been a masked agent of
CP0
,
where they are considered the best agents.
Through a stratagem, she managed to defeat her companions
Kaku
and
Rob Lucci
, who were also powerful elite agents of CP0, taking them by surprise knowing that it would be a reckless move to confront them directly.
Stussy also possesses considerable willpower, as she was able to withstand a
Supreme King Haki
blast from
Emperor
Big Mom
.

She can use her fangs to bite into someone's skin and suck their blood like a vampire. Doing so will cause the victim fall unconscious. She can even incapacitate Awakened Zoan users.
In the anime, she also has thermal vision, allowing her to perceive the internal heat generated by blood sources.
Spying and Espionage
[
]
Stussy is a master spy with infiltration skills, being a former secret agent of CP0. She was able to climb the ranks of the Underworld, eventually becoming one of its emperors. As such, Stussy has some degree of power over it, and she is important enough to be invited to Big Mom's
tea parties
.
Furthermore, Stussy was
Vegapunk
's spy in
CP0
for 20 years without being detected.
Physical Abilities
[
]
As a former masked agent of CP0, the strongest Cipher Pol unit, Stussy possesses incredible physical strength. With a single finger thrust, she was able to produce a concentrated shockwave powerful enough to pierce
Lu Feld
, a large man, from a considerable distance, knocking him unconscious.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Stussy was created at
MADS
36 years ago, being a clone of
Buckingham Stussy
and the first known successful clone.
26 years ago, when MADS was dissolved and its members absorbed by the
World Government
, the ten-year-old Stussy was recruited into the organization known as
Cipher Pol
as an orphan.
She eventually became an agent of
CP0
,
but maintained her loyalty to
Vegapunk
and acted as his spy for over two decades.
Sometime after, Stussy began her undercover mission as one of the emperors of the
Underworld
, thus gaining great influence. She even formed a good relationship with
Big Mom
, so she was able to obtain information about the
Emperor
and be invited to many
Tea Parties
. During this time, she also collaborated many times with
Morgans
, where the two have been exchanging valuable information so that Morgans can get exclusive scoops while Stussy gained access to all the
World Economy News Paper
's reports.
About three years ago, Stussy visited Laboratory 8 (the future
Egghead
), where Vegapunk was doing some final phases of the
Bartholomew Kuma
modification process. While there, she congratulated the scientist on the futuristic improvements he had made to the island. Vegapunk then explained that he was now going to float his laboratory and his brain on an island of clouds; in addition to revealing that half of the things on the island were just holograms. Noticing Vegapunk's new head, Stussy told the scientist that she liked his new look, which the latter found amusing. Immediately afterwards, Stussy asked Kuma if he was going to lose his humanity, at the same time wondering if a human without a will was worse than a clone with a will; therefore, Vegapunk reminded the woman that she was human.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[

Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Stussy takes part in the Tea Party festivities.
Stussy received an invitation from Big Mom to attend her Tea Party, where
Charlotte Pudding
and
Sanji
would be married. She and several other emperors of the Underworld arrived at
Whole Cake Island
, where they would then be taken by carriage outside the
Whole Cake Chateau
. Once there, Stussy expressed his disapproval of her when
Lu Feld
and
Drug Peclo
began insulting each other.
Charlotte Perospero
appeared and welcomed them, where he then created an
escalator of candy
to get them to the ceremony faster.
In the lounge,
Charlotte Smoothie
greeted them and offered them some drinks she had, where Stussy drank the option of giraffe juice squeezed by Smothie's
skill
. Immediately after, Big Mom arrived to begin the banquet and welcomed all the guests.
Shortly afterward, Stussy and the other emperors of the Underworld offered their gifts to Big Mom, who was overjoyed by the amount. The latter then told them of the
Tamatebako
, which she would open after the ceremony alongside the other gifts. Stussy and the other guests looked forward to the event with excitement.
Later, as she continued to celebrate with the other guests, Sanji and Pudding entered the venue, who were greeted by everyone present there.
Seeing the couple, Stussy commented on how Pudding reminded her of her younger days, where she then kicked Lu Feld for insulting her about her age. However, moments later
Monkey D. Luffy
emerged from the wedding cake with several clones of himself.
After the latter and his allies began to cause chaos at the wedding venue, Big Mom began screaming with her
Supreme King Haki
, causing Stussy was immobilized and forced to cover her ears.
Stussy shoots Lu Feld to take the Tamatebako for herself.
Right after Lu Feld spotted the Tamatebako on the edge of a lower platform, Stussy confronted him and questioned him on his intentions. When Lu Feld suddenly fell where the chest was, Stussy shot him with a
Tobu Shigan
before the man could open it, emphasizing that the
World Government
would obtain the Tamatebako. After stating that she would blame Lu Feld for the box's disappearance, she noticed that Morgans was hiding, so she told the reporter to deal with the latter. Morgans reluctantly agreed on the condition that she let him see the contents of the treasure, to which Stussy agreed. However, Lu Feld's unconscious body leaned on the chest, causing it to fall.
Stussy and Morgans both watched in shock as the chest dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and exploded.
As the castle collapsed, Stussy used
Geppo
to remain in the air and agreed with Morgans' statement that it would be huge news if this was the end of the
Big Mom Pirates
.
Stussy and Morgans meet with Mont-d'Or and Niwatori.
Hours after the collapse of the Whole Cake Chateau, Stussy and Morgans met with
Mont-d'Or
and
Count Niwatori
, and she revealed that the explosion that caused the castle to collapse came from the Tamatebako.
When Mont-d'Or promised Morgans that the Big Mom Pirates would execute the
Straw Hat Pirates
and put their heads on display, Stussy commented on how vulgar their intentions were.
As the chaos in
Totto Land
further intensified, Stussy and Morgans snuck away from Whole Cake Island.
While leaving the island in a hot air balloon with Morgans, he overheard the latter encouraging Luffy to escape, prompting Stussy to comment that the journalist was on his side. Morgans then told her of his belief that the next Pirate King would come from the
Worst Generation
.

Nefertari Vivi
objected and then demanded that the agents release Shirahoshi. At that moment, CP0-group saw how
Neptune
was preparing to attack them, so Charlos ordered CP0 to kill him, to which Lucci agreed. However,

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
CP0 en route to Egghead.
Sometime after, the three agents received the mission to return
S-Bear
to
Egghead
and eliminate Vegapunk and his six satellites without damaging his inventions,
after which they would await the arrival of
Admiral
Kizaru
.
As they sailed to the island, Stussy heard Kaku explain to Lucci why Vegapunk had divided his mind into six individuals. After discussing this, Lucci wondered about a connection between Vegapunk's murder and the destruction of the
Lulusia Kingdom
, so both Stussy and Kaku advised him not to get involved.
When they reached the shores of Egghead, the three agents put on their masks and stepped out onto the deck of the ship. After destroying one of the
Sea Beast Weapons
and requesting access to the island, the CP0-group were informed that
Jewelry Bonney
was heading to the island, to which Lucci ordered them to kill her on sight.
Pythagoras
then contacted the agents and thanked them for returning S-Bear, before asking them to leave, as the Seraphim could return alone. However, when Lucci asked Pythagoras about the disappearances of the
CP5
,
CP7
, and
CP8
agents sent to Egghead,
Lilith
interrupted by threatening them. In response, Lucci ended the conversation and ordered ordered that they would use S-Bear's
powers
to reach the island, while the ship would be destroyed by Sea Beast Weapons.
Once all this was done, the agents along with the S-Bear arrived at Egghead, panic quickly spread around them. After a mechanical dragon approached them, Kaku attempted to attack it, but Stussy told him that it was just a hologram, prompting annoyance from Kaku for not telling him sooner. Following Lucci pointing out that she seems to know a lot about Egghead, Stussy responded that she was nostalgic being back on the island. When Kaku tried to fly to Labophase to look for Vegapunk, Stussy informed Lucci about the protective network called Frontier Dome surrounding it. Just as Kaku was attacked by said system, she advised them not to underestimate the world's greatest scientist, causing Lucci to ask if it wouldn't have been better to tell her first. At that moment, Kaku declared Stussy to be a bad person, who sarcastically asked if he has warmed up yet.
Immediately afterward,
Atlas
angrily ran towards them, and Stussy recognized her as one of Vegapunk's satellites. She watched as Lucci easily defeated the satellite. Luffy and some of the Straw Hats then ran into the agents.
Kaku warned Lucci not to attack Luffy, as the latter was now an Emperor, so they would need permission from the higher authorities to confront him. Stussy agreed because the slightest confrontation with an Emperor could lead to a war, so she ordered some agents to contact the
Marines
. However, Lucci ended up confronting Luffy, because the latter was upset by what he did to Atlas.
S-Bear attacks CP0
Suddenly,
Sentomaru
arrived with three more Seraphim:
S-Hawk
,
S-Snake
, and
S-Shark
. When Kaku ordered S-Bear to destroy one of them, Stussy pointed out that they are at a disadvantage, due to having less authority compared to Vegapunk's bodyguard. Sentomaru had the Seraphim attack the government agents. While they were attacked, Stussy explained to Kaku how the Pacifists' hierarchy of authority worked, mentioning that not even the
Five Elders
could control them if it was through a
Den Den Mushi
. Kaku replied that even if they destroyed the Seraphim themselves it would only cause casualties to the World Government. However, Lucci incapacitated Sentomaru, which gave them control of the Seraphim.
Immediately afterwards, Kaku and Stussy continued to watch the duel between Lucci and Luffy, who suddenly began to spin like a whirlwind. At the same time, when the Seraphim decimated many agents, Stussy commented on how strong they were even though they were still children.
CP0 with command over the Seraphim and ready to invade the Labophase.
Later, when Lucci recovered from his defeat against Luffy, she told him that they had to wait for the marines as ordered. However, Lucci responded that all the targets would have already escaped, so the CP0 agents, along with the Seraphim under their command, prepared to continue their mission.
When Lucci was wondering how to get past the Frontier Dome, Stussy asked him if he was serious about ignoring the Marines, which Lucci confirmed, saying that he does not recognize Luffy as an Emperor.
Shortly after, Vegapunk contacted her, asking her to help him escape. Stussy accepted the request, replying that she was waiting for his orders. Suddenly, the Frontier Dome was disabled, so Kaku told them it was their chance to attack. Although both Lucci and Stussy found it strange that it was now deactivated, believing it to be a trap, the three of them headed there using Geppo. When Stussy noticed the
Thousand Sunny
, Lucci ordered it to be destroyed. However, Kaku's attempt to do so was stopped by
Roronoa Zoro
.
Just then the Seraphim joined them despite having been given no order by CP0. During Kaku's fight against Zoro, Stussy bit Kaku's neck, putting him to sleep. When Lucci noticed this, he asked her in bewilderment what she was doing, so she stated that she only put him to sleep, expressing the intention of putting him to sleep as well.
Stussy subdues Lucci.
Lucci then attacked her with a Shigan but she dodged it. After taunting him, Stussy then nullified his powers with a piece of
Seastone
before biting his neck, making him faint as well. She admitted that Lucci and Kaku were too strong for her to fight directly. She then contacted Vegapunk and confirmed that she had taken care of both agents. However, she pointed out that she could not stop the Seraphim from attacking the Labophase since her authority was the same as Lucci's, but
Edison
informed him not to worry about that. After the latter succeeded in ordering the Seraphim to stop, Stussy informed Vegapunk that she had bound Lucci and Kaku with Seastone. Vegapunk invited her to leave Egghead with him and the Straw Hats, to which she agreed.
Stussy's group searching for Vegapunk.
Later, Stussy, Zoro, and Brook put on new outfits and joined the rest of the satellites as well as the Straw Hats in the control room of the Labophase. When Stussy asked about Stella,
Shaka
informed everyone about the situation: Vegapunk's main body had disappeared and the Frontier Dome was no longer responding to commands, so the group was trapped in the laboratory. Worried about Vegapunk, Stussy joined the search for the scientist, and Sanji asked her to take him with her.
She accompanied
Jinbe
and Sanji to the second floor of Building B, where the latter flirted with her, to which Stussy simply asked him to continue searching for Vegapunk. When Jinbe commented on how big the place really was, she explained that weapons were developed there, so there was no need to break anything.
Once the Seraphim began attacking the Satellites and pirates, Sanji ran off to protect
Nami
.
Stussy called Sentomaru on a Den Den Mushi and informed him that Admiral Kizaru was heading to Egghead as part of the mission CP0 had. When Sentomaru noticed how seriously the World Government was taking him, Stussy said it was because they considered it worse than the
Ohara Incident
; explaining that Vegapunk had continued the
archaeologists
' research and Egghead also has military defenses that
Ohara
did not have. After Sentomaru said that those reasons were enough, Stussy told him to contact her by Den Den Mushi since Labophase's communications systems were destroyed.
Stussy saves Vegapunk.
After Vegapunk was found and
York
was revealed as the culprit and was captured, Stussy reunited with the others in the Labophase. She enumerated to Vegapunk the marine forces surrounding the island, while Sanji offered her a cup of tea. She then realized that Lucci was looking at her, so she asked him not to.
When Kizaru arrived at the Labophase, Stussy noticed when Lucci tried to kill Vegapunk, so she jumped in front of the scientist, taking the full force of Lucci's Shigan in his place, falling to the ground spitting blood.
Upon recovering, Stussy remained in the Labophase to disable the Frontier Dome at the right time for the Straw Hats and the rest to escape. Suddenly, she and Kaku, who was in a seastone-coated bubble, saw an
Itsumade
firing a beam that destroyed part of the laboratory, with whom she began chatting with York before flying out of the place. Immediately afterwards, Stussy was relieved that they were not discovered, where Kaku asked her if she knew what that creature was. Stussy told him that judging from the conversation, he was one of the Five Elders, to which Kaku replied that that was what he was thinking and commented on how terrifying such a transformation was. At that moment, Kaku mocked Stussy for being left behind by her allies, finding ironic after her own betrayal, but she retorted it was of her own volition to stay behind and allow for them to escape.
Shortly after, Edison contacted her and told her to lower the barrier and escape immediately, but Stussy refused because she had to keep the barrier up so the Straw Hats could escape. However, Edison told her that this would be useless as the Five Elders managed to pass the barrier easily, further stating that they had already helped the crew enough, trusting that the pirates would manage without help afterwards. Stussy was relieved to hear this, believing that Stella would hate her if this did not happen, so Edison assured her that it would never happen and again demanded that she escape from there. She, however, claimed that she had no one to live for with Vegapunk dead.
Suddenly, she felt a strong tremor, so she asked Edison the reason, to which the satellite informed him of the terrible situation: the bottom of the Laphose had fallen on Fabiriophase along with the Cipher Pol agents; emphasizing that because of this he will no longer be able to create more clouds for the Straw Hats to escape. When Stussy then asked the reason for this, Edison informed him that it must have been one of the Five Elders, thus he asked the woman to escape. The latter asked to free Kaku, as she does not want her former partner to suffer the consequences of this event, promising that she would ensure that he does not go after the Straw Hat crew. Edison accepted Stussy's wishes and apologized for making her turn against CP0, as he knew the woman had come to see them as friends. Additionally, the satellite told him that her inner turmoil was proof that she was a human being and he wanted her to find a way to continue living, which Stussy acknowledged through tears.
After this, she lowered the barrier just in time for the Straw Hats to cross.
Sometime after, Stussy freed Kaku from the seastone-coated bubble and allowed him to regain his bearings. Despite her kindness toward him, Kaku bluntly refused her offer of friendship, stating that he had only seen her as a respected and cold-blooded associate. He went on to warn her of Lucci's impending fury toward her for her betrayal, reminding her that he would have no way to stop him from attacking her. She then quietly and tearfully made her exit.
After the Egghead Incident, other Cipher Pol agents asked Lucci for Stussy's location and he claimed to have killed her.
