Biography
[
]
Russian with her husband and son.
Russian and Senor Pink encountered each other on the streets while waiting for the rain to stop. They continued to see each other and eventually fell in love. They got married and had a son named Gimlet, and shortly afterwards Senor Pink left to raid with the Donquixote Pirates, although he lied to her and told her he was a banker.
During that time Gimlet died of a fever, and Russian found out that Pink was not a banker after she called the bank that Pink was supposedly working for. She left him in disgust despite Pink's efforts to explain things to her, and also despite of the storm that was currently happening. Russian was later caught in a landslide. This put her in a
vegetative state
; the doctors predicted she might not become normal again and that she might no longer able to express her feelings to anyone, and then worried about how long she had left to live. Pink was saddened by this; nevertheless, he never stopped visiting Russian frequently at the hospital and tried hard to make her smile again. This became a success after Senor Pink put on Gimlet's bonnet and pacifier. Senor Pink was first shown wearing these clothes during the takeover of
Dressrosa
, so it can be assumed that these events happened between ten and sixteen years ago.
She passed away an unknown number of years after entering her vegetative state.
