Minotaurus
is one of the five
Jailer Beasts
in
Impel Down
and the first one to appear. He is an
"awakened" Zoan
Devil Fruit user who ate a fruit that allows him to turn into a Holstein cow.
Due to his actions, he can be considered a supporting antagonist of the
Impel Down Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
In his Zoan form, Minotaurus is a minotaur with cutesy eyes, large lips, and a runny nose. His body pattern resembles that of a
Holstein Friesian
cow.
He wears striped pants, a leather belt with a bronze hoof shaped belt buckle, but no shirt. He is often seen with a spiked club that he uses.
Before his appearance was fully revealed, he had been seen as a silhouette and appeared extremely savage and truly demonic due to his actions. Like the other Jailer Beasts, Minotaurus has a comical and harmless appearance, despite his true power and personality.
Personality
[
]
Despite his appearance, Minotaurus is a cold-blooded beast. He would brutally bludgeon rioting prisoners and opponents alike with his spiked club. He would often do so aimed at their skulls. Because of his savagery, the various prisoners of Impel Down fear him, like the Jailer Beasts.
He acknowledges Sadi's superiority in battle, even fearing her when she got angry over his failure.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of the Jailer Beasts of Impel Down under
Sadi
, Minotaurus is in charge of torturing and maintaining various prisoners.
Physical Abilities
[
]
While he does not look like a powerful opponent, Minotaurus is in reality a fearsome beast. He has immense physical strength and speed, along with excellent resilience.
Weapons
[
]
He wields a spiked club as a weapon in conjunction with his strength and speed.
Devil Fruit
[
]
He has eaten an as-of-yet unnamed
Zoan
type Devil Fruit that allows him to become a cow. Because he is an "
Awakened Zoan
", he is able to recover rapidly even after suffering high amounts of damage.
While Awakened, Minotaurus fell victim to the Awakening's power, turning him into a near mindless beast.
History
[

Summit War Saga
[
]
Impel Down Arc
[
]
It is first seen beating two prisoners up for fighting and locking them up in a cell for death row, then again beating
Jinbe
in Level 6. Although only its shadow is shown during those times, it is clear that it is a Minotaur that shows no fear. Although at the time, Jinbe was chained down and Jinbe also states that it did not hurt him.
Later as
Luffy
reached the Starvation Hell of Impel Down, it got the order to battle him as well as Bentham, who was supporting Luffy. However, as soon as it sent Bentham flying with a single hit, Luffy recognized its true powers and immediately activated
Gear Second
and used his Gomu Gomu no Jet Bazooka to send Minotaurus flying to save Bentham.
Although Luffy used one of his powerful techniques to defeat Minotaurus, it appeared later, hunting
Buggy
and Galdino (it landed on top of them when Luffy sent it flying). At one point they come to meet Luffy and Bentham. Buggy used his secret weapon, the
Muggy Ball
, to take Minotaurus down, but even after a huge explosion it was still conscious. Even when Bentham used a strong kick to finish it off, it stood still but was in great pain. Only as Luffy and Galdino combined their abilities to use Gomu Gomu no Tonkachi Rifle, they could fully defeat Minotaurus. He was last seen falling from Level 3.
Later, he fully recovered (albeit bandaged) and joined the battle against the rioting prisoners.
Despite all of this, he was defeated (as well as receiving his comeuppance for beating Jinbe earlier) with the rest of the Jailer Beasts by Monkey D. Luffy,
Crocodile
and
Jinbe
in Level 1.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, the spikes on his club were sharp like nails, but in the anime the spikes are edited into flat, round spikes, due to the spikes being related to the theme of torture. Also, in the anime, Minotaurus has an extra battle with Luffy alone, where it was quickly defeated with a single Jet Pistol.
