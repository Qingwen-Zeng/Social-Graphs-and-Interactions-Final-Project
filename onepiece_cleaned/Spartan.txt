His attire consists of a orange
paludamentum
, a pair of studded wristbands, dark briefs, and black boots.
Personality
[
]
He is a very aggressive individual who dislikes idle spectators who only come into the Colosseum to look around, He does not hesitate to use force and intimidation to eliminate anyone he dislikes before the matches. He is quick to judge, as when he first saw Luffy (as Lucy), he immediately considered him a weakling who was unworthy to compete in the Colosseum.
He also seems to be a cruel person, as he was said to have bullied
Rebecca
in the past.
Despite his cruel actions, he showed a redeemable side to himself when he aided the other gladiators in providing Luffy enough time to regain his Haki and defeat Doflamingo.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Spartan is powerful enough to win the fighting tournaments fifty-one times within the high-caliber Corrida Colosseum, though he was utterly no match for
Luffy
.

Dressrosa Saga

Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Spartan is easily defeated by Luffy.
When
Monkey D. Luffy
(under the disguise of "Lucy") joined the tournament to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
, Spartan first appeared in the waiting room angry at Luffy, thinking he was just a weak boy who came just to look around, not knowing his identity as the infamous pirate. Although the other tournament players tried to stop him, he attacked Luffy, who dodged the punch and grabbed his hand, lifting him high and flipping him down into the ground, hard. He was then knocked out while the others were left shocked at Luffy's strength.
Luffy was going to get disqualified by the colosseum's staff for presumably starting a fight, but the
Chinjao Family
stood up for him and pointed Spartan as the one who should be disqualified from the tournament.
After
Doflamingo
initiated his
Birdcage
and was nearly defeated by Luffy, Spartan and the other gladiators from the Colosseum provided their aid to Luffy after he became exhausted. The gladiators tried attacking Doflamingo, but they were easily defeated.
However, they bought enough time for Luffy to recover, enabling him to defeat Doflamingo and bring down the Birdcage.
