Koza defeats Agotogi.
When Vivi was on her way to a
Sand-Sand Clan
meeting, Agotogi and his bandits intercepted her to try to kidnap her. The Sand-Sand Clan attacked them, and Koza told Vivi to run away.
Agotogi and his men defeated the Clan while Vivi ran to nearby ruins. Agotogi pursued her, but Koza knocked him off the top of a broken wall by hitting him over the head with his club. Koza tried to protect Vivi at all costs, but Agotogi slashed Koza's face with his knife. However, Koza ended up beating Agotogi by striking him in the face. An unconscious Agotogi laid on the ground as two of his men threatened to kill Koza, but
Cobra
showed up and kicked them away. The rest of Agotogi's bandits were defeated by
Pell
and
Chaka
