Appearance
[
]
Orlumbus is a huge man that resembles a stereotypical pirate captain. He has a deep frown and thick chin with stubble. He wears his long blond hair in braids with four slung over his shoulder. He has a large, masculine upper-body and a small lower-body with small legs.
He wears a bicorn with a small skull on the front over a black bandanna with orange spots. There are four braids coming down from his hat, it is unknown if it his hat or his hair (like
Buggy
). He wears a buckled strap over his bare chest under a navy blue (red in the anime) naval long-coat.
Personality
[
]
Orlumbus seems to be quite self-confident, since he held up the defeated
Fighting Lion
to show everyone his strength.
He seems to be really committed to protocol as he stays on schedule, keeps everything tidy, and is always ready to give out orders, even to enemies (who in actuality follow them before realizing he is about to attack them).
Unlike most of the people who were released from
Sugar
's curse, Orlumbus is not shown to be swayed by greed as he chose to engage the
Donquixote Pirates
instead of their enemies. After
Doflamingo
was defeated, Orlumbus became very loyal to
Luffy
and pledged the allegiance of his fleet to help the
Straw Hats
in the New World.
Orlumbus is a dedicated scholar. Even as a child, he enjoyed studying, and in his adulthood, he has a collection of books for his leisure.
Orlumbus can be compassionate as he gave supplies to the citizens of the poor country he tried to raid.
It appears that Orlumbus is prone to exaggerating his exploits. While others refer to him as the "Made-Up Explorer",
he calls himself the "Pioneer Explorer" instead.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
He is the admiral of a fleet numbering approximately 4,300 soldiers and 56 ships, showing tremendous leadership capability. His strength allowed him to be considered one of the favorites to win the last D-block. To prove it, the spectators who witnessed this block considered the idea that he could be defeated by
Rebecca
impossible, which in fact did not happen.
Orlumbus is also an expert scholar as he is very orderly and has a fair collection of books in his possession.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Orlumbus has enormous physical strength, as he could lift a lion with just one hand and also squeezing it.
During the fight against the Donquixote Pirates, Orlumbus could effortlessly throw Zoro all the way from the Flower Hill (turned into the New King's Plateau by Pica) to the Old King's Plateau with astounding velocity. He is also left handed.
He also possesses great stamina, as he bounced back immediately after being hit by
Lao G
, a powerful martial artist. Even after being scratched by a lion, he only sustained a minor injury and didn't flinch at all.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Orlumbus was born in a poor family in the Standing Kingdom and he was an avid reader and scholar. At some point, he did something that made him known as the "Made-Up Explorer".
Some time after this event, the king of the Standing Kingdom supposedly made him an official explorer, making him an admiral and giving him command over a massive fleet which would later come to be known as the
Yonta Maria Grand Fleet
. After this, Orlumbus officially began traveling the seas as an adventurer. With his ability to command such a large fleet so skillfully in the New World, he earned the epithet, "Massacre Ruler". The fleet continued to gather fame during their travels to the point where it has been said that those who could manage to sink it would be able to make a name for themselves which consequently boosted Orlumbus' already rising reputation even further.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Orlumbus and the rest of D Block is defeated by Hakuba.
Orlumbus entered the
Corrida Colosseum
to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
.
For the battle royale, he was placed in D Block.
As D Block's battle royale began, Orlumbus was seen preparing to fight, glaring fiercely at his competition.
He later defeated the
Fighting Lion
.
When
Cavendish
's alter-ego Hakuba suddenly surfaced, he proceeded to strike down all the remaining fighters in D Block. Orlumbus fell victim to his attack and was defeated.
Sometime after D Block, Orlumbus was
transformed
into a
toy
and forced to work in the underground trade port. When
Sugar
fell unconscious, he returned to his original form.
After Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his "Birdcage", Orlumbus and the other Colosseum fighters escaped to the surface through an opening created by
Pica
when he rearranged the land with
his ability
.
Orlumbus with Luffy, Zoro, Law, Ucy and the other Corrida Colosseum combatants are on their way for Doflamingo.
When he found
Luffy
,
Zoro
, and
Law
, Orlumbus stated that he will take
Doflamingo
's head. Therefore, he joined forces with Luffy's group alongside the
Chinjao Family
,
Hajrudin
,
Suleiman
,
Ideo
,
Ucy
,
Blue Gilly
, Cavendish,
Abdullah
,
Jeet
,
Elizabello II
, and
Dagama
. When some of the former toys came for the heads of Luffy, Zoro, and Law, Orlumbus and the allied Colosseum fighters fought them off. They later march towards the royal palace and began to battle against
Pica
, who appeared as a massive stone giant.
When Pica attacked, Chinjao and Elizabello II shattered his stone hand, enabling the group to move forward. Orlumbus and the other allied fighters fought through Doflamingo's troops. Pica then attacked with his other arm, causing Orlumbus and some of the other allies to fall back. After avoiding Pica's strike, they were surprised to see Luffy, Zoro, Law, Abdullah, Jeet, and Ucy climbing on Pica's arm. They were also amazed when Luffy shattered Pica's stone head. When Pica's giant stone body stopped moving, Orlumbus and his allies continued on with their assault.
Orlumbus was then seen reaching the first level of the King's Plateau, together with the other colosseum fighters.
With Zoro fighting Pica and Sabo fighting the
Marines
, the Colosseum fighters charged up the new King's Plateau and easily defeated the
Donquixote Pirates
' troops standing in their way. They later reached the first level and got ahead of Luffy.
Lao G attacks Orlumbus.
After reaching the second level, the Colosseum fighters were confronted by four of the Donquixote Pirate officers. During the skirmish,
Lao G
punched Orlumbus in the face. The Colosseum fighters later banded together to create an opening for Luffy and Cavendish.
Orlumbus helps Zoro defeat Pica.
Orlumbus was shown to still be active in the fight later, engaging the numerous Donquixote Pirates' troops rather than an officer. The adventurer later assisted Zoro by forcibly getting a group of enemies to stand in formation using an as-of-yet unknown technique and strike them down with another foot soldier in a fashion similar to bowling. Orlumbus then stated that he would leave Pica to Zoro.
When Pica was heading towards the Old King's Plateau in the giant Pica statue, Orlumbus assisted Zoro by throwing him towards his adversary, enabling Zoro to defeat Pica.
After witnessing Pica's defeat at the hands of Zoro, he was seen grinning at the victory.
When the Birdcage started shrinking, Orlumbus was told by
Sai
to wake up their fallen allies before the Birdcage reaches them.
After
Mansherry
healed
the injured, the gladiators defeated the remaining Donquixote Pirates on the New King's Plateau to help the citizens flee from the shrinking Birdcage.
Using
Bartolomeo
's
barrier
, the gladiators worked together in pushing the Birdcage back.
Once Luffy finally defeated Doflamingo, the gladiators witnessed the collapse of the Birdcage.
Three days after Doflamingo's defeat, the Marines were mobilized to pursue Luffy and his allies. Orlumbus utilized his Yonta Maria Grand Fleet of 56 ships to assist the Straw Hats and their allies in escaping Dressrosa. Orlumbus allowed them to board his flagship, the
Yonta Maria
. Orlumbus, along with his 4,300 crewmembers, asked to join Luffy's pirate alliance.
When Luffy was asked to perform a
sakazuki ceremony
to complete the agreement for an alliance, Luffy declined, much to the others' shock. Once Luffy explained that they can do whatever they want, the allies decided to forge the alliance anyway, forming the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
. Sai, Bartolomeo, Leo, Cavendish, Ideo, Orlumbus, and Hajrudin sat down and drank their sake cups. Afterwards, they held a feast to celebrate their victory over Doflamingo.
After the feast, Orlumbus and the other leading allies received Luffy's
Vivre Card
and parted ways.
Whole Cake Island Saga

The Stories of the Self-Proclaimed Straw Hat Grand Fleet
[
]
After parting ways with the other members of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, Orlumbus and his fleet set out to sea. Orlumbus then spoke to the king of the
Standing Kingdom
and resigned as an adventurer.
Orlumbus' first "pirate act" is to help a poor city by giving them supplies.
Orlumbus later started his day as a pirate at 6 AM by folding his pajamas. At 10 AM, Orlumbus checked the cleaning of his ship. Orlumbus then bid the Standing Kingdom farewell as the king and his army assaulted his stolen fleet with cannon fire. After leaving the kingdom behind, Orlumbus began writing a piracy plan. Sometime later, Orlumbus and his fleet began attacking an island. However, after finding out that the citizens were poor, Orlumbus decided to give them supplies.
Afterwards, Orlumbus and his fleet left the island.
