Pekoms
is a
combatant
of the
Big Mom Pirates
and a lion
mink
.
He is partnered with
Tamago
, and both are responsible for collecting the monthly payment of sweets from
Fish-Man Island
in exchange for
Big Mom
's protection.
Pekoms originally sailed the seas under
Pedro
as a member of the
Nox Pirates
before he and some of the crew joined the Big Mom Pirates.
During the
Whole Cake Island Arc
, he betrayed the crew in an attempt to help
Monkey D. Luffy
escape
Totto Land
and honor Pedro's self-sacrifice.
Appearance
[
]
Pekoms is a
mink
resembling a humanoid maned lion. He is relatively tall, as he appears about one head taller than the 5'11
Sanji
. Because of his beady eyes, people often consider him to be cute when he removes his sunglasses, even when threatening someone. He often holds his fists up in a confrontational manner and hangs his tongue out of the side of his mouth. Despite having large paws for hands, his feet are evidently small enough to fit into the small boots he wears.
He wears a pink suit, black sunglasses, a silver earring on his left ear, a sword on his right hip, and wears black high-heeled boots with white ruffled brims.
He also wears a salmon-colored dress shirt underneath his suit jacket.
Five years ago, he wore the same outfit as his current appearance but with a white inner shirt.
When disguising himself as "Nazoms", he donned a dark version of his outfit and wore a luchador mask over his head, which has a star between two small horns depicted at the front.
When in his Sulong form, Pekoms' eyes turn blue, his mane and tail tassel grow tremendously in size, and his body grows thicker and more muscular to give him a more feral appearance.
Personality
[
]
Pekoms has a short temper, as seen as when he was in a fit of rage when he was first introduced. He lifts up his sunglasses while threatening people, but because of his "cute" beady eyes, he does not look frightening. Like many other members of the crew, he seems terrified of Big Mom.
He also has a liking for chocolate, and is willing to admit that to people.
He carries around a list of bounties on wanted people such as pirates and takes note of the people he has seen on bounty posters, as seen when he took the time to look up Caribou even when the latter was about to fire at him with a Gatling gun. He acknowledges that merely possessing a Logia-type Devil Fruit does not make the user invincible, commenting that anyone who thinks so will have a swift downfall.
He has some level of pride in his own Devil Fruit abilities, as he expressed mild disappointment that Luffy did not react to his
fruit
's defensive capabilities being likened to diamond.
He also has a strong attachment to his
former home
as shown when he offered to let the Straw Hats go when he found out they saved the
Mink Tribe
from
Jack
. He was even willing to lie to
Big Mom
to help them.
He was also willing to capture his own crewmate
Charlotte Brûlée
in order to honor Pedro's sacrifice for the Straw Hats.
According to Wanda, he used to be known as a delinquent on Zou.
According to Jinbe, he has a strong sense of duty, as he refused to aid Bege in his scheme to kill Big Mom.
While grumpy with a ferocious temper, Pekoms genuinely cares for the people he is close to, as shown when he broke down crying when Pedro was almost killed by Big Mom's life span absorption powers.
Like several members of the
Mink Tribe
, Pekoms has a quirk related to the behavior of the animal he resembles. In his case, he adds a roar ("gao") to the end of most of his sentences.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Pekoms is deeply afraid of
Big Mom
, and fears her so much that he hesitated in answering a phone call from her.
However, when the Emperor was about to take Pedro's life, Pekoms begged her to spare his friend, and so she did.
Pekoms apparently respects
Tamago
as his crewmate and partner, as the two of them get along relatively well. They are tasked with collecting the monthly candy tribute from
Fish-Man Island
for Big Mom. Despite their partnership, Tamago has no regrets over abandoning Pekoms on Zou, saying
Capone Bege
did the right thing.
However, after learning that Pekoms survived, Tamago hoped that he could get a pardon for him.
Because of his devotion to the Big Mom Pirates, Pekoms refused Bege's offer to take part in his scheme to assassinate Big Mom.
He also did not disclose Big Mom's scheme to assassinate the Vinsmoke Family including Sanji to the Straw Hats because of his loyalty.

However, after Pedro sacrificed himself for the Straw Hats, Pekoms decided to betray the Big Mom Pirates in order to assist Luffy. The crew showed no mercy to Pekoms for his betrayal and attempted to brutally gouge out his eyes to disable his Sulong form.
Enemies
[
]
Capone Bege
[
]
Pekoms addressed Bege as a newcomer when the two were sent together on
Zou
. It seems like Bege does not care much about Pekoms as he shot him in the back after seeing that Pekoms is willing to let his personal feelings get in the way of their mission. Bege also told him that they no longer need someone like him,
leaving him behind without a second thought.
While recovering from his wounds, Pekoms told the Straw Hats that he intends to settle things with Bege once he fully recovered.
Upon returning to Whole Cake Island, he was captured by Bege's crew where Bege offered Pekoms to join him in his schemes to assassinate Big Mom. Pekoms refused the offer and, to prevent his plans being leaked, Bege ordered his men to put Pekoms in chains and took him to a cliff over shark infested waters, where he was shot over the edge by Bege.
Jack
[
]
Due to
Jack
destroying his hometown, Pekoms holds deep resentment for the pirate.
Mink Tribe
[
]
Pekoms has an amiable relationship with his fellow minks as he was terribly shocked when he found his homeland in ruins and overjoyed when he found his fellow minks alive and well. The minks, in turn, welcomed him back with open arms
and took care of him after Capone Bege wounded him.
Sworn Brothers
[
]
Pedro was the only person who could calm Pekoms in his Sulong form.
He was extremely close with his sworn brothers
Pedro
and Zepo, having once traveled together with them in search for the poneglyphs. After their defeat in Totto Land, Pekoms was devastated when Zepo was killed by Big Mom and tearfully begged the Emperor for Pedro to be spared, allowing him to leave with his life.
As the Sanji Retrieval Team was departing Zou, Nekomamushi said that Pedro was the only one who could keep Pekoms in line and Pekoms seemed rather uneasy of Pedro tagging along.
However, Pekoms still cared a great deal about Pedro, as after Pedro seemingly sacrificed himself to give the Straw Hats a chance to escape, Pekoms was crying non-stop as he grieved over his presumed death.
Pekoms' respect for Pedro is so great that he is willing to betray the Big Mom Pirates by helping Luffy escape from Totto Land to honor Pedro's sacrifice.
His bond with Pedro was so strong that Pedro was the only person who could calm Pekoms' rampage in his Sulong Form.
Family
[
]
Pekoms greatly cares about the safety of his family members; in particular, his parents. His father is a monkey mink and his mother is a bear mink. When he arrived back on Zou and saw the city in ruins, he exclaimed that his heart nearly stopped.
Pekoms' Father.
Pekoms' Mother.
Others
[
]
Fish-Man Island
[
]
In spite of Pekoms' tendency to issue obvious threats, the citizens of Fish-Man Island consider him to be "cute" rather than intimidating. Pekoms did not show any concern with the civil war that Fish-Man Island had to contend with. When the
Minister of the Left
explained to him about how the
Candy Factory
was damaged during the coup of the
New Fish-Man Pirates
, Pekoms just states that the
Big Mom Pirates
are not responsible for the civil war and expects the citizens to fulfill their payment.
In spite of Pekoms' coldness towards Fish-Man Island, the citizens showed genuine concern for him when he was gunned by Caribou only to realize that his status as a fighter for one of the
Four Emperors
is well-deserved once he retaliated and quickly defeated Caribou.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Pekoms shows his gratitude towards the Straw Hats for helping the Mink Tribe.
When meeting Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji on Fish-Man Island, he was angered by the Straw Hats eating his captain's candy.
Later, when he encountered them near
Dressrosa
, he and the rest of his crew attacked them in an effort to capture
Caesar Clown
.
During the failed attack, the Straw Hats escaped, but the Big Mom Pirates heard of their destination and followed them to Zou.
When he saw the results of
Jack
and the
Beasts Pirates
' attack, he suspected the Straw Hats. However, after hearing the full story, he thanked them and offered to lie to Big Mom to let them escape in exchange for Caesar Clown, despite Bege's protests.
Upon meeting Luffy again, Pekoms did not hesitate to explain the circumstances of Sanji's arranged marriage.
Despite his gratitude towards the Straw Hats, he still considers them enemies due to Luffy challenging Big Mom, and did not take it kindly when Luffy said that he felt Big Mom should be his underling, not the other way around. He was also annoyed that Luffy ignored his objections to taking him with him back to Big Mom's base.
His annoyance with Luffy was shown further when Luffy was not impressed with his diamond-like defense and when Luffy ridiculously carried him like a backpack, calling him the 'Worst Savior Ever'.
Nevertheless, Luffy considers Pekoms a friend, going so far as wanting to punch Bege for attempting to kill him. After Pedro sacrificed himself to help the Straw Hats, Pekoms chose to honor his wishes by assisting them.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
He, along with
Tamago
, is responsible for collecting the candy payments Big Mom demands from the islands under her protection.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Pekoms has proven himself to be extremely agile as shown when he dodged the slash of
Caribou
's scythe. Pekoms instantly disappeared like a
Soru
user and retaliated just as quickly. He has extreme superhuman strength as he knocked out Caribou, who is a new super rookie with a bounty of
210,000,000, with a single Haki enhanced punch, breaking the latter's weapon in the same instant.
The tremendous force of his punch sent Caribou flying back in the process.
As a member of the
Mink Tribe
, Pekoms is a born warrior who can use
Electro
.
Sulong Form
[
]
Pekoms' mid-transformation.
As a mink, Pekoms is capable of transforming into a
Sulong
form by gazing at the full moon. In his Sulong form, his natural fighting abilities are significantly increased. However, this increase in power did not prevent Pekoms from being overwhelmed by an army of several thousand Big Mom Pirates.
He also has difficulty controlling his Sulong form, with only the words of Pedro being able to break him out of his mindless ferocious state.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Kame Kame no Mi
Pekoms' defensive turtle shell.
Pekoms ate the Kame Kame no Mi, a
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a full turtle and a mink-turtle hybrid at will.
His turtle form gives him a protective shell around his torso, which he can sink his head, arms, and legs into. The shell is very resilient, allegedly hard as diamond, as it took many bullets from a Gatling gun and did not show any signs of damage afterwards.
It also allowed him to survive the majority of Bege's assault to his back, showing his quick reflexes to transform in time.
Haki
[
]
Armament Haki
[
]
Pekoms is skilled in
Armament Haki
, which he used to strike Caribou, a Logia user, incapacitating him in one hit.
Observation Haki
[
]
Pekoms possesses the ability to use
Observation Haki
.
Weapons
[
]
He carries a sword,
although he has not been seen using it. When he betrayed his crew in order to help Luffy escape from Cacao Island, he briefly wielded a flintlock but did not fire it.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Pekoms was born on
Zou
27 years ago.
During his younger years, he was an infamous delinquent.
He once sailed the seas as a member of the
Nox Pirates
under
Pedro
13 years before the start of the series. They were initially explorers in search of a
poneglyph
, but their activities gained the attention of the
World Government
and earned them bounties.
The crew became more injured and discouraged as the years went on, and Pekoms led everyone except Pedro and
Zepo
in a withdrawal from the crew, as they could no longer continue on. Pekoms' group arrived at
Big Mom's territory
, where they were saved, and they joined the
Big Mom Pirates
.
Ten years after they had first started sailing, Pekoms reunited with Pedro and Zepo after they infiltrated Totto Land. Pekoms later watched as
Big Mom
passed judgement on Pedro and Zepo after the pair were defeated and captured. Zepo was forced to spin a roulette wheel to determine how much lifespan they would lose, which resulted in Zepo's death. With a considerable amount of lifespan left to be taken from Pedro, Pekoms tearfully begged Big Mom for mercy, and she obliged by cutting ten years off Pedro's sentence, allowing Pekoms' former captain to survive.
As a member of the Big Mom Pirates, he was partners with
Tamago
for many years.
Fish-Man Island Saga
[
]
Fish-Man Island Arc
[
]
Pekoms strikes Caribou with a Armament Haki empowered punch.
On
Fish-Man Island
, Pekoms threatened the citizens about their candy tribute, but seemingly failed to realize that the citizens were more enamored than frightened due to his cute beady eyes.
After hearing about
Monkey D. Luffy
eating the candy, he called
Bobbin
and told him about the situation. Pekoms then talked to Luffy about the candy, but Tamago interrupted him. When Big Mom called Fish-Man Island, Pekoms was too scared to answer the
Den Den Mushi
and was deeply shocked that Luffy answered the call himself and deliberately infuriated Big Mom.
Before leaving Fish-Man Island with the island's treasure, he was attacked by
Caribou
who wanted his treasure back, as he stole it first. Caribou first attacked with a gatling gun from
his swamp body
, but Pekoms
turned into a turtle
and used his natural shield to protect himself. After Pekoms reverted to his normal form, Caribou tried to slice him with a scythe, but Pekoms defeated him with a single punch, breaking the scythe and hitting Caribou. After commenting that a
Logia
Devil Fruit
user's belief in their own invincibility is also their downfall, he left the island with Tamago.
Dressrosa Saga

Punk Hazard Arc

Tamago and Pekoms watching Caesar's broadcast of his weapon.
Pekoms and Tamago watched
Caesar Clown
's broadcast from
Punk Hazard
via video Den Den Mushi about his
weapon of mass destruction
.
Pekoms was surprised that
Law
, Luffy,
Nico Robin
, and
Smoker
were captured by Caesar.
After watching Caesar's defeat, he roared as Tamago told him to report the incident to Big Mom.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Later on, Pekoms, Tamago, and other members of Big Mom Pirates pursued the
Thousand Sunny
while those on board (
Sanji
,
Nami
,
Tony Tony Chopper
,
Brook
, and
Kouzuki Momonosuke
) were attempting to return to
Dressrosa
. Pekoms revealed that their target was Caesar, and when he confirmed Caesar was aboard the Sunny, he was prepared to attack in order to claim him.
During the pursuit, Pekoms, Tamago, and
Capone Bege
were surprised that the "Curly Hat Pirates" (those on board the Sunny, under Sanji's de facto captaincy) were able to successfully fight back and escape.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Zou Arc
[
]
Pekoms is shot in the back by Bege.
Two days before Luffy's group reached Zou,
Big Mom's ship
arrived at Zou after following the Curly Hat Pirates. Nami revealed that the Big Mom Pirates overheard the name of the Curly Hat Pirates' destination after they left Dressrosa. Following this, Pekoms informed Big Mom that he would pursue them and retrieve Caesar, because Zou is his homeland and he knew how to reach the island.
When Pekoms, accompanied by Capone Bege, disembarked, he was shocked to find his homeland in ruins in the aftermath of
Jack
's attack. However, he was overjoyed to find that his fellow minks were safe, and he was informed that the Straw Hats were the ones who treated them and thereby saved their lives. In gratitude, Pekoms agreed to forego an unnamed mission which would have proved disastrous for the Straw Hat crew, as long as the Curly Hat Pirates agreed to hand over Caesar. Annoyed that Pekoms was letting his emotions overrule their mission, Bege shot Pekoms in the back.
Although Bege severely wounded the unsuspecting Pekoms, Pekoms was still able to activate his Devil Fruit and block about half of the attack's damage.
When
Nekomamushi
arrived and questioned why Pekoms was injured, Bege was forced to retreat, leaving Pekoms behind.
Pekoms was then taken in by Nekomamushi.
When Luffy and his group arrived on Zou, Luffy went to see him to question him about Sanji's arranged marriage to
Charlotte Pudding
. Sharing his knowledge of the
Underworld
, Pekoms revealed to Luffy and Nami that the marriage was arranged by Big Mom and
Sanji's father
, and that the
Vinsmoke Family
is a family of notorious Underworld killers.
Luffy forces Pekoms to bring him to Big Mom's tea party.
Pekoms further proceeded to tell them of the organization known as
Germa 66
, revealing that it was run by the Vinsmokes, much to Nami's disbelief. Luffy then interjected, stating that while he did not care whether or not Sanji got married, he would not allow the marriage to force the Straw Hats into becoming Big Mom's underlings. He proposed that the Big Mom Pirates work under
him
instead. Outraged at this statement, Pekoms reminded Luffy of Big Mom's power and status, explaining why Sanji could not refuse the wedding invitation. If he did, he would be sent a box containing the decapitated head of someone close to him. Pekoms went on to explain that the Straw Hats would not have to become Big Mom's subordinates, because the wedding's purpose was political, designed to bring together the Vinsmoke and Charlotte bloodlines. However, once the marriage was finalized, Sanji would automatically cease to be a member of the Straw Hat Pirates. Pekoms finally revealed that he would return to the Big Mom Pirates once he had sufficiently recovered. Luffy then told Pekoms to bring him to Sanji, ignoring Pekoms' objections to bringing someone intent on undermining the wedding.
Pekoms is tied to Luffy's back as the Sanji retrieval mission begins.
During Jack's second attack on Zou, the house Pekoms was resting in collapsed. When Luffy checked up on him, Pekoms revealed that he used his Devil Fruit powers to save himself from further injury. Luffy then carried Pekoms on his back and departed Zou with the Sanji Retrieval Team. Pekoms was deeply shocked when Luffy jumped off
the giant elephant
with his party in tow.
The Sanji Retrieval Team is forced to eat Luffy's "Random Curry."
Pekoms rested on the Thousand Sunny's deck after the fall as they sailed towards
Whole Cake Island
while
Carrot
revealed herself, having sneaked onboard the ship.
The Sanji Retrieval Team learned from a newspaper about the
Blackbeard Pirates
' attack on the
Revolutionary Army
's headquarters on
Baltigo
, surprising everyone on board. After passing through a storm, Luffy presented his cooking, which the group did not enjoy in the least. Luffy then admitted that he used up all the food they had and the group found themselves in a food shortage crisis.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Marine Rookie Arc
[
]
After the team ran out of food, they began to get very hungry. They spotted
Fron Island
in the distance and prepared to look for food there, but Pekoms warned them that it was home to a Marine base. He and Pedro stayed behind to guard the Thousand Sunny while the others traveled to the island on the
Shark Submerge III
.
A few hours later, the others returned to the Sunny with a massive food stockpile, but Pekoms and Pedro ate most of it in 10 minutes due to being left starving on the ship.
Concludes non-canon section.
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
A few days later, the group was famished from the lack of food and overheated as they passed through boiling waters. They were saved from starvation when Luffy managed to catch
a gigantic fish
. As they entered Big Mom's territory, Pekoms informed the group about warning waves that are sent to ships entering Big Mom's waters. When a ship approached the Sunny, Pekoms and the Sanji Retrieval Team were shocked to find that the ship belonged to Germa 66.
The Sanji Retrieval Team encounters Sanji's sister, Reiju.
The crew met
Sanji's youngest brother
, and tensions grew between them until
Sanji's sister
arrived and healed Luffy. Pekoms told the group that the reason Big Mom wanted Germa 66 as her allies were because of their advanced technologies. When Yonji asked Pekoms why he was with the Straw Hats, Pekoms replied that he had his own reasons. The two groups then parted ways.
The group later docked at
Cacao Island
, an island with buildings made of chocolate. While speaking to a guard, Pekoms claimed to have captured the Thousand Sunny and told him not to report to Big Mom, also claiming to have a surprise for her. Pekoms then told the crew that it would take a day to reach Whole Cake Island. When Carrot noticed people from different races living on the island, Pekoms explained Big Mom's dream of creating a nation where people from all races can live together. He also revealed that Cacao Island is one of 34 islands that surround Whole Cake Island and they are collectively known as Totto Land. He decided to remain with the ship because he would be easily recognized but asked for a chocolate souvenir. After hearing that Luffy and Chopper went ahead to explore the island, Pekoms was furious when they quickly got themselves in trouble.
Bege shoots Pekoms into the ocean.
Before the Sanji Retrieval Team returned to the ship, Pekoms was abducted by the
Fire Tank Pirates
, but left behind a message telling Luffy's team to turn back.
Bege offered Pekoms a chance to become an accomplice in his scheme to assassinate Big Mom, but Pekoms refused.
At the northeastern coast of
Whole Cake Island
, Pekoms was chained and taken to the edge of a cliff by Bege and his crew. Right after Pekoms warned Bege that underestimating Big Mom would be his downfall, Bege shot Pekoms, causing him to fall into the shark-infested waters below.
However, before Pekoms met his demise, he was rescued by one of the
Sun Pirates
and he informed
Jinbe
of Bege's treachery.
Pekoms' injuries are treated by the Sun Pirates.
At the eastern side of Whole Cake Island, Pekoms was being watched by
Charlotte Praline
and the Sun Pirates. Pekoms asked if Jinbe reported Bege's treachery to Big Mom and
Aladine
responded by saying he did. However, Pekoms was suspicious with how they were acting, but Jinbe's crew insisted that he rest.
When the wedding started, the Sun Pirates tied up Pekoms to a rock as they prepared to depart Whole Cake Island.
He later escaped from his restraints and returned to Sweet City. After the Whole Cake Chateau collapsed, Pekoms informed the Charlotte Family about the Sun Pirates' departure before being informed by them about the events that transpired at the wedding.
After hearing about how Pedro saved the Straw Hats, Pekoms grieved over Pedro's presumed death.
Pekoms was later surprised to hear that the territorial sea slugs went missing.
Pekoms goes against his own crewmates to help Luffy escape from Cacao Island.
Wanting to honor Pedro's wishes, Pekoms decided to aid the Straw Hats in their escape, and so he found and captured
Charlotte Brûlée
in order to help Luffy escape from the Mirro-World. Disguising himself as "Nazoms", he approached Luffy after the Straw Hat captain defeated
Charlotte Katakuri
and told him of his intentions.
Pekoms took Luffy and Brûlée to the mirror leading to Cacao Island, saying he would go on a rampage in his Sulong form even though he would not have Pedro to get him out of it. Pekoms carried Brûlée in front of him, and sandwiched Luffy between himself and Brûlée in order to hide the Straw Hat. He came out to Cacao Island and held Brûlée hostage with a flintlock as he activated his Sulong form. However,
Charlotte Oven
heated up the flintlock, taking Pekoms aback and causing him to expose Luffy. Despite his increased abilities, Pekoms was quickly overwhelmed by his crewmates, who decided to gouge out his eyes to deactivate his Sulong form. However, the skirmish was then interrupted when
Germa 66
arrived at Cacao Island and attacked the Big Mom Pirates.
After the Straw Hats escape, Pekoms is not seen again, leaving his fate unknown.

Anime and Manga Differences

As Sanji and Luffy were fleeing through the air in the manga during their escape from Cacao Island, Pekoms was subdued when the Big Mom Pirates restrained him and attacked him while he was down. In the anime, the Big Mom Pirates do not pin Pekoms to the ground and he fights the male decuplets as they were attacking Sanji in the air. After he fends off the males, the female decuplets attack him but are beaten back as well. However, Pekoms loses control and slams Sanji into the roof of a building, but manages to regain control of himself afterwards and tells Sanji to flee with Luffy. Pekoms continues attacking his former allies until Raisin strikes him. Pekoms then loses consciousness after the Big Mom Pirates pierce him with spears.
