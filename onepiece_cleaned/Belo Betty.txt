is the current
commander
of the East Army in the
Revolutionary Army
following the death of the previous commander,
Ginny
.
Appearance
[
]
Betty is a tall, slim woman with fair skin, short, purple hair stylized in a bob cut. Her pale green eyes are usually covered by a pair of black-framed sunglasses with red lenses and tiny white spots at the bottom. She also wears red lipstick and is usually seen smoking a cigarette.
She wears a red top hat with red goggles, a pair of red curled horns on the front, and a long and puffy white plume on the back. She wears a red tie and her torso is barely covered, as she leaves her cropped red jacket with pink outlines open. She has red and white striped stockings under her red thigh-high boots. Her frilly red skirt is short on the front and long at the back. She also carries around a large flag with the Revolutionary Army's symbol on it.
Four years ago, Betty's hair was long instead of a bob cut. She wore a revealing shirt and did not have her sunglasses or the curled horns on her hat.
Personality
[
]
Betty treats the people she helps very rudely, insulting them and only referring to them with degrading terms, which was why
Kuma
let her take Ginny's position as East Blue Commander, due to their similar personalities. Despite this attitude, her intention is still to recruit them into the Revolutionary Army by encouraging them to make their own choices. She believes that committing heroic actions is a decision one makes for themselves. When the people of
Lulusia Kingdom
took up arms and fought, she broke her normal attitude briefly to commend them on their actions. Despite her rude and disrespectful attitude, she does share with her fellow executives the same feelings of mercy and a desire to help those who are in trouble. Also, she does show respect and appreciation to those who stand to fight their own enemies and troubles, as she warmly smiled and proudly praised the people of Lulusia Kingdom for standing up and fighting the Peachbeard Pirates.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a Revolutionary Army executive, Betty is in a powerful position within the organization. As commander of the East Army, she has control over all the soldiers in it. The
World Government
has given her a
bounty
of
457,000,000, proving that she is a significant threat to their operations.
Betty is an extremely charismatic orator. With her Devil Fruit powers, she inspires numerous people to fight. Morley called Betty the flag bearer of freedom for her skills.

Further information:
Kobu Kobu no Mi
Betty uses her power to encourage the citizens of the Lulusia Kingdom.
Betty ate the Kobu Kobu no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to encourage and rally people into fighting, increasing their resolve and physical strength in the process. She activates her power by speaking encouraging words to her targets.
Once someone has been encouraged, this power will keep their fighting spirit going for quite some time, though it is unknown how long this power actually stays in effect or if it even has a time limit at all.
Her power is effective enough that she was able to turn the scared helpless citizens of the Lulusia Kingdom into a fighting force strong enough to successfully beat back the invading
Peachbeard Pirates
with only sticks.

When the other revolutionaries were celebrating the news that Sabo was still alive, Betty found the noise annoying and told them to quiet down. As Dragon went to interrogate Kuma, Sabo called the other revolutionaries
and denied killing Cobra. Sabo attempted to report what he had seen in Pangaea Castle, but the World Government cut off the signal and destroyed the Lulusia Kingdom.
Later, the revolutionaries were in the middle of repairing Kuma when he stood up of his own accord, ran to the coastline,
