Stalker was first seen on the Marine warship going to Impel Down with
Boa Hancock
. After the stowaway
Monkey D. Luffy
yelled out "I'm stuffed". Stalker thought it was Hancock, and since the other Marine soldiers thought that Hancock would not be so unladylike, they bet that if it was her, they would all get
mohawk hairstyles
. When Hancock embarrassingly took the blame, the Marines shaved their heads to get mohawks.
