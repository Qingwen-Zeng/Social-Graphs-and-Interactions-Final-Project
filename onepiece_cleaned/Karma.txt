Karma
is an
octopus
fish-man
and the captain of the
Takotopus Pirates
, an infamous
New World
pirate crew subordinate to the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Karma is an octopus fish-man whose most distinctive trait is the large dark pink octopus he wears on his head and his six arms, but unlike
Hatchan
and
Octopako
, his arms lack suction cups nor does he have an elongated mouth. He has a red circle right in the middle of his forehead and a black goatee. He wears a striped shirt with ripped sleeves, a standard pirate's sash and loose pants similar to
Buggy
's
Thirty years ago, he did not yet have a goatee and he wore a shirt with a stylized kanji "цен" which means "karma".
Personality
[
]
Karma was once a cruel man, willing to capture humans, such as
Kouzuki Toki
, to sell for a profit.
However, it remains unclear if he is still involved in this trade after he became a subordinate to
Whitebeard
.
Since he refers to Whitebeard as "Pops" and came to Marineford in order to save Ace, it is assumed that Karma has a strong bond with the Whitebeard Pirates.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Karma is a fearsome pirate who has managed to make himself an infamous reputation in the New World and ally himself with the Whitebeard Pirates. He avoided injuries from the war. He is an experienced veteran being active for more than 30 years. As a fish-man, Karma can breath underwater and possesses at least ten times the strength of the average human. As a veteran pirate of the New World, he is most likely even stronger then the average fish-man.
Weapons
[
]
Karma wielding his swords.
With his multiple arms, Karma is capable of wielding a total of six
sabers
, similar to
Hatchan
's
Six Sword Style
.
It can be assumed that he is a capable
swordsman
, and the fact that he can use six weapons at the same time helps him greatly in battle.
In the anime, he was shown capable of clashing swords with
Kouzuki Oden
(while wounded though), indicating a high level of swordsmanship.
History

Past
[
]
In the past, Karma and
his crew
were kidnappers. Thirty years ago, his crew tried to capture
Toki
on a certain island to sell her. His crew was then scared off by
Kouzuki Oden
, who they had mistaken for an umibozu, and so they went to get their captain for help. When Karma returned, he threatened to sell them both, but before he could act, he was swiftly knocked out by
Whitebeard
.
Sometime later, Karma allied his crew as subordinates to the
Whitebeard Pirates
.
Summit War Saga

Marineford Arc
[
]
Karma's ship.
When
Portgas D. Ace
was to be executed at
Marineford
, Karma and his crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
to save him. Karma and his fellow allies attacked the
Marines
outside of the bay and later managed to enter it. At
Epoida
's side, Karma was surprised to hear that
Monkey D. Luffy
's father was the revolutionary
Monkey D. Dragon
.
Later, Karma followed
Whitebeard
's orders in attacking Marineford from the side instead from the front.
When
Fleet Admiral
Sengoku
put his plan into motion, Karma and his crew were attacked by the
Pacifista
army. After
Squard
stabbed Whitebeard and claimed that he sold out his allies to save Ace, Karma began to doubt Whitebeard. While he was fighting against Pacifistas, Karma even turned toward the
Emperor
to ask him if all that was true or not.
When Whitebeard showed his selflessness by giving the pirates an escape route, Karma's loyalty to Whitebeard was renewed.
After the siege wall was raised and
Admiral
Akainu
melted the ice with
his magma powers
, Karma boarded Whitebeard's hidden ship and entered the plaza with the help of
Little Oars Jr.
. After Luffy saved Ace from the second execution attempt with his
Supreme King Haki
, Karma and the other pirates supported Luffy on Whitebeard's orders. Luffy managed to free Ace on the scaffold, and the pirates rejoiced. When Squard wanted to sacrifice himself in order to help the pirates escape, Karma was one of the ones who told him not to do it. Just when the pirates were about to leave with Ace, Akainu provoked Ace and took his life. When the admiral aimed for Luffy's life, Karma and the other pirates made protecting Luffy their top priority. After
Shanks
arrived and called for a ceasefire, Karma and the other pirates left.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga version of Whitebeard and Ace's funeral, Karma cannot be seen among those in attendance.
However, the anime version of the exact same scene explicitly shows Karma alongside the other attendees.
Although it can be assumed that Karma was at the funeral, there is no visual evidence of his attendance in the manga to support this assumption and, as such, his attendance can only be considered non-canon.
