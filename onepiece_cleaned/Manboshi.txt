Manboshi
is an
opah
merman
and the third son of the royal
Neptune Family
on
Fish-Man Island
.
Appearance
[
]
Manboshi is a rotund, stocky and large merman (shown when he spoke with Madame
Shyarly
). Like his brothers, he has a polka dot tail, with a black variation along with white polka dots and red scales. He also has brown hair and red fins on his head.
He wears a blue hat with a dirty white stripe going across the middle of it. The stripe is serrated on the bottom side and there is a dot pattern inside the stripe. He also wears a yellow sash, like his two older brothers.
When he and his family arrived at the
Red Port
for the
Levely
, he wore a dark shirt.
Personality
[
]
Manboshi is perhaps the most energetic among his brothers. He talks in song, and has a habit of saying "Akkamanbo". It appears he can be rather unpredictable, as he asked
Ryuboshi
to dance with him in the middle of looking for the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Like
Ryuboshi
, he sings when he talks, except he does not sing in scale. His habit of singing came from his effort to cheer his sister up to protect the Fish-Man Island from her powers.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a prince, he has some royal authority granted to him. Along with Fukaboshi and Ryuboshi, Manboshi is one of the three most powerful warriors of the Neptune Army. The
Minister of the Right
claimed that the Straw Hats would be in trouble if they were confronted by Manboshi and his brothers, however the minister underestimatedÂ the Straw Hats. Further testament to his strength is when he, along with his brothers, took down the sea beasts that easily defeated the rest of the Neptune Army including the two ministers. The
New Fish-Man Pirate
officers also had to take at least two
Energy Steroids
to defeat him and his brothers.
Weapons

Further information:
Merman Gujutsu
He has been seen wielding a massive, Medieval-style
longsword
, and possesses great skill in wielding it, dispatching a large group of drug-enhanced sea monsters with his brothers in mere seconds. In the anime, the sword was destroyed by
Daruma
.
History

Past
[

Manboshi and his siblings after their mother returned home from preaching.
As a child, he and his brothers would look after their then baby sister,
Shirahoshi
whenever their mother,
Otohime
, was away preaching to the people of
Fish-Man Island
.
When Shirahoshi was six-years-old, a World Noble arrived on the island in a wrecked ship. Otohime quickly dashed off to where the ship was docked. The four children of the royal family soon followed her.
When Otohime was threatened by the noble she was protecting, Shirahoshi cried and unknowingly called out
Sea Kings
. The World Noble passed out from a big shock and Manboshi and his brothers tried to calm Shirahoshi.
When Otohime decided to accompany the noble to the surface, Manboshi and his siblings looked worried. For one week, they anxiously waited in
the castle
for her return. After Otohime returned safe and sound, she finally reached out to the citizens and collected their signatures. Manboshi, his siblings, and
Neptune
were overjoyed by Otohime's success.
Otohime later explained to Manboshi and his brothers about
Shirahoshi's ability
to call Sea Kings, which is connected to a legend. She went on saying that Shirahoshi's ability could be dangerous since she could not control it yet. Otohime then asked the three brothers to become strong warriors and protect Shirahoshi.
Manboshi and Ryuboshi try to cheer up Shirahoshi after Otohime's death.
One day in
Gyoncorde Plaza
, the box containing all of the signatures suddenly caught fire. In the confusion, Otohime was shot. Manboshi and his brothers immediately came to their mother's side. The three brothers tearfully listened to their mother's last words, telling them not to be angry for her sake and to look after Shirahoshi. They then noticed that Shirahoshi was about to scream. Manboshi and
Ryuboshi
remembered what their mother said about what could happen if Shirahoshi calls Sea Kings again and how an emotional shock could trigger it. The two brothers then started singing and dancing in a desperate attempt to raise Shirahoshi's spirits and keep her from crying out, much to everyone's confusion and annoyance. As their mother passed away, Manboshi and his siblings touched pinky fingers with her for the last time.
Before Otohime's funeral, the four children of the royal family told their father about the love letters that kept flying to Shirahoshi. Neptune told Manboshi and his siblings to not to go out to the funeral since danger still lurked around. During Otohime's funeral, Manboshi and his siblings were seen on a visual broadcast as
Fukaboshi
gave his speech.
Fish-Man Island Saga
[

Fish-Man Island Arc
[

He and his two older brothers went to
Mermaid Cove
, investigating the illegal entry. At one point, he yelled for everyone to start dancing, wishing to join in with the mermaids frolicking. He was stranded at Mermaid Cove after the
Straw Hat Pirates
took the royal gondola. He and his brothers talked to the mermaids about why they were looking for the Straw Hats. The reason was that they had to deliver a message from
Jinbe
.
Later, he and his brothers were concerned about
Madame Shyarly
's prediction.
At the entrance gate to Ryugu Palace, Manboshi was concerned for his sister and father's safety after hearing about the Straw Hats taking over the palace.
Some time later, he and his brothers watched
Hody
's speech to Fish-Man Island through a visual broadcast. He was furious to hear Hody's plan to take over and rebuild the
Ryugu Kingdom
with himself as the ruler. He was shocked and worried when Hody showed the chained up king. Hody announced that he would execute the king at
Gyoncorde Plaza
.
The brothers take down the sea beasts.
After Hody finished his speech, Manboshi and his brothers rode on their gondola and headed for the plaza to save their father even though it might be a trap. On the way there, Manboshi stated that he understood why Jinbe was always keeping on eye on Hody and why pirates were not visiting the island recently. He and Fukaboshi then discussed the Straw Hat Pirates. Fukaboshi said that he was worried about Madame Shyarly's prediction, but he did not feel any ill-intent from them at all. Manboshi commented on how he felt the same way since the mermaids form Mermaid Cove, who already met the Straw Hats personally, did not speak ill of them at all and that the mermaids' eyes are capable of seeing through anyone. Manboshi soon arrived at Gyoncorde Plaza with his brothers and wondered why the soldiers started fighting without them. He and his brothers then attacked and easily defeated the drugged
Sea Beasts
. Manboshi then declared that they choose a future of love with mankind and would defeat the
New Fish-Man Pirates
. Manboshi and his brothers then charged at the officers.
Manboshi with his father and brothers, all chained up and on display for execution.
Initially, the princes had the upper hand, but the officers turned the odds against them by taking
Energy Steroids
. The princes were then defeated and captured. When Hody wondered about the current status of Princess Shirahoshi, Manboshi yelled at Hody not to lay a finger on Shirahohsi, saying that she was no threat to him. Hody then stated that he knew about the Mermaid Princess of legend. After Shirahoshi,
Megalo
, and Jinbe were captured and brought to the plaza, Hody revealed to everyone that he was the one who truly killed Otohime. Manboshi was stunned at this revelation. Shirahoshi said that she already knew about it thanks to Megalo and she did not tell anyone because she was honoring her mother's last wish of holding no hatred for the killer. As Hody mocked Shirahoshi for allowing him to go free, he attacked the royal brothers and Neptune with Yabu Same. Shortly afterward, Manboshi, his father, and his brothers were rescued by
Hoe
during the Straw Hats' unexpected arrival.
When Shirahoshi tried to swim away from Fish-Man Island as
Vander Decken IX
had thrown
Noah
towards her, Manboshi went after her together with his brothers. They came to Shirahoshi's aid at the instant when Decken threw knives at her. Manboshi and Ryuboshi blocked the knives and then tried to lead Shirahoshi to safety. After Hody impaled Decken and took him out of the fight, he went after the princess using
Fish-Man Karate
and Manboshi blocked the attack, leaving him heavily wounded.
Decken was still alive, but fell unconscious and the ship started falling towards Fish-Man Island. Luffy later defeated Hody and the Sea Kings stopped Noah from falling. Manboshi and his brothers then took Hody and Decken to the plaza and put them in chains. While the officers and Decken were imprisoned, the royal family and the Straw Hats had a feast at Ryugu Palace as a celebration. Later, after being informed about a strange occurrence in the dungeon, Manboshi went with his father, brothers, the ministers, and Jinbe down to the dungeon to see that the imprisoned officers had become frail, old men.
Afterwards, Manboshi and the people of Fish-Man Island bid the Straw Hats farewell as they set sail for the
New World
. Manboshi thanked them for everything while stating that their army would become more stronger than before. Manboshi and his brother promised their father that they would not forget the debt they owe to the Straw Hats.

Levely Arc
[

As the Neptune Family prepared to depart Fish-Man Island, they received the news of the events that occurred at Totto Land.
The Neptune Family later arrived at the
Red Port
, and
Monkey D. Garp
escorted them to the bondola. As he and his family rode it to Mary Geoise, Manboshi was happy that Shirahoshi marveled at the sun and sky.
Manboshi and his family later reached the top of the Red Line and they made their way to the
Mary Geoise
castle. At the socializing plaza, Manboshi conversed with other royals.
Manboshi and his brothers later witnessed Charlos' attempt to enslave Shirahoshi.
After Mjosgard stopped Charlos, Manboshi stood beside his father as Mjosgard promised Neptune that he would protect Shirahoshi during the Levely.
Wano Country Saga
[

Wano Country Arc
[
]
On the fourth day of Levely, Charlos returned to the socialization plaza to try again to capture Shirahoshi, with the help of
Bartholomew Kuma
. Seeing this, Manboshi and his brothers attempted to rescue her, ignoring warnings that the World Nobles would destroy their country. After Fukaboshi clarified that they would never return, the three princes went to attack Charlos, but the latter made Kuma shoot them with a laser beam, although they managed to dodge it. When they were going to attack again, Mjosgard stopped them since they were royalty; telling them to leave it to
Sai
and
Leo
because they are pirates and have no affiliated nations. After these two hit Charlos,
Morley
of the
Revolutionary Army
grabbed Kuma off the ground to take him away.
When the Levely meeting was about to end, the three brothers wanted Shirahoshi to wait with them at Red Port so they wouldn't have to deal with the World Nobles anymore.
After the Levely ended, the Neptune Family returned to Fish-Man Island along with Garp. While at the Ryugu Palace, the latter and Neptune proceeded to talk about the Levely and the incident involving
Arabasta
after they left Mary Geoise.
