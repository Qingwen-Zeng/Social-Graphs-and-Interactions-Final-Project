Zeus the Thundercloud
is a
homie
that is fused with
Nami
's
Sorcery Clima-Tact
. Before merging with the Clima-Tact, he was owned by
Big Mom
, who would summon him from her left hand.
Due to being made from a
soul fragment
from Big Mom herself,
he is more powerful than most homies.
He was created by Big Mom in her youth, and served her into old age as one of her personal weapons alongside
Prometheus
and
Napoleon
. During the
Straw Hat Pirates
' escape from
Totto Land
, Zeus was captured by the Straw Hats and forced to become Nami's servant.
He lived inside her Sorcery Clima-Tact for a brief period until he was reclaimed by Big Mom in
Wano Country
.
However, Big Mom later abandoned Zeus for good after he had struggled during the battle at Onigashima, replacing him with another homie named
Hera
. She attempted to remove her soul fragment from him,
but he survived the ordeal by permanently fusing with Nami's Clima-Tact as a vessel.
Zeus then joined Nami for good, this time as her partner.
Appearance
[
]
Zeus normally appears as a large and light-colored cloud. When he caused a storm, he becomes dark and produces lightning crackles (pink in the anime while controlled by Big Mom, yellow in the anime while controlled by Nami).
He also wears a striped red and blue (red and white in the anime) baseball cap with a yellow brim on his head.
He usually has a carefree, sleepy expression, but can take on a more sinister appearance.
When he was initially described by
Pound
, he lacked the baseball cap and most of his facial features.
After being sliced in half by
Brook
and then drained of electricity by
Nami
, Zeus's size was greatly reduced, enough to be held in one hand, and his face was enough to cover much of his body.
During the
raid on Onigashima
, Zeus wore a blue kabuto helmet when he appeared alongside the other Straw Hats.
Zeus as the Sorcery Clima-Tact.
After fusing with Nami's Sorcery Clima-Tact, Zeus's face can also appear in the middle of the Sorcery Clima-Tact's hilt, maintaining a dopey expression with blush marks. His face can also be transferred to the orange appendages at the end of the Clima-Tact whenever he causes them to grow, and he can also transfer his consciousness to the weather phenomena created by the Clima-Tact.
However, he mainly continues to assume his cloud form.
Personality
[
]
As one of her personal weapons, Zeus was very loyal to
Big Mom
and would come to her when she summoned him. Zeus also seemed to care about the safety of the citizens in
Totto Land
and hated to see them be tormented during Big Mom's rampages, but unlike his fellow homies, Zeus knew it was futile to try and reason with Big Mom when she is on one of her rampages.
However, despite his loyalty, Zeus shares her extreme gluttony and particularly enjoys eating thunderclouds. Zeus was willing to disobey direct orders from Big Mom as long as
Nami
kept feeding him
thunderclouds
. However, he is capable of reason and learning from his mistakes, as he became very angry when Nami tried feeding him again, though his anger made him open to attack.
His loyalty to Big Mom does not come before valuing his own life, as when Big Mom ordered
Hera
to consume him, he begged to be allowed to leave in peace rather than surrender his soul power to Hera. He went as far as to assist Nami after feeling betrayed by Big Mom, and was willing to attack his master as a means of apology towards Nami for his earlier betrayal.
He is also extremely carefree, as after he became Nami's servant, he readily accepted it and found it comfortable to be stored inside her Clima-Tact.
Relationships
[
]
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Because they interfered with Big Mom's interests, Zeus was initially an enemy of the
Sanji Retrieval Team
. After
Luffy
defeated
Charlotte Cracker
, Zeus joined the assembled army to avenge him.
When
Brook
tried to steal a copy of
Big Mom
's
poneglyphs
, Zeus fought alongside Big Mom and the rest of her special homies and attacked him.
As the team was pursued by the Big Mom Pirates after they escaped
Whole Cake Island
, Nami and Brook used Zeus against Big Mom by forcing him to discharge all his power. When Zeus was greatly weakened, Brook captured him and Nami coerced him into becoming her servant.
Nami
[
]
Nami holding Zeus.
After the Straw Hats escaped from Totto Land and Nami revealed that she keeps Zeus in her Clima-Tact, it was shown that Zeus apparently did not mind working for Nami.
However, when Big Mom was later able to use her power to regain control of Zeus, Nami stated that their friendship was over.
When Zeus was searching for Big Mom and saw Nami on the way, she lived up to her previous declaration and gave him the cold shoulder. However, when she saw how cruel Linlin was in discarding Zeus, she pitied him and tried to empower him with her clouds, only for Hera to intercept.
Thankfully, her actions allowed Zeus to survive by becoming one with her Clima-Tact, though when he saw she still did not forgive him for his earlier betrayal, he started making it up to her by helping her take down
Ulti
for good.
Nami was able to forgive Zeus for his earlier actions and though she declined Zeus' offer of him becoming her servant again, she made a better proposal of Zeus becoming her partner instead.
Nami has shown to be quite possessive over Zeus, showing a habit to hold and tightly grip him, becoming quite angry if he shows any form of disloyalty to her, causing Zeus to be quite afraid of her at times.
Big Mom Pirates
[
]
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Big Mom with her special homies.
Being a special
homie
, Zeus is loyal to Big Mom and the
Big Mom Pirates
.
While Big Mom experiencing one of her food cravings, Zeus was shown caring for her well-being as well for Sweet City.
Zeus was also shown to be vengeful towards those who upsets Big Mom.
According to
Charlotte Perospero
, Zeus is responsible for carrying Big Mom overseas.
Like most individuals, Zeus was shown to be afraid of Big Mom's rage.
When Big Mom and her children arrive at Wano Country, Big Mom openly stated her intentions to take Zeus back, and ultimately succeeds, threatening Zeus with death if he went easy on Nami.
Later, during the fight against the Worst Generation at the rooftop of the
Skull Dome
, Big Mom became extremely angry with Zeus, calling him useless after he was trapped by Kid and Law inside a box, preventing him from saving Big Mom when they managed to throw her off the roof.
After he was freed from the box, Zeus immediately set off to find Big Mom, unaware of her fury towards him and that she had already replaced him with a new homie called
Hera
.
Upon finally reaching Big Mom, Zeus was heartbroken to see Hera alongside the other special Homies, which was only compounded when Linlin declared she no longer needed Zeus, and even went as far as to offer his life and soul fragment to his successor. This callous treatment led him to rebel against his creator in order to create an opening for the Straw Hat Pirates to escape.
Despite what had happened, Zeus still cared for his former master when he briefly cried for her upon learning of her defeat to
Trafalgar Law
and
Eustass Kid
, before Nami reminded him that she is no longer his master.
Prometheus and Napoleon
[
]
Zeus' fellow special homies seem to get along together and fight well in sync with each other.
However, when he was distracted and then used by
Nami
,
Prometheus
was shown to treat Zeus harshly.
When Zeus was trapped by Kid and Law inside a box, preventing him from saving Big Mom from falling off into the ocean, both Prometheus and Napoleon called Zeus useless and stated that he was always holding them back, convincing Big Mom to replace him with Hera.
Neither Napoleon nor Prometheus showed any regret at Zeus being disposed of by Big Mom and Hera.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Zeus is far more powerful than normal
homies
, being made from a fragment of
Big Mom
's very own soul. This gives the cloud a will strong enough to resist the soul projection of the
Yomi Yomi no Mi
's user.
However, he can still be harmed by the user's attacks, as shown when Brook unleashed a powerful attack that sliced him in half, though Zeus was able to survive due to his composition.
As a cloud, Zeus can fly, produce both normal and "sweet rain"
(
水あめ
,
Mizuame
?
)
,
and attack with powerful bolts of lightning,
strong enough to defeat
Vinsmoke Judge
in one hit.
When combining powers with
Prometheus
, they can manipulate the weather to create incredibly vast and destructive thunderstorms.
Like
Prometheus
, Zeus is mostly immune to physical attacks due to being an intangible cloud, even attacks imbued with
Armament Haki
, being simply able to recombine his body. However, unleashing massive discharges weakens Zeus, decreasing his size until he can recharge by consuming electricity. It has also been shown that electricity-based attacks work well against Zeus due to his composition as a thundercloud; if someone unleashes electrical energy that combines with his, Zeus can be forced to unwillingly discharge his electricity, up to the point of harming his master Big Mom.
Zeus' attacks being lightning-based also means certain characters can resist them without much issue, such as
Monkey D. Luffy
, whose body is made of insulating
rubber
, and Brook, who has no flesh to be harmed by electricity to begin with.
Big Mom flying on Zeus.
He can also expand and serve as a seat for Big Mom, being made of more dense and tangible material similar to
Sea Clouds
.
Zeus can also carry objects and people while flying, as seen when he transported Pudding and Sanji to the wedding venue
and when he carried Big Mom to chase the Straw Hats, flying at incredible speeds, enough to catch up to the Straw Hats, who had a significant headstart, while carrying Big Mom.
Zeus transforming into a mace as part of Nami's Clima-Tact.
After his soul was transferred to Nami's
Sorcery Clima-Tact
, Zeus gained a wider breadth of abilities. He can manipulate the orange appendages on both ends and shape them as he pleases, having shown the ability to freely form it into weapons like a mace. This makes it similar to Napoleon's ability in manipulating the weapon's shape they inhabit. He can also inhabit weather phenomena that Nami generates from the Clima-Tact, allowing him to perform lightning-based attacks like he is used to if Nami generates a cloud using him. Although Zeus claims that his soul cannot leave the Clima-Tact without Big Mom's
ability
,
he is seemingly able to exist in cloud form without being tethered to it.
It is unclear whether he is limited to a certain range.

, literally meaning "Thunderbolt")
: Big Mom summons Zeus around her left hand, charging it with electricity, and then slams it down on her opponent, striking them both with her superhuman strength and a powerful bolt of lightning. It was first used against Vinsmoke Judge, and was powerful enough to knock him out in one hit.
This is called
Thunder Bolt
in the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations.
Indra
(
威鼓
,
Indora
?
, literally meaning "Mighty Drum")
: Big Mom makes Zeus shoot a lightning bolt at a distant enemy. It was first used against

Tenman Daijizai Tenjin
?
)
: Big Mom commands Zeus's lightning to strike through the clouds in all directions, bombarding her surroundings with an electrical thunderstorm. The lightning itself is sentient, and can change direction to strike at targets who are trying to dodge or take cover.

Zeus Breeze Tempo
(
ゼウスブリーズテンポ
,
Zeusu Burīzu Tenpo
?
)
: An unwitting attack forced by
Nami
. Nami feeds Zeus several
Black Balls
and a
Weather Egg
with a thunder cloud inside, causing him to grow to a massive size, before maneuvering her
Clima-Tact
to manipulate them from within Zeus (even against his will), to strike her target with a large lightning attack comprised of both her own and Zeus's full abilities. The force of the thunderbolt was enough to cause
Charlotte Perospero
to believe that Big Mom had annihilated the Straw Hats with it.
Ninpo: Raitei.
Ninpo: Raitei
(
忍法雷霆
,
Ninpō Raitei
?
, Meaning "Ninja Art: Thunderbolt")
: After summoning Zeus and feeding him a Weather Egg, Nami swings her Clima-Tact downward with Zeus following the movement and striking her target and surrounding area with a massive electric discharge. It was first used against
Kurozumi Orochi
.
It was also later used to defeat Ulti, successfully defeating the powerful Tobiroppo in one strike. Due to maintaining his cloud form in the midst of this attack, Zeus is capable of moving around and homing in on his target if it misses the first time.
It is called
Ninpo: Lightning Blast
in the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations.
Grow Up
(
成長
,
Gurōappu
?
, literally meaning "Grow to Adulthood")
: By incorporating the growth abilities of the
Pop Green
into the second model, similar to his own
Kuro Kabuto
, Usopp designed the new Sorcery Clima-Tact to also change size. Whenever Nami squeezes the handle she can extend the size of the staff, where the new length is determined by the amount of pressure that is applied.
Nami's first usage of this move as an actual method of offense was against
Charlotte Brûlée
, as an escape measure after the latter had Nami captured in her arms.
With Zeus's inclusion, the attack becomes even stronger, with him manipulating the size and shape of the Clima-Tact to deal heavier blows.

[
]
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Zeus danced with Big Mom alongside the other
homies
as she asked for a status report on the preparations for
Sanji
and
Charlotte Pudding
's wedding.
During Big Mom's rampage in
Sweet City
, Zeus told Prometheus that it was useless trying to talk to her during her tantrums, as she would not hear them.
Zeus and Prometheus create a storm.
When
Monkey D. Luffy
invaded Whole Cake Island and defeated Cracker, Zeus and Prometheus created a large storm of sweet rain as
Big Mom's army
attacked Luffy.
Zeus later returned to the Whole Cake Chateau, where he carried a
Den Den Mushi
on his back for Big Mom to speak through.
After Luffy challenged Big Mom during the call, Zeus asked her if she would get mad, but she replied that it was of no importance as she was too happy. However, when Big Mom got angry upon hearing that someone had broken into the Room of Treasure, Zeus became fearful.
Big Mom battles Brook with Zeus and Prometheus.
Big Mom broke into the Room of Treasure and summoned Zeus and Prometheus to help her battle
Brook
, whom they easily overwhelmed.
After Brook was defeated, Big Mom sat on Zeus as she caressed the Straw Hat.
Later on, Zeus accompanied Big Mom and Pudding inside the Queen's Chamber, and the latter sat on the cloud while conversing with her mother about the upcoming wedding.
Big Mom and her homies then went to bed, but as she slept, she spotted and swatted at a fly. Thinking there was an intruder in the room, Zeus, Prometheus, and
Napoleon
woke up and attacked the spot where Big Mom had swatted the fly before going back to sleep. Later, Zeus spotted
Carrot
approaching Big Mom and attacked her, thinking she was the fly.
On the morning of the wedding day, Big Mom was crying in grief when the skeleton she was carrying was not moving (not knowing that Brook was replaced). Zeus and Prometheus cheered her up by reminding her of the wedding.
They later accompanied her to the wedding venue as the
Tea Party
began.
Zeus and Prometheus celebrated during the tea party, and when the time came for a wedding ceremony to begin, Zeus transported Sanji and Pudding to the venue on a giant teacup.
When Luffy broke into the wedding venue, Big Mom summoned Zeus and Prometheus to her side in order to attack him. However,
Charlotte Katakuri
intercepted Luffy first.
Zeus strikes down Judge.
Later as the Vinsmoke Family battled against the Big Mom Pirates in order to provide an opening for Luffy and Bege's groups to escape, Zeus was going to be used to finish off
Reiju
after Prometheus failed to kill her. However, Luffy's Gear 3 and Sanji's
Diable Jamble
countered Zeus at the last second.
Vinsmoke Judge
then stepped in to fight Big Mom, and she had Zeus use Thunder Bolt to strike down Germa's king.
However, the
Tamatebako
fell to the foot of the Chateau and exploded, causing the building to topple over. Big Mom fell off the venue, and Zeus cushioned her before she hit the ground.
Nami uses Zeus' power against Big Mom.
After a craving Big Mom was told by
Perospero
that the Straw Hats had her desired wedding cake, she summoned Zeus, who quickly flew her to the Straw Hats' location.
After Big Mom launched her first attack on the Straw Hats,
Nami
released several
thunderclouds
in Zeus' direction, which caused him to veer off-course to eat them while dropping Big Mom to the ground. Zeus then caught up with the fleeing Kingbaum and asked Nami for more thunderclouds. Nami offered to feed him more if Zeus became her servant in return. This made Zeus start wondering if he should abandon Big Mom. When Big Mom ordered the tree homies of the Seducing Woods to stop the Straw Hats, Zeus noted on how angry Big Mom was.
Despite Big Mom's orders, Zeus continued to be coaxed on by Nami. However, he unwittingly ate her entire Weather Egg, causing him to balloon in size and cover the sky as he became stormy. Nami then used Zeus to strike Big Mom with a massive thunderbolt.
After Zeus returned to his normal size, Prometheus berated the cloud homie for his actions. Zeus apologized, saying he could not help it before commenting that he still thought Nami's clouds were delicious.
After Big Mom left Whole Cake Island to continue pursuing the Straw Hats, Zeus was at the western coast, wondering why nobody was there.
Zeus is bisected by Brook.
Later on, Zeus and Prometheus traveled over Totto Land's sea to reunite with Big Mom. They eventually returned to her, and they went to attack the
Thousand Sunny
.
As they attacked,
Jinbe
managed to knock Big Mom off the Sunny, but Zeus caught her. They headed back to the Sunny, and Zeus was presented with more thunderclouds by Nami. However, Zeus resisted the temptation and attacked her, but his attack hit Brook, who was immune to electricity. The skeleton sliced Zeus in half and Nami sent her thunderclouds in between Zeus' halves, causing him to discharge a massive amount of electricity that engulfed Big Mom. Zeus was greatly weakened and briefly knocked out, enabling Brook to bring him back to the Sunny. Nami then threatened Zeus, stating that she would kill him if he did not serve her.

Kurozumi Orochi
, unleashing a massive thunderbolt.
Big Mom regains Zeus.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Zeus joined the Straw Hats on the Thousand Sunny as they entered the battle with the Beasts Pirates.
When he was near Prometheus at Onigashima, it caused Nami's staff to react.
As Prometheus called Big Mom, Zeus fled with Nami and her group.
However, Big Mom was able to recapture Zeus and subdue Nami and Carrot.
After being brought to the Live Stage and later during the raid, Big Mom used her power over him to regain control and threatened to eliminate Zeus if he went too soft on Nami. Just as an angry Nami declared her friendship with Zeus over, Brook arrived and once again sliced Zeus in half with his sword.
Big Mom was later driven out of the castle by Jinbe and Robin, and she then clashed with
Marco
. When
Carrot
and
Wanda
arrived, Big Mom used Zeus to retreat from the area and go back to Kaidou's location.
Zeus gets separated and trapped away from Big Mom.
When Big Mom joined Kaidou on the rooftop of the
Skull Dome
, Zeus recharged to full strength by eating the lightning from the sky above Onigashima.
During the confrontation against Luffy,
Eustass Kid
,
Killer
,
Trafalgar Law
, and
Roronoa Zoro
, Zeus carried Big Mom and delivered devastating lightning attacks on the members of the
Worst Generation
.
However, during the fight, Zeus was
trapped inside
a metal box
by Kid and Law, preventing him from saving Big Mom when she was pushed off the rooftop as he desperately attempted to break out.
Later, when Big Mom's attack on Kid freed Zeus from the metal box, he immediately set out to look for and save Big Mom, but was teleported downstairs by Law's ability.
Crying, Zeus yelled that he would help Big Mom. When Sanji asked the cloud about Nami, Zeus was shocked and flew away faster.
Zeus has his soul extracted out by Big Mom.
Zeus eventually found Big Mom after she attacked
Page One
inside the Skull Dome.
Zeus approached her, seeing a new thundercloud homie named
Hera
and believing that she was an addition to their troupe. However, Big Mom informed him that Hera was his replacement and that his services would no longer be needed, and proceeded to have Hera eat Zeus to consume his soul. Zeus then saw Nami running nearby and called out to her, and even though she did not forgive him, he decided to make it up to her by attacking Big Mom. However, Big Mom easily grabbed him and sucked out much of his soul, rendering him weak enough for Hera to eat without resistance. Nami released some black lightning balls to power Zeus up, but he was unable to consume them as Hera chomped down on him and Nami's Clima-Tact.
Zeus merges with Nami's Sorcery Clima-Tact.
However, due to Zeus' soul being out of his body, it managed to end up being absorbed into the Clima-Tact rather than Hera. Upon fully manifesting in the weapon, Zeus greeted Nami and explained how he got there. The Tobiroppo
Ulti
then arrived, and as Nami tried to attack her with the Clima-Tact, Zeus shifted its appendage into a mace to strike Ulti in the head. Nami then hatched a stormcloud from a Weather Egg, and to her surprise Zeus inhabited the cloud as well. Nami then charged Zeus up to attack Ulti with
Raitei
, and although Ulti jumped out of the attack's path, Zeus changed direction and flew into her, engulfing her in lightning and knocking her unconscious.
Zeus then appeared in cloud form and though Nami had rejected his offer to becoming her servant again, she made a better offer of becoming her partner and Zeus, happy at this news, immediately attacked several Beasts Pirates members.
After hearing that Big Mom was defeated by Eustass Kid and Trafalgar Law, Zeus expressed sadness until Nami reprehended him.
When the entire
Skull Dome
was starting to get engulfed in massive flames, Chopper asked whether Zeus could use rain to put out the fire. However, Zeus responded that the fire was so great that he would only get burned himself.
He was later floating next to Nami and Tama when the victory of the
alliance
was announced.
Later, during the post-raid festival, Zeus was floating above Nami and Tama, hungrily staring at Nami's cotton candy.

Early Concepts
[
]
In one of his early design concepts, Zeus was known as the
North Wind
(
北風
,
Kitakaze
?
)
, rather than "Thundercloud".
This could mean that Zeus and Prometheus were at some point intended to reference one of Aesop's fables,
The North Wind and the Sun
.
