Maujii's color scheme in the manga.
Maujii, like all other dwarves, is quite short. He has a white beard and mustache and wears a helmet with a pompom that has goggles on it. He also wears an orange coat, purple gloves, blue pants, and purple boots.
Personality
[
]
Not much is known about his personality, but he seems to have great care and concern for Princess
Mansherry
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Maujii has yet to be seen fighting, but it is likely that he has the strength and speed similar to other dwarves. Sure enough, he ran with such speed that he failed to stop in time, resulting in him ramming open the storage door via sheer force despite his small stature.
History
[

Past
[
]
At some point, 500 dwarves, including Maujii and Princess Mansherry, were kidnapped by the
Donquixote Pirates
. The dwarves, except Mansherry, were forced to work in the
SMILE Factory
.
Dressrosa Saga

Dressrosa Arc

After the revolt of the dwarves began, Maujii raced to find Mansherry. He ran into a door, knocking it open because he could not stop. Though he did not find the princess, he managed to get a hold of a
Den Den Mushi
and contacted
Leo
, telling him that the princess was likely in the royal palace. He also relayed the information to
Viola
.
While
Franky
battled
Senor Pink
, the dwarves at the factory were contacted by Viola and they were worried when they heard that Mansherry was being forced to use her
healing powers
on the defeated Donquixote Pirates' officers. They were then overjoyed when Leo and
Kabu
successfully rescued Mansherry.
After Senor Pink's defeat, the dwarves proceeded with the destruction of the SMILE factory.
With the factory demolished, the dwarves carried an injured Franky back outside and started fleeing from the shrinking
Birdcage
. They later ran into
Roronoa Zoro
,
Kin'emon
, and
Kanjuro
. When Zoro informed them of his plan to hinder the Birdcage, the dwarves were awestruck.
Since the factory could not be cut by the Birdcage, the dwarves and Franky used it to push the Birdcage back.
When
Monkey D. Luffy
finally defeated
Donquixote Doflamingo
and brought the Birdcage down, the dwarves rejoiced with tears of joy as Luffy's victory was announced to Dressrosa.
Three days after Doflamingo's defeat, Maujii accompanied Mansherry while she was receiving donations from the
Marines
to heal the injured citizens.
Unbeknownst to the Marines, the donations they gave to Mansherry rendered them incapacitated when they were mobilized to pursue Luffy and his allies. Mansherry wondered if it was alright to leave them immobilized, but Maujii assured her that they received permission from
Kyros
.
