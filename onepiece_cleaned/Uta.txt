Personality
For the most part, Uta seems to be cheerful and optimistic where she possesses a strong ideal to build a new era of peace and happiness through her voice, even if it means people would be forced to live forever in the
Uta World
.
She is shown to be highly empathetic as she is seen feeling righteous anger for a fan that wrote her a letter after losing loved ones. She holds great value to the opinion of her fans, doubting her plans temporarily after some of her fans opposed her actions, although she evidently holds her own ideals above them as she turns her fans into objects to stop them from speaking their minds. She also hates pirates due to how much they destroy the lives of her fans and due to her father
Shanks
and
his crew
abandoning her.
However, she is also highly ignorant of pirates in general, as seen in Uta Diary #4 where she discovered posters of
Donquixote Doflamingo
and
Charlotte Linlin
and was completely unaware that they were a part of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
and the
Four Emperors
respectively, instead commenting on their fashion and the photo itself.
After her plans for New Genesis fail, she admits there are pirates who are worthy of respect as she regains her admiration for her father's crew and confides in
Monkey D. Luffy
's dream to usher a new world by becoming the Pirate King.
Due to her traumatic past, her isolation in Elegia and the continuous consumption of wake-shrooms, which causes the consumer to slowly lose control of their emotion, Uta became mentally unstable at times when her plans and ideals was met with resistance, causing her to have episodes where she would act erratic, ruthless, and borderline cruel to those around her, regardless whether they were her enemies or fans, as she was quick to abandon and try to kill Luffy when he refused to go along with her plans. This also made her incapable of reason or negotiation by anyone and she would ignore the pleas and warnings of others as she had planned to use
Tot Musica
as a last resort despite the warnings of destruction it would cause. Her reunion with Shanks would cause her to descend to complete madness to the point she would perform the
ritual
.
As a child, Uta acted like a stereotypical diva, being infatuated with jewelry and glamour and not liking to get dirty. She could be overbearing and mean, particularly to other children like Luffy, and though she liked to throw out insults she would cry if her victim insulted her back. She looked down on some of the wilder, more boorish behaviors of her father and his crew, but was still proud of being a member of the Red Hair Pirates.
Relationships
Shanks
Shanks
is Uta's adoptive father who does not address him as "father" or any of its synonyms, only referring to him as Shanks; she did this even when she was with him as a member of his crew due to the respect she had for him as a great pirate.
They once had a very close relationship, though after the events on
Elegia
resulting in its destruction, he left her on a burning island with
Gordon
and her view of her father changed. Seeing the
Red Hair Pirates
leave the burning island with all of its treasures with the false knowledge that the pirates were responsible, she grew a hatred for her father and his crew, which persisted even after she found out they were innocent concerning Elegia's destruction. After Shanks and
Monkey D. Luffy
together destroyed the
Tot Musica
with the help of their allies, Shanks and Uta rekindled their relationship where Shanks once again declares her his daughter and part of his family, causing her to tear up.
Monkey D. Luffy
Uta and
Luffy
were childhood friends and rivals, constantly entering competition only for Uta to win by distracting Luffy.
She takes joy in the fact that Luffy always claims to be winner, even though he always loses. When Luffy and the
Straw Hat Pirates
come to her concert, she is delighted to see him again and reminisces their joyful past together. However, after Luffy declares he wants to become Pirate King, Uta shows her disdain for pirates and attempts to convince Luffy to quit being a
pirate
and join her in the
New Genesis
.
However, after seeing his determination in saving her fans and herself from
Tot Musica
, she regains respect for her friend and tells him that she believes in his dream to become the Pirate King.
Red Hair Pirates
Uta held a large amount of mutual admiration for the
crew
of her father as a child, seeing them part of her family. After she was abandoned on
Elegia
with
Gordon
, her view of them changed, and she grew to despise them and all pirates, even despite eventually finding out they were innocent. However, seeing the crew protect the fans she ordered to attack them and even shield them from Marine bullets with their own bodies, she regained her respect for them. After this, she sees the crew as part of her family again.
Gordon
Gordon
raised Uta after the destruction of
Elegia
. While he acted as her foster parent, he was also her singing teacher, teaching her how to develop her singing abilities further. Although a mutual respect is implied to have existed, it disappeared after she told him about her plan due to his vehement opposal. When Gordon attempts to protect
Monkey D. Luffy
from Uta's attacks and gets injured, Uta is shocked, implying she still cares about him.
Abilities and Powers
Uta's singing voice has been appraised as "otherwordly"
(
別次元
,
betsu jigen
?
)
, enough to grant her the title of the
world
's greatest
diva
.
Aside from her singing talents, Uta is also great at music theory, showing amazing skill as a lyricist and composer by having written her most famous songs herself.
In terms of physical prowess, Uta has not displayed any superior abilities outside of being a talented and dexterous dancer, fully relying on her Devil Fruit ability to compensate. In fact, when
Monkey D. Luffy
fought her, he never actually directly attacked her body, knowing that he could potentially kill her if he did. She also does not have a lot of stamina since she usually would fall asleep after only a few songs. In the
One Piece Film: Red
movie, she counteracted this weakness by continuously consuming
Wake-shrooms
in order to last for hours.
Devil Fruit
Further information:
Uta Uta no Mi
Uta ate the Uta Uta no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to transport people's consciousnesses to a virtual space called "
Uta World
" by singing. Within Uta World, she is essentially all-powerful and able to do whatever she wants until she runs out of energy.
Tot Musica
Further information:
Tot Musica
Tot Musica is a Demon Lord sealed under
Elegia
by a previous user of the
Uta Uta no Mi
. Uta can use her Devil Fruit ability to unseal it and have it fight for her.
Charisma
Arguably, Uta's greatest weapon is her overwhelming charisma, which gained her worldwide popularity via her livestream performances.
Nico Robin
had stated that she was the world's most beloved person with
Brook
, a highly popular rockstar, claiming inferiority compared to Uta. Indeed, when she enacted her plan to pull people into
Uta World
, she managed to ensnare approximately 70% of the entire world's population. Also, while in Uta World, she commanded her entire audience in a pirate hunt, with the majority going along with her.
Weapons
Uta is seen wielding a
spear
and a shield and also used a jetpack that enables her to fly, although this was all in the
Uta World
. In the real world, she had a knife, although she never had the opportunity to use it.
History
Canon
19 years ago, Uta's hometown was attacked by
pirates
, resulting in her parents' deaths. The pirate crew kidnapped Uta, but as they set out to sail, they ran into the
Red Hair Pirates
; the two crews fought with the Red Hair Pirates emerging victorious. After claiming the pirates'
treasure
,
Shanks
discovered 2-year-old Uta in one of the treasure chests. With no way of finding her real family and recalling how he himself was found as a baby by the
Roger Pirates
in a similar manner, Shanks saw this encounter as fate and decided to raise her as his own daughter.
As an infant, Uta regularly cried, which kept the whole crew awake throughout the night. While trying to figure out a solution, he noticed a mother singing a lullaby to her own child. As such, whenever Uta was upset, the crew banded together to sing for her, which made the infant very happy.
Uta did visit
Foosha Village
with the Red Hair Pirates at some point.
However, she was then left on
Elegia
by the crew and separated from her father Shanks. Uta grew up to become a famous singer and songwriter and gained many fans, who told her of the suffering they were going through.
During the
Wano Country Arc
,
Shanks
thought of Uta as he asked
Admiral
Ryokugyu
whether the admiral was underestimating the new age of pirates.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Non-Canon
Past
Raised by Pirates
Uta as an infant discovered by the Red Hair Pirates.
An infant Uta was found in a treasure chest by the
Red Hair Pirates
, and
Shanks
decided to raise her as his daughter.
Growing up, Uta found her own passion for singing and became the crew's official
musician
. At some point before turning 9, Uta ate the
Uta Uta no Mi
, giving her the ability to transfer people's souls into her "
Uta World
" with her singing.
When Uta was 9, the Red Hair Pirates set up a base at
Foosha Village
in the
East Blue
. Very soon after landing, Uta met a 7-year-old boy named
Monkey D. Luffy
, whom she did not think much of. Uta demonstrated her singing talents at the Party's Bar, to great acclaim. Afterwards, Shanks had Luffy show Uta around the village and surrounding island. Uta and Luffy's clashing personalities caused them to get into many competitions, but a friendship started developing between them as Uta told Luffy about the Red Hair Pirates, which the boy was interested in joining. Luffy took Uta to the top of a windmill to see the sun set over the coast and it was there when Uta began dreaming of performing a concert for the entire world.
Some days later, after the duo raced on boats and encountered the
Lord of the Coast
, Uta and Luffy were on a coastal cliff. There, Uta told Luffy her dream of using her music to create a "new genesis" in the world.
Later, the Red Hair Pirates prepared to make a temporary voyage out to sea. Luffy attempted to stow away with them, but Uta caught him resulting in his removal. Uta told Luffy to get stronger while she was away and that she would test him upon her return.
Tragedy on Elegia
Uta then traveled with the
Red Hair Pirates
crew to
Elegia
, which was known for its talented musicians.
Shanks
allowed Uta to train herself in the art of singing under the apprenticeship of Elegia's
king
,
Gordon
. The people of Elegia immediately recognized her as a prodigy, resulting in her increased popularity. However, the tombs inside the island containing the demon
Tot Musica
also recognized her talents, causing the note sheets containing the key to releasing the demon to end up in Uta's hands. Unbeknownst to what the note sheets contained, Uta sang the song described on it and released the demon. Despite the efforts of Shanks and his crew to stop it, the demon destroyed the island and massacred the population before it was only stopped when Uta exhausted herself.
Afterwards, to save Uta from the guilt of destroying the island, Shanks made the decision to publicly take the blame for what happened. In order to let her develop into a proper singer, he left Uta with the only other survivor, Gordon, and took off with the island's treasures. Uta regained consciousness just in time to see them depart and was distraught with their betrayal and her own abandonment.
Rise to Stardom
Uta would find out 11 years later that the Red Hair Pirates were innocent and that she was responsible for the island's destruction, but her grudge against her father, his crew, and pirates in general persisted.
10 years later, she became popular as a diva after her breakout hit, "
New Genesis
", became popular. Since then, she had increased her fame by "streaming" her songs and dances worldwide via
Den Den Mushi
.
Using these, she communicated with her fans, who informed her of their miserable circumstances and their wish to listen to her music forever. Taking these wishes literally, she thought up a plan called New Genesis to end pain and misery in the world and replace them with peace and happiness by capturing as many people as possible into the
Uta World
created by her Devil Fruit powers.
Wano Country Saga
Uta's Past Arc
Uta stood alone on the coast of
Elegia
and proclaimed that she was about to make her dream of performing a concert for the whole world come true. She reminisced on her childhood with
Monkey D. Luffy
and her departure from
Shanks
before going to prepare for the concert.
One Piece Film: Red
Uta makes her debut appearance on her first live concert.
Once she was ready to act out her plan, Uta launched her first live concert, attracting people from across the world. By streaming her concert, she ensured the containment of people unable to visit her concert physically. As soon as she started singing, she encompassed every listener into her
Uta World
, but not before eating a
Wake-shroom
, a poisonous mushroom that allowed her to remain awake with the aim of eventually dying and live in her Uta World forever with her fans.
Uta reunited with Luffy.
After performing her first song "
New Genesis
", Luffy came onstage to reunite with Uta for the first time in 12 years. Uta was happy to see Luffy and embraced him. However, the
Big Mom Pirates
and
Jellyfish Pirates
then came onstage as well to try and capture Uta. Luffy and his crew, the
Straw Hat Pirates
, moved to defend Uta, but she said there was no need as she performed "
I'm Invincible
". During the course of this song, she summoned many soldiers and other tools to overwhelm the attacking pirates, eventually culminating in trapping them on a giant music staff.
Uta then conjured food, toys, and other pleasures for the concertgoers to enjoy as she took a break in the concert. She approached Luffy and the Straw Hats and challenged Luffy to an eating competition like the ones they used to have as children, conjuring meat and a bull to charge at them. As they competed, Uta conjured some juice to distract Luffy with, allowing her to win while Luffy was hit by the bull. Afterwards, Luffy revealed to Uta that he was a pirate now and intended to become the Pirate King, but she told him he should quit being a pirate and instead live on Elegia with her forever. Luffy refused, though, and Uta quickly grew hostile at this. Singing "
Backlight
", she went on the offensive against the Straw Hats, overwhelming them with her conjures and trapping all of them except for Luffy, whom
Trafalgar Law
managed to teleport away using
Shambles
.
Uta enlisted the aid of the devoted concertgoers to assist her in finding the escaped pirates, and created a large contraption out of instruments and musical notes to aid in the pursuit. She and the mob pursued Luffy's group to a cathedral where
Gordon
had housed them, and Luffy asked Uta why she had left the Red Hair Pirates. Uta angrily declared that she did not wish to talk about Shanks as she trapped Luffy and seized the
straw hat
that Shanks had given him, but Law was able to teleport the group away once again. As her mob went looking for them, Uta stayed behind to confront Gordon. Gordon pleaded with her not to go forward with her plan out of fear for her safety, but Uta revealed she possessed the song "
Tot Musica
" and intended to use it if necessary. Gordon cautioned her against doing this, but Uta did not listen as she trapped her other father on a staff.
In the real world, Uta was sitting surrounded by the sleeping bodies of the concertgoers when a
Marines
fleet led by
Admirals
Kizaru
and
Fujitora
arrived to confront her. The Marine soldiers donned ear protection to prevent Uta from taking them to Uta World, but Uta responded by taking control of the concertgoers. With the Marines unwilling to use force against them, she used the concertgoers to overwhelm their forces and remove their protection as she sang "
Fleeting Lullaby
".
Back in Uta World, Uta resumed her concert but was soon confronted by the
World Noble
Saint
Charlos
, who wanted to take her as a
slave
. However, since she controlled everything Uta was unafraid of his status and trapped the Marines sent to do his bidding before assaulting Charlos with music notes and trapping him on a staff as well. Uta proclaimed to the crowd that they no longer needed to fear the Celestial Dragons and that everyone would be equal in this world. However,
Koby
and
Blueno
then arrived onstage, and Koby revealed to the concertgoers that Uta had taken them out of reality. Uta tried to assure her fans that they were better off like this, but after some deliberation the majority of the crowd wished to go back to the real world. Stunned at her fans' resistance and growing more mentally unstable from the wake-shrooms, Uta submerged the concert arena with a liquid that transformed everyone into toys and food, though Koby and Blueno barely managed to escape.
Some time later, Luffy arrived to confront Uta. He could not bring himself to attack her and so tried convincing her to free everyone, but Uta remained steadfast in her goal. Luffy asked why she hated pirates now, and Uta told him the erroneous account of how Shanks and his crew abandoned her on Elegia after supposedly destroying and plundering it. Intending to kill Luffy to mark the end of the Pirate Era, Uta moved to put a knife through his heart in the real world, but was stopped by the arrival of Shanks and the Red Hair Pirates. Uta simply laughed at her father's arrival and sent the concertgoers to attack her former crewmates, while in the Uta World several of Luffy's crewmates and allies arrived to assist him against Uta.
Despite Uta's initial confidence, the Marines received orders to fire on the concertgoers in order to seize her, while
Bartolomeo
managed to nullify her powers in the Uta World by encasing her in a soundproof
barrier
. Growing more distressed and unstable, Uta unveiled her trump card and sang "Tot Musica" to summon the
titular being
. The song allowed her to shatter Bartolomeo's barrier, and Tot Musica quickly manifested itself. As Luffy raced to stop Uta, she conjured a spear to kill him, but the spear was intercepted by Gordon. Gordon revealed to Uta what really happened on the night Elegia was destroyed, but due to already knowing and being set on her goal regardless, Uta remained hostile toward Luffy before being consumed by Tot Musica as it reached a new form.
The pirates in the real world and Uta World eventually managed to defeat Tot Musica with simultaneous attacks, but since it had already consumed Elegia in Uta World those inside it were not sent back. Shanks went to Uta and told her to take a medicine that would put her to sleep immediately and save her from the wake-shrooms, but Uta rejected it in order to bring back everyone. She did so by singing "
The World's Continuation
", and before Luffy departed Uta World, she spoke to him and gave him his straw hat back, telling him to become a man even more worthy of it one day. Afterwards, Uta apologized to Shanks for not believing he would return and thanked him. The Marines moved to seize her, but Shanks declared that she was his daughter and forced them to stand down with his
Supreme King Haki
. Uta then departed the island together with her father and his crew on the
Red Force
; later, the crew was shown standing over what appeared to be a coffin with Uta not standing with them,
though her ultimate fate remains unknown.
