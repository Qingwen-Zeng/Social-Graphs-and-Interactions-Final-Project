Vice Admiral Dalmatian
is one of the many
Marine
vice admirals
to have participated in the
Summit War of Marineford
.
Appearance
[
]
With his Devil Fruit powers active, Dalmatian takes the form of a muscular, bipedal dalmatian-human hybrid. The top part of his head from his nose up and his arms and legs are that of a dalmatian: a white dog with black spots all over the body. He also has a long tail. However, the bottom half of his face is human just like most of Zoan users, and he has a blonde-white beard on a wide chin. His torso and neck also seem to remain human. He has yet to be seen in his default human or full dalmatian forms.
As a marine recruit, he had a standard marine cap and his face only had stubble on his chin with his Devil Fruit powers active.
Like all other vice admirals and other high ranking officers, he wears a double breasted suit, dress shirt, and a tie, with a Marine jacket draped loosely over his shoulders like a cape. His suit, in particular, is dark green in color. He wears a light red shirt underneath, with a darker red tie.

Devil Fruit
[
]
Dalmatian has eaten an unnamed
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a
dalmatian
. Using this, he can increase his fighting abilities and physical strength greatly, and can combine it with his Rokushiki style.
Being a carnivorous canine makes him better suited to combat than standard Zoans.
