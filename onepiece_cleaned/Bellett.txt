Bellett barging in on Ivankov.
Bellett had somehow found his way into Newkama Land with a bazooka. Upon which, he explained to Ivankov who he was and how he planned to kill Ivankov for ruining his life. When Iva pretended being scared, Bellett became irritated and shot a cannonball, only to have it reflected back at him when the okama queen winked at it.
As Bellett struggled to get back on his feet, Ivankov jumped and landed right in front of him, shocking Bellett. He then used his
Emporio Onna Hormone
on the former prince, turning him into a beautiful woman. Iva then offered
her
the chance to join him and his followers in Newkama Land, but she ran off in embarrassment instead.
