Lao G
is an
officer
of the
Donquixote Pirates
'
Diamante
Army.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist during the
Dressrosa Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Lao G is old and rather short. He is bald with veins protruding from his head. He has a beard and wrinkled skin. In his appearances, his eyes have been shadowed out, as they are extremely squinted. His mouth is also shadowed, suggesting that he doesn't have any teeth despite being able to speak and eat.
He wears a blue jumpsuit with a white arrow pointing upwards with two blue lightning bolt-like shapes pointing towards his shoulders. The jumpsuit has a belt with the letter "G" on the buckle. He also wears white gloves and boots.
He wears red tights under his jumpsuit, with blue arrows pointing downward on his legs.
As a child, Lao G had a curly patch of hair on his forehead with the front curl resembling a G. He wore a shirt with an arrow pointing upwards that had a "G" on it, a sash around his waist, white gloves, and black pants. His eyes were also wide and visible, yet to turn squinted.
At age 54, he wore a dark blue bunny-eared hat and had a more muscular body, as well as a black beard trimmed to form a G, and was shown to still have teeth.
At age 60, his hair had started to gray and he was becoming pot-bellied. He wore a cap with devilish horns and eyes, gloves, a blue bodysuit with a yellow gold matrix-pattern, what seems to be briefs over it and a belt with the green letter "G" as the gold yellow buckle.
Personality
[
]
He is a stern and loyal man, as is seen by his following Doflamingo's orders to the letter and regarding his captain's orders as absolute
. He is very calm and analytical, as he was able to deduce that Doflamingo had an ulterior motive for his supposed abdication.
However, despite his calm demeanor, Lao G has a bombastic and brutal side, joyfully showing his techniques against enemies to prove himself as a superior fighter and viciously pummeling his foes with brutal efficiency. In the anime, Lao G takes great pride in his skill, boasting to Sai, a formidable fighter in his own right, that he would need a century's worth of training to defeat him.
He also has an odd quirk that makes him emphasize the letter "
G
" in his words and even goes so far as to mimic it with his hands in various ways.
Lao G can also be exceptionally cruel as he gleefully mocked Baby 5 for being convenient for the Donquixote Family's purposes due to her desperation to be needed and viciously disposed of Don Chinjao when he was distracted.
He seems to be rather senile in his old age, such as when he went back into the elevator that he had just left instead of going to the Toy House. He appears to be far-sighted, as he needed glasses in order to spot
Kabu
up close. This does not seem to affect his fighting capabilities, however, as he was able to swat Kabu away quickly with minimal effort.
He is also hard of hearing.
He has his own
Laughter Style
: "Fafafafafafa".
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
Like other members of the Donquixote Pirates, he has respect and loyalty to Doflamingo and calls him "Young Master";
he considers Doflamingo's orders to be absolute and final.
However, he was somewhat irritated by his decision to go to Punk Hazard alone.
Trebol
[
]
Despite being an elite officer, Lao G berated
Trebol
for failing to protect a girl like Sugar, to which Trebol retorted in an angry manner of calling Lao G as a "geezer".
Baby 5
[
]
Lao G is shown to have very little respect for
Baby 5
for his naivety. As he played, he got angry when she tried to accept a prank proposal from Trebol,
During his battle with Sai, he said that he only considered her someone "convenient" for the Donquixote Family. Though he still said he was going to "save" her from Sai.
Enemies
[
]
Sai
[
]
Because he had defeated his grandfather, Lao G became an enemy of
Sai
. During their confrontation, Lao G called Sai a "monkey from the Country of
Kano
", further believing that he could quickly kill him; only for Sai to defeat him, still calling him "monkey".
Chinjao
[
]
One of his matches was against Chinjao. At the end of their fight, Chinjao finally focused on his grandson and ignored Lao G; but in the end he couldn't hear him. Lao G ultimately decided to finally defeat Chinjao while he was injured and bewildered.
Trafalgar Law
[
]
In the time when
Law
was in the crew, Lao G was not concerned that the boy was hurt by
Rosinante
, reminding him that he should always obey his superiors no matter what.
Even so, he was one of those who took care of training him. But once Law quit, Lao G considered him a traitor.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As an officer of the
Donquixote Pirates
, Lao G held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members and addition to having command of 2000 soldiers.
He is powerful enough to frequently participate in the
Corrida Colosseum
's tournaments, where the caliber of the fighters is very high, despite his age.
It is said that when Lao G and the other three officers of the Diamante Army enter the tournament, they have a 100% chance of victory.
This is especially notable, as Lao G is the only one of the officers to lack
Devil Fruit
powers or
fish-man
heritage, while boasting the same achievement based on physical skill alone.
Doflamingo also trusted him enough to guard the entrance to his factory from the Straw Hats' actions.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Lao G demonstrates his high speed and reflexes.
Despite his elderly age, Lao G has proven himself to be an extremely powerful and skilled martial artist, being able to knock down
Thunder Soldier
, a toy known for his speed and dexterity, with ease and pummel larger opponents with little effort. His incredible speed and reflexes are seen further when he managed to put his glasses on and then swat
Kabu
away in a fraction of a second, despite the fact that the dwarf, a member of a species that can move faster than the untrained eye can see, was mere inches away from his face.
Despite his frail appearance and behaviors, Lao G has a massive level of durability and endurance, able to survive with no notable injuries and stay conscious after Sai directly kicked his head with a
Armament Haki-imbued
Kiryu Kirikugi
, which split the entire ground they were standing on.
Lao G kicks Don Chinjao.
Even the likes of
Chinjao
, a pirate of legendary strength, is shown to be no match for him (although at the time the latter was still weakened by his fight against Luffy).
He was the one who taught
Law
hand-to-hand combat, along with a diagram of pressure points, showing his skills as a teacher.
However, his legs seem to be frail from old age, as they were shivering while standing, and his eyesight requires spectacles to see more clearly. Lao G also has shown that his hearing is not very good, as could not hear people that were right in front of him. His body can even become so weak that his spirit may leave it and be ready to pass on. However, he can just as quickly recover from near-death if he feels he has been called back, showing that he still has a very strong life force.
Jio-Ken
[
]
Further information:
Jio-Ken
Jio-Ken.
Lao G is a master of a martial arts style known as the Jio-Ken.
The techniques utilized all revolve a theme around his advanced age, taking advantage of any debilitating symptoms of an elderly as his fighting stance. With his mastery of Jio-Ken, he could fight and overwhelm Chinjao, who is an extremely powerful master of
Hasshoken
.
Lao G can use the ultimate technique of this style, which is to use
qigong
, the principle of cultivating and balancing one's own spiritual energy, to conserve his physical vitality from back during his youth, which he can store up until he needs it, granting him access to the immense strength of his prime once unleashed, thus negating his weaknesses of senescence.
In fact, it would seem that the practitioner's fighting prowess even increases as they age.
Weapons
[
]
In the past, Lao G used a bazooka to attack a Marines ship.
History
[

Past
[
]
Lao G eating dinner with the Family.
Lao G was already a member of the
Donquixote Pirates
, at age 54, when a 10-year-old
Trafalgar Law
joined. After Law had been with the crew for about a week, Lao G was having a meal with the other members of
Doflamingo
's "family". The crew then learned that Law was sick with the
Amber Lead Syndrome
and heard how Law escaped the extermination of
Flevance
. While out on a raid, Lao G and
Gladius
explained to
Baby 5
about the country of Flevance and how its people were inflicted with the Amber Lead Syndrome.
Lao G trains Law in martial arts.
After Law was made an official member of the crew, the Donquixote Pirates spread their influence as they traveled to the
Grand Line
. They participated in various activities such as looting, making business deals, and collecting
bounties
. Lao G was also instructed by Doflamingo to teach Law hand-to-hand combat skills.
Six months after
Corazon
and Law left the crew, the Donquixote Pirates plotted to steal the
Ope Ope no Mi
from pirates who were going to sell it to the
Marines
.
They later arrived at
Minion Island
and were informed by
Vergo
of Rosinante's treachery.
While Doflamingo covered part of the island in his
Birdcage
, the Donquixote Pirates raided and looted the
Barrels Pirates
' hideout. When they found Rosinante, they viciously attacked him until Doflamingo arrived.
Buffalo
and Baby 5 later informed Doflamingo that the Marines stationed at the island took custody of
a boy
. Thinking that the boy might be Law, the Donquixote Pirates left Rosinante for dead and prepared for departure. Before they left the island, they found themselves under fire by
Tsuru
's squadron.
He participated in Doflamingo's takeover of
Dressrosa
. After
Monet
opened the gates to the royal palace, the Donquixote Pirates stormed the palace.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Punk Hazard Arc
[
]
Lao G played cards with
Giolla
and asked Doflamingo what he would do to Trafalgar Law.
Later, when
Sugar
asked where Doflamingo was, Lao G suggested that he was in his room on the fourth floor, only to be told that she already looked there. They then figured that Doflamingo went to
Punk Hazard
alone. Lao G stated that it is just like Doflamingo to go off on his own while leaving behind his crew.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
While playing cards again, Lao G declared that Doflamingo's supposed decision to abdicate his throne was absolute when Baby 5 asked them if they saw
Trebol
. When Trebol, who jokingly asked Baby 5 to marry him, and she started to think he needed her, Lao G and Giolla yelled at her not to go there.
He later appeared at the
Corrida Colosseum
as one of the Donquixote Pirates' representatives in the tournament for the
Mera Mera no Mi
.
However, before the first round ended, Lao G was ordered to guard the
SMILE Factory
.
Lao G stops the Thunder Soldier.
After waiting at the entrance of the factory, he reentered the lift. When the lift reached mid-way to the palace, he defeated
Thunder Soldier
and his group of
dwarves
without considerable effort.
The lift later reached the palace and Lao G continued to have the upper hand. When the palace shook due to
Pica
's confrontation with Luffy's group,
Baxcon
,
Nubon
, and
Daikon
took the opportunity to pin Lao G down so that Thunder Soldier,
Kabu
, and
Rampo
could continue going after Doflamingo.
After the toys returned to their original forms, Doflamingo was exposed as a villain and proceeded to implement his "Birdcage" plan. Sometime after Pica relocated the royal palace to the top of
Flower Hill
, Lao G and some other officers gathered there to discuss with Doflamingo about plans concerning the
Straw Hat Pirates
and the Marines. Lao G reprimanded Trebol for failing to protect Sugar and
Diamante
for losing the Mera Mera no Mi.
Lao G attacks Orlumbus.
He was later seen on the second level of the new King's Plateau guarding the palace alongside
Machvise
, Baby 5, Gladius, and
Dellinger
.
As Luffy's allies reached the second level, Lao G declared that they will defeat them one by one.
Lao G and his four fellow officers later joined the fray. During the skirmish, Lao G punched
Orlumbus
in the face.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Lao G engages in a brief battle against
Elizabello II
, where the king fails to hit him as he is very agile. He then hits Ideo, who was going to attack Gladius in surprise as he was fighting with Sai. After a brief exchange of blows between all of them, Gladius exploits mines in the ground that repel Sai and Ideo.
He is seen having an argument with Chinjao, which ends with both hitting each other with their fists, causing several Donquixote Family subordinates to fly off due to the force of the impact.
Concludes non-canon section.
Continuing the battle, Lao G assumes the
Yotsu no Kamae
stance, after which he attacks
Chinjao
with a series of attacks from
Me no Tsukare
,
Kata Kori
and ends with
Fushi Bushi no Itami
, inflicting severe pain on Chinjao. He says that the more experience and pain his body knows, the stronger he becomes, since this is the power of his Jio-Ken fighting technique. However, Chinjao ignored his words and began a verbal skirmish with his grandson, which seemed to anger Lao G. At this moment, Lao G dies, and his soul prepares to pass into another world, though Baby 5 calls out to him, causing him to return. Lao G again tried to turn to Chinjao, but was ignored again as the latter was arguing with Sai.
Lao G defeats Chinjao.
After Chinjao granted Sai the title of Don, Lao G performed Jio-Ken Kyukyouku no Higi: Sento Ho Ken and easily defeated Chinjao. He then proceeded to fight Sai, proclaiming that as long as he lived, both Dressrosa and Baby 5 belonged to his master. However, Sai retaliated by kicking his head with a
Haki-imbued
Kiryu Kirikugi
, which split the entire ground they were standing on. Lao G apologized to the young master for his defeat and cursed Sai while falling into the split cracks.
Sai defeats Lao G.
His unconscious body was later brought to the palace alongside the fallen Machvise, Dellinger, and Sugar. Giolla intended to use
Mansherry
and
her healing powers
to revive him and the others. However, Giolla's plan was thwarted thanks to
Leo
and Kabu arriving and defeating Giolla and saving Mansherry.
After Doflamingo's defeat, Lao G and his fellow officers were arrested by the Marines.
