Rika
is a young girl from
Shells Town
, and the daughter of
Ririka
.
She currently serves as a waitress at the
153rd Marine Branch
.
Appearance
[
]
Rika is a young girl with black eyes, and dark hair done in pigtails. When she first met the
Straw Hat Pirates
, she wore a striped one-piece dress with what appeared to be a drawstring hood.
After two years, she has become taller and grown her hair out (though she continues to wear pigtails). Her
Marine waitress
uniform consists of an apron embroidered with a Marine emblem, a cook's bandana, and simple black shoes.
Personality
[
]
Rika is remarkably compassionate and brave for her age, enough to risk her life for people who have helped her (
e.g.
Zoro
), and even extend friendship to former enemies (
e.g.
Helmeppo
). At the same time, she can easily fall into tears or tantrums when frustrated.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
A budding
cook
, Rika can currently make a "sweet and mild curry" that is extremely popular among the
Marines
of the 153rd.
History
[

Past
[
]
Rika and
her mother
lived in
Shells Town
under
Captain
Morgan
's reign, constantly at the mercy of him and his son
Helmeppo
. One day, Helmeppo let
his pet wolf
roam the town and attack Rika, only for the traveling
bounty hunter
Roronoa Zoro
to cut the animal down. Though Rika's life was saved, Helmeppo retaliated by ordering Zoro arrested and incarcerated—without food—at the
153rd Branch
.

Romance Dawn Arc

Nine days into Zoro's incarceration, Rika tried to smuggle him homemade
onigiri
, despite Morgan's heavy penalties on anyone caught helping prisoners. To her dismay, he rebuffed her; shortly after, Helmeppo spotted her and took the onigiri for himself, only to find them ill-cooked (as the unpracticed Rika had made them with sugar instead of salt). In a rage, Helmeppo spat out and stomped on the onigiri, then ordered a subordinate
Marine
to physically throw Rika off the grounds.
Fortunately,
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Koby
witnessed these events, and caught Rika before she could be injured. The pair quickly befriended her—even feeding her half-ruined onigiri to Zoro—and from her learned of the Morgan family's tyranny. Subsequently, when Helmeppo began announcing Zoro's impending execution, Luffy punched him; though Rika cheered the young
pirate
on, she was soon found and hurried away by her horrified mother.
Later, Rika's trespass was reported to
Morgan
, who (to even Helmeppo's horror) ordered her execution. This, however, was prevented by the combined efforts of Luffy, Koby, and a just-freed Zoro, who defeated and overthrew the tyrannical captain. Afterward, Rika and her mother—and the rest of Shells Town—hailed the trio as heroes, and prepared a feast for them.
The newly-formed
Straw Hat Pirates
would soon leave Shells Town at the request of Morgan's more-reasonable
successor
; however, Koby stayed behind to pursue his dream of
Marinehood
, remaining close to Rika.
Diary of Koby-Meppo
[
]
Rika did not appear bothered when Helmeppo joined Koby in his cadet training at the 153rd, even making lunches for them both.
When the cadets became personal trainees to
Vice Admiral
Garp
and left for
Marineford
, she became severely upset, even (ineffectually) hitting the Marine who brought the news.

After the timeskip, she appeared to be more mature, and was training at the Marine base in Shells Town to become a waitress. She seemed to be much better at cooking, and was popular among the Marines. She also had a bounty poster of Monkey D. Luffy hanging on her workplace.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
While the manga gives Rika and her mother little elaboration, the anime establishes them as the keepers of a tavern. Relatedly, her first encounter with Zoro is expanded into a full flashback explaining that Helmeppo and his wolf were deliberately harassing the tavern's customers, and the wolf had attacked her for trying (ineffectually) to drive it out with a broom.
The anime also has Rika asking about the
Grand Line
, prompting
Koby
to explain the
world
's basic geography (information the manga originally relayed through
Nami
on the
Island of Rare Animals
).
