Appearance
[
]
Juki's concept art from the anime.
As an artificial recreation of an ancient giant, Juki is significantly larger than even normal giants. He has purple skin, appears to be hunchbacked, and possesses an elongated head resembling that of a dragon. His mouth is lined with large, sharp teeth, and his tongue often hangs out of the side. His eyelids are notably dark. He has a pair of dark horns that go up at first but then slope downward about a third of the way up. He has a wild mane of light hair that starts out narrow between his horns but shrouds his backside. Like many of his fellow Numbers, Juki's only article of clothing is a loincloth with tiger stripe-like patterns on it. On the left side of his abdomen is a tattoo of the
daiji
"æ‹¾", meaning ten.
In the anime, he has a purplish skin.
Personality
[
]
Like the other Numbers, Juki is frequently drunk and brutishly violent against the
Beasts Pirates
' enemies.
He appears to be quite careless, as he dropped a barrel of alcohol while drinking from it. Like the other Numbers, he has a
unique laugh
that plays off his name: "Jukikiki".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Thanks to his large size, Juki has a great amount of physical power that eclipses a typical person's. However,
X Drake
in his man-beast form managed to defeat him with a single combined strike of his sword and axe.

Past
[

Over 20 years ago, Juki was a subject in an experiment on
Punk Hazard
that attempted to
recreate
the
ancient giants
. The experiment was a failure, but Juki and his fellow test subjects were recruited by
Kaidou
. They began residing on
Onigashima
and joined Kaidou's crew, the
Beasts Pirates
, as a group called the
Numbers
.
Wano Country Saga

Wano Country Arc
[

Five days before the
Fire Festival
, the Numbers arrived in
Hakumai
via Mogura Port and headed toward Onigashima with
Scratchmen Apoo
.
On the day of the Fire Festival, Juki and the Numbers took part in the Beasts Pirates' Golden Kagura festivities. While drinking, Juki ended up dropping his alcohol barrel, annoying his crewmates nearby.
However, the party did not last long as the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
invaded Onigashima to take down Kaidou. Once the fighting broke out, Juki began rampaging in the
Skull Dome
with
Jaki
and
Goki
.
When Goki confronted
Monkey D. Luffy
, Juki went to assist him, but was then suddenly struck to the ground by
X Drake
's X Calibur attack.
