"Town-Collapser" Drophy
,
better known by her alias
Miss Merry Christmas
, is a former
officer agent
partnered with
Mr. 4
.
She was a major antagonist during the
Arabasta Arc
. After the downfall of Baroque Works, she works as a "princess" at the new
Spiders Cafe
alongside most of her former colleagues.
Appearance
[
]
Drophy is a stout, middle-aged woman with red hair. She wears a necktie that resembles a Christmas tree, which goes with her codename. Other notable attire include a large pair of purple-lensed sunglasses, a basket strapped to her back, and sandals.
Due to her
Devil Fruit
, she can also turn herself into a humanoid mole.
During
Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
, she wore a typical striped prisoner outfit and retained her glasses. After escaping from prison, she now wears a fancy
princess
outfit.
Personality
[
]
Unlike her partner, who is very slow, Drophy talks very quickly, often only pronouncing the first syllable of the word in a high-pitched, child-like voice. Due to her love of talking, she acts as the brains of the Mr. 4 pair. Much like
Crocodile
, she takes a cynical view towards those like Luffy who wish to become the Pirate King, and quite happily informs
Usopp
that
Luffy
is dead, and that the world will be better off without dreamers like him.
She also complains about her back frequently and will command Mr. 4 to massage it for her. She has a tendency to end sentences with a "Ba".
Relationships

Mr. 4
[
]
Drophy often fusses at Mr. 4 for being so slow and orders him around all the time; for example, she commands him to massage her back. However in spite of this, they show near perfect team-work in battle without falling out of sync. Miss Merry Christmas also cares for Mr. 4 as a person, as she was shocked when she thought Usopp killed him with his fake hammer and lamented his assumed death.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Beyond her Devil Fruit ability Drophy has not demonstrated much fighting ability. She, however, definitely seems to be considerably smarter and therefore in charge of her partner Mr. 4's actions, as he is too slow to do much of anything without guidance. She was also able to survive having her tunnel system blown up by Lassoo and remained almost completely uninjured.
Like her partner, Drophy has also been shown to be extremely stealthy, as she managed to bypass the Alubarna palace's tight security in order to abduct
King
Cobra
.

Further information:
Mogu Mogu no Mi
Drophy in her human-mole form.
Drophy ate the
Mogu Mogu no Mi
, a
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to transform into a mole or a mole-human hybrid.
She is able to dig through the ground at high speeds, allowing her to get the drop on her enemies and stay hidden so that her opponents cannot attack her. She can even dig through solid stone with no effort.
She also has long sharp claws that she can use to attack her opponents.
History
[

Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
Mr. 4 and his partner Miss Merry Christmas were summoned by
Crocodile
along with the other remaining
officer agents
to meet at the
Spiders Cafe
in order to get assignments for the upcoming battle. Mr. 4 did not do much during that time, aside from give Miss Merry Christmas a massage, and giggle when
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
started to dance. He later travels with the other officer agents to
Rainbase
, where they received their missions. For their job, Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas were assigned to kidnap
Nefertari Cobra
, which they were successful in completing. They later rejoined the other officer agents to stop
Nefertari Vivi
from reaching the rebels and they chased after
Sanji
, and
Tony Tony Chopper
. At first, Chopper had to fight the two alone as Sanji left to check on Vivi, but later
Usopp
arrived to assist Chopper in fighting the Mr. 4 team in Sanji's place.
Miss Merry Christmas is knocked out by Mr. 4.
After blinding Mr. 4 with his Kemuri Boshi (Smoke Star), Usopp was able to escape from Miss Merry Christmas and her partner's combined attack (Molehill Intersection Number 4), leaving Chopper (who was using Horn Point) to scoop her into his antlers. Falling for Usopp's impression of her, Mr. 4 immediately slugged her in the face with his bat and sent her flying into a stone arch.
Lassoo
then coughed up one last explosive baseball.
After Operation Utopia failed with
Luffy
beating Crocodile, Miss. Merry Christmas was found and arrested by the Marines headed by Tashigi.
She, along with the other arrested Baroque Works agents were then sent to prison.
