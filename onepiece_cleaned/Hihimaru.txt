Abilities and Powers
[
]
Hihimaru possesses a great amount of strength, and is well-known for it by the residents of
Kuri
, being called the "raging baboon of the mountain". It had developed a great reputation while serving the
Beasts Pirates
, and its keepers were concerned at it being tarnished when the komainu
Komachiyo
put up a fight against it.
Its loss was seen as significant by the Beasts Pirates, and caused them to take an interest in Tama and her
taming
powers.
Tama is confident enough that he can delay both Page One and Ulti at the same time for three minutes.
In the anime, Hihimaru was struck by Page One's ancient zoan form and continued to fight, implying great endurance.

Wano Country Arc
[

A group of
Beasts Pirates
and Hihimaru threatened a young girl named
Tama
when she ended up mentioning the
Kouzuki Family
, and the komainu
Komachiyo
attacked Hihimaru to protect her. The two fought viciously, and Hihimaru threw Komachiyo into the
Thousand Sunny
. The Beasts Pirates told Hihimaru to go after the nearby
Monkey D. Luffy
after Luffy attacked them, but Hihimaru quickly became subdued when facing Luffy. Tama then offered Hihimaru some
kibi-dango
, which tamed the baboon. Luffy and Tama then rode Hihimaru and Komachiyo to
Amigasa Village
, the home of Tama and
her master
.
When Tama became sick from drinking contaminated water, Hihimaru remained in the village, while Luffy and Komachiyo carried Tama to a nearby town.
Hihimaru remained in the village after Tama,
Kiku
,
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, and
Tony Tony Chopper
left the village to go for a walk to Kuri Beach. The baboon listened as Hitetsu spoke to them through a
Smart Tanishi
.

The next day, Hihimaru boarded an enemy ship with Tama and Komachiyo and headed to
Onigashima
. Hihimaru followed the other two into the Skull Dome, and on Tama's command, he attacked the Tobiroppo
Page One
and
Ulti
so that Tama and Komachiyo could flee with
Usopp
and
Nami
.
The baboon was later defeated by the two Tobiroppo.
