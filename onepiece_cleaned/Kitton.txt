Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, Kitton and his grandfather's roles are extended. They drag Franky to the hospital after he got frozen by the cold. After Franky recovered, he had a change in personality and behaved as a gentleman by using red tea as an alternative power source. This did not go well for Kitton as he thinks Franky's former personality is more fun. In an attempt to gain Franky's original personality back, he took Franky into a forest with vicious cyborg animals. Apparently, Franky managed to gain his former personality back and Kitton then takes Franky to Vegapunk's old lab to make more cola.
In the anime, he has a name and he is a little boy. However, in the manga, he was not given a name and he is a tall young man.
