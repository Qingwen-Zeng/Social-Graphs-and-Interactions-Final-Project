In the manga, Kato and his comrades were defeated by Nami using Zeus' thunderbolt during the chase in the Seducing Woods. In the anime, Pedro defeated him in battle instead.
During the Big Mom Pirates' assault on Wano Country, Kato is not seen in the manga accompanying his mother. He is only seen alongside his siblings in the anime.
