History
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Hyougoro defeats Alpacaman.
When news of
Eustass Kid
's escape from the Prisoner Mines was announced and the guards were demanding for those that knew of any information to come forward, Alpacaman remarked that Kid was stupid for escaping without freeing himself of his
Seastone
handcuffs. Alpacaman tormented
Monkey D. Luffy
by spitting on him and questioned if he had helped Kid escape.
After many fighters failed to kill Luffy and Hyougoro during the Sumo Inferno, Alpacaman and
Madilloman
entered the ring. Alpacaman tried to attack Hyougoro, but the latter managed to avoid his attacks thanks to Luffy using
Observation Haki
to guide him. Eventually, Hyougoro defeated Alpacaman using
Armament Haki
.
