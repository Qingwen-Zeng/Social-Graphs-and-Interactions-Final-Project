Biography
[
]
Ginny was born 51 years ago in the
Porco Kingdom
on the
Grand Line
.
At the age of four, Ginny was
enslaved
by the
World Nobles
.
Nine years after becoming a slave, she was forced to take part in the
Native Hunting Competition
on
God Valley
. Two weeks prior, she had wire-tapped the Celestial Dragons'
communication
and learned about the competition's prizes: the
Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu
and the
Nikyu Nikyu no Mi
. Realizing the potential to escape, she and
Ivankov
planned an escape from the competition by sending a signal outside the island about the competition and the prizes, prompting the later arrival of the
Rocks Pirates
,
Roger Pirates
, and
Marines
. Ivankov and her hoped the commotion between the
pirates
, the Marines and the
God's Knights
would give them the opening to steal the
Devil Fruits
for their own escape.
She and Ivankov came across the beaten-up
Bartholomew Kuma
who had attempted to escape.
When the competition started, she and Ivankov explained the situation to the other slaves and invited them to participate in the escape plan. Eventually, she, Kuma, Ivankov, and 500 slaves and natives successfully escaped the island thanked to Kuma's Nikyu Nikyu no Mi ability.

Afterwards, the three made it to the
Sorbet Kingdom
. At Kuma's family church, Ginny and Ivankov complemented Kuma's actions that led to the freedom of over 500 slaves. Ivankov then decided to set out to
sea
, while Ginny and Kuma decided to stay together. The two went on to live great lives in the kingdom.
Eight years later, Kuma became a pastor at his family's church who spent Sundays repelling people's pain to take onto himself. Ginny would get frustrated at them as they could not pay any money due to the kingdom's Heavenly Tribute. During this time, she took care of Kuma as he took in so much pain. Five years later, she wanted to marry Kuma, which he declined as he did not want his
Buccaneer
heritage to put her in danger, while they were also reading about the actions of the
Freedom Fighters
.
Ginny assists in founding the Revolutionary Army.
Three years later, Kuma protested against the Royal Army of Sorbet enslaving citizens who could not pay the Heavenly Tribute, which led to his imprisonment. Shortly after, Ginny and a few others were imprisoned as well after demanding that Kuma be released. Kuma felt stressed that the country was going in this direction, but Ginny assured him that if they wanted to oppose this, they would have to fight against the
World Government
itself. While they were in prison, the Freedom Fighters came to the island and liberated it. Ginny and Kuma were then released from prison by
Dragon
and Ivankov, and Kuma was invited to join the Freedom Fighters. Ginny and Kuma joined the organization together, and it later turned in to the
Revolutionary Army
. Eight years later, Ginny had become the commander of the East Army. In a certain country, she and the East Army had planned to meet up with Kuma's group the next day. However, she was later captured.
Ginny was eventually forced into marriage with an unnamed World Noble as the 8th wife. Two years into her stay on
Mary Geoise
,
Jaygarcia Saturn
performed an experiment on Ginny which resulted in a failure, with Ginny contracting the
Sapphire Scales
disease and were thrown out of
Mary Geoise
, and inadvertently setting her free.
At some point through this, Ginny gave birth to a baby daughter,
Jewelry Bonney
. While she and Bonney made their way back to Sorbet, Ginny called the Revolutionary Army headquarters and spoke to Kuma, Ivankov, and Dragon one last time. She explained that she had not much longer left to live due to her disease, and asked Dragon and Ivankov to take care of Kuma. She also attempted to tell Kuma that she loved him, but this message was never received, as Kuma had already left in a desperate attempt to get to her. Kuma was unable to arrive in time, and was informed by the grieving elderly that Ginny had passed away after being exposed to natural light, a symptom of her disease.
Legacy
[
]
Kuma mourns Ginny's death.
After her death, she was buried near the church where both she and Kuma lived together throughout their life, with Kuma swearing to protect and raise her daughter as his own.
Her position remained vacant for eight years until
Belo Betty
took over as the new East Blue Commander with Kumaâ€™s blessing.
Eventually, Bonney showcased symptoms of the same disease that claimed her mother's life, forcing her to stay indoors most of her childhood,
but with help from
Dr. Vegapunk
,
Bonney was cured of her disease.
However, because of
Jaygarcia Saturn
's interception, Kuma had to agree to become a member of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
and submit to
cyborg
modifications as part of the
Pacifista
project that would cause him to lose his personality and free will in order for Bonney to be treated.
Before the
Egghead Incident
, Bonney learned of her mother through
reading Kuma's memories
, becoming proud of the amazing woman she was.
