Summit War Saga
[

Marineford Arc
[
]
When
Portgas D. Ace
was to be executed at
Marineford
, Zodia and his crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
in order to save him from execution. While the
Marines
were bracing for the arrival of the pirates, Zodia and the allied fleet of the 43 subordinate captains caught them by surprise when the fleet suddenly appeared out of nowhere just off the shores of Marineford.
The pirates then began firing cannonballs at the Marines, however, the cannonfire was easily fended off by the
Vice Admirals
. In response to the scene in front of him, Zodia laughed at whether there had ever been so many Vice Admirals gathered in one place.
Right after
Sengoku
revealed that
Monkey D. Luffy
was actually the son of
Monkey D. Dragon
, Zodia watched in shock at the young pirate's ability to send one of the
Giant Squad
members flying backwards.
After Ace was freed, Zodia watched alongside
Epoida
as
Squard
and his crew burst into the plaza and exclaimed that they would sacrifice themselves so that the other pirates could leave.
Zodia breaks into tears.
Later, after the death of Ace,
Whitebeard
decided that he alone would remain at Marineford and so ordered his sons to escape as he split the plaza into two, with all his subordinates on the other side. Faced with the death of Ace and their separation from their boss, Zodia could not contain his tears and so fell to the ground crying. Seeing this,
Zucca
scolded Zodia and told him to cry while on the ship instead.
Afterwards, the
Red Hair Pirates
arrived and Sengoku ended the war, allowing the surviving pirates to leave.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga version of Whitebeard and Ace's funeral in
Chapter 590
, Zodia cannot be seen among those in attendance. However, the anime version of the exact same scene in
Episode 505
explicitly shows Zodia alongside the other attendees.
Although it can be assumed that Zodia was at the funeral, there is no visual evidence of his attendance in the manga to support this assumption and, as such, his attendance can only be considered non-canon. Furthermore, Zodia's color scheme in this anime scene is changed to him having dark brown hair and a blue shirt, as opposed to the color scheme in which he was originally seen with in the anime.
