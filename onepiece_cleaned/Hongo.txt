Hongo
is the one of the
Senior Officers
and the
doctor
of the
Red Hair Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Hongo is a lean man with dirty blonde hair, which is tied up into a small ponytail. He has a stitched scar on the left side of his forehead.
His outfit consists of an open coat showing his torso.
In his first appearance in Luffy's childhood, Hongo looked pretty similar to his current self, but seemingly lacked a few teeth despite having a full set of them in the present.
Personality
[
]
Like many of his fellow Red Hair crew members, Hongo enjoys partying, drinking, and the pirate life.
However, at the Summit War of Marineford, he looked considerably more serious.
Hongo is also not shy of deceivement, as he was testing
Bartolomeo
's faith to
Luffy
by trying to persuade him to deliver a supposed lethal poison to Luffy, even labelling it as extremely painful and agonizing to whoever drinks it.
He loves cleanliness.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Hongo is a Senior Officer of the Red Hair Pirates, giving him authority over lower-ranking members of the crew.
Hongo is a powerful individual himself, considering how Marine Commodore
Brannew
described the whole crew as having a high average of bounties.
As a doctor, Hongo has great knowledge of medical practices. He is also very familiar with weapons and can dismantle them near instantaneously.
His medical knowledge helps him defeat his enemies, as he could describe a harmless vial of an unknown substance into a supposedly deadly poison with various agonizing symptoms and the final result to Bartolomeo without raising suspicions.
Weapons

Sometime later, the Red Hair Pirates made their way to
one of their territories
, in order to punish Bartolomeo for burning their flag. Bartolomeo apologized profusely for his actions, while Hongo gave him a task: kill Luffy within a month using poison, and all would be forgiven. Hongo was shocked when Bartolomeo outright denied the request and drank the apparent poison on his own, proclaiming that his loyalty to Luffy was worth more than his own life. As the poison was fake, Bartolomeo was shocked to find himself still alive. As he had passed their test, the Red Hair Pirates allowed the
Barto Club
to leave, but not before teaching them a lesson by blowing their ship up.
