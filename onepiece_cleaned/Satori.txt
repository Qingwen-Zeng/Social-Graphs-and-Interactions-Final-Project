Satori of the Forest
punished criminals with the
Ordeal of Balls
during
Enel
's reign.
He was one of Enel's
top warriors
, the Skypiea Priests, until his defeat. He is also the oldest triplet brother of
Hotori and Kotori
. Due to this actions, he was a major antagonist of the
Skypiea Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Satori was a round-shaped man with fair skin and long, dark red hair. He is clad in a white, full-body jumpsuit, which has a vertical line of golden rings that run from front to back, an orange hat similar in style to a Capello Romano, orange gloves, shoes, and large, yellow sunglasses that completely obscure his eyes. In addition, he carries a large, striped cane, which he uses to control the Ball Dragon. Like other
Birkans
, he has small white wings on his back.
Eight years ago, he looked the same, except that the rings on his jumpsuit weren't connected to each other.
Personality
[
]
Satori was a playful and silly character, rarely seen without a smile on his face, who moves around largely by hopping and prancing. He notably exhibits this behavior while fighting
Luffy
,
Usopp
, and
Sanji
, pitting their lives against his deadly traps; whether this is out of childish oblivion or calculated sadism and cruelty is not known. His normal demeanor is known to dissolve into panicking when his plans go awry, as he became frantic once Luffy and Sanji bypassed his pitfalls and defeated him.
Like many One Piece characters, he has his own distinctive
Laughter Style
: "Ho, ho hoooo!"
Relationships
[
]
Satori was not good on good terms with his fellow priests
Shura
,
Ohm
and
Gedatsu
due to their competition over the execution of criminals, where the first to kill is seen as the strongest. His two triplet brothers,
Hotori and Kotori
, seem to have a good relationship with Satori as they wanted revenge for his defeat at the hands of the
Straw Hat Pirates

Ordeal of Balls
[
]
Further information:
Ordeal of Balls
Some "Surprise Balls" extruding spears (back) and a giant crab (front).
Satori was the priest in charge of testing intruders with the Ordeal of Balls, with a survival rate of 10%. As part of his
Ordeal of Balls
, Satori uses what he calls
Surprise Clouds
(
びっくり雲
,
Bikkurigumo
?
)
, large
ball clouds
that float around the area, as his main weapon.
These balls contain a wide variety of items, ranging from largely harmless (flowers, songbirds) to genuinely dangerous (
poisonous
snakes,
explosives
, bladed weapons). As the balls are outwardly identical, his opponents can never be sure of their contents, forcing them to constantly evade them.
Techniques
[
]
Bikkuri Tamatsuki
(
びっくり玉突き
,
Bikkuri Tamatsuki
?
, literally meaning "Surprise Billiards")
: Satori launches a surprise cloud into another surprise cloud, calculating their ricochet trajectories (a la
billiards
and other
cue sports
) so they will reach a faraway opponent. As Satori has advanced knowledge of all the clouds' positions, he can use this technique to feint an attack toward one opponent while actually aiming for another.
In the Funimation dub, it is known as
Surprise Cloud Billiards
.
Satori unleashes the Tama Dragon.
Bikkuri Tamakazura: Tama Dragon
(
びっくり玉鬘 玉ドラゴン
,
Bikkuri Tamakazura Tama Doragon
?
, literally meaning "Suprise Jeweled Chaplet: Ball Dragon")
: Satori's ultimate attack, connecting many surprise clouds filled with incendiaries, gunpowder, and many bladed weapons in a serpentine shape, with a dragon mask strapped atop the "head" cloud. The mask is connected to his cane with a long, flexible rope, allowing Satori to directly steer the dragon toward enemies; attacking it is extremely risky, as triggering an incendiary cloud will set off a massive chain
explosion
in all of the clouds (launching the blades as shrapnel).
Tamakazura
(
玉鬘
?
)
is also the name of a chapter and a character from the
The Tale of Genji
, a classic work of Japanese literature. In the Viz manga and Funimation subs, this is called
Surprise Ball Attack: Ball Dragon.
In this Funimation Dub, this is called
Sphere Dragon
Weapons
[
]
Satori has a pair of
Impact Dials
bound beneath his gloves; like all Impact Dials, these can absorb the force of an opponent's attacks and re-release it as a powerful shockwave.
(Curiously, he appears to use these against the Straw Hats multiple times
without
intercepting any attacks beforehand, suggesting he may be carrying several pre-charged Dials.)
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Satori can use
Observation Haki
, which is called "Mantra" in
Skypiea
, to predict what his opponent will do before they attack.
Like the other priests, he can sense the presence of people within a range that covers the entirety of
Upper Yard
.
However, Satori admits that he still requires more training, as his concentration can falter due to unexpected events, leaving him vulnerable. As with Observation Haki, his "Mantra" is useless if he is restrained, as he cannot dodge blows whether he predicts them or not.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Satori was born on the sky island of
Birka
along with his younger brothers,
Hotori and Kotori
. Eight years before the current storyline, Birka was destroyed by
Enel
and Satori travelled to Skypiea as one of Enel's warriors.
He took part in the invasion of
Upper Yard
, which resulted in the former God
Gan Fall
being usurped by Enel.
Under Enel's rule, Satori became one of the four priest of Skypiea and was tasked with administering punishment to criminals with the
Ordeal of Balls
.
Sky Island Saga
[
]
Skypiea Arc
[
]
The four priests Satori,
Shura
,
Ohm
and
Gedatsu
competed to eliminate a man called
Zabo
who had trespassed on Upper Yard, but their pursuit was interrupted near the coast when
Wyper
attacked them with his
Burn Bazooka
. After Zabo was killed by Enel's
lightning blast
, Gedatsu explained that another
group of illegal trespassers
had arrived in Skypiea.
Satori using an Impact Dial to assault Sanji.
When
Usopp
,
Luffy
and
Sanji
arrived at the Ordeal of Balls, Satori greeted the Straw Hats. Because of his carefree attitude and dancing, Luffy and Sanji underestimated his ability and attempted to attack him, only to have their attacks dodged by Satori's Mantra, and then each Straw Hat was blown off their craft and into the forest by Satori's Impact Dial. Satori then revealed his ordeal: the Straw Hats' boat would continue to traverse the Milky Road out of the forest unless they could board the boat and stop it. If they could not stop the boat then they would be forever lost.
Sanji defeats Satori with
Concassé
As Sanji and Usopp attempted to locate the boat, Luffy was easily defeated due to Satori's Mantra, and all three took multiple Impact Dial attacks.
Satori then revealed his ultimate attack, the Ball Dragon, and proceeded to chase Luffy around the forest with it. Once Luffy discovered the string that Satori used to control the chain, he was able to break his control and send the dragon flying back at him. Due to the explosion Satori temporarily lost control of his Mantra, and failed to see Luffy clinging to his back. Luffy tied up Satori with his stretched limbs holding him still and thus rendering his Mantra ability useless, as he could not dodge attacks even if he could sense them, allowing
Sanji
to defeat him with his Concasse.
With her Mantra,
Aisa
senses Satori's defeat and reports to
Wyper
, giving the Shandia warrior additional incentive to launch his assault on Upper Yard.
After Enel's defeat, the Shandia sentenced Satori and the other priests to
Cloud Drifting
.
