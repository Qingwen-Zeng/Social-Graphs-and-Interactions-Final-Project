Chapter 1041
.
Kouzuki Hiyori
is the daughter of the late
Kouzuki Oden
and
Kouzuki Toki
and the younger sister of
Kouzuki Momonosuke
.
To hide her identity, Hiyori became known as
Komurasaki
,
working as an oiran of the
tayu
(
太夫
,
tayū
?
)
rank, the highest of all.
However, after she angered
Kurozumi Orochi
,
Denjiro
(in his disguise as
Kyoshiro
) staged a killing of Komurasaki in order to keep Hiyori safe.
She is the one who gave her late father's
legendary sword
Enma
to
Roronoa Zoro
in exchange for
Shusui
.
After
Kaidou
was defeated in the
Raid on Onigashima
, she revealed to
Wano
that she was still alive as well as her true identity. Hiyori now lives in the
Flower Capital
with her brother after he became the new
Shogun
. She is also the caretaker of
Toko
.
Hiyori is a supporting ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Wano Country Saga
.
Appearance
Hiyori is a slim woman of average height who holds a strong resemblance to her
mother
with long turquoise hair that reaches her waist, blue eyes that are distinctively slanted at a downward angle and she wears fuchsia lipstick on her prominent lips.
She is considered the most beautiful woman in all of
Wano
where her beauty is so unfathomably great that people can barely look directly at her. Her looks alone are enough to make people faint, go blind and suffer severe blood loss via nose bleeds.
As
Komurasaki
, she wore geta to make her look very tall. Her hair was extremely adorned with multiple flowers and pins attached to it. She wore an extremely opulent red furisode kimono that sparkles in the sunlight with the sleeve adorned with a peacock and flowers on it. She also had red-painted fingernails.
She also wears a kitsune fox mask while playing the shamisen so people, and especially
Kurozumi Orochi
, cannot see her crying in grief and rage.
After leaving the
Flower Capital
, Hiyori left most of her hair down with her bangs covering her forehead while some of her hair is held up by pins in an elaborate bun behind her head. She took out most of its adornments except for one on each side of her head shaped like a pink rose with a gold dangler. She also stopped wearing her outer garment, wearing a pink furisode kimono with purple flower designs along the sleeves with light and the bottom. She also removed her red nail polish off her fingers.
She had a bob cut when she was six.

Personality
Hiyori refuses to cry for joy at the thought of reuniting with her brother.
Hiyori is a very proud woman who is unwilling to back down or show vulnerability in front of others. She claims that this is due to being a
daughter
of a
samurai
. This is true even in the face of authority, being unafraid of standing up to and even attacking the shogun
Kurozumi Orochi
despite the heavy consequences.
Because of her pride, she refuses to cry at the thought of reuniting with her
older brother
, stating that as the daughter of a samurai, she must not cry.
During her guise as
Komurasaki
, Hiyori appeared to be a greedy and materialistic woman, as well as a good manipulator. After successfully swindling her victims, she treated them very coldly without any compassion or remorse, saying that she despises the poor.
However, it was later revealed that the men she swindled were guilty of highly immoral acts and she passed all the money she swindled to
Denjiro
for him to distribute to the poor citizens of Wano rather than keeping it for herself.
Hiyori cries over Yasuie's death.
In reality, Hiyori is an extremely kind and compassionate woman who is kind to those she is close to, such as her kamuro
Toko
and she was appalled when
Kurozumi Orochi
attempted to attack her, given that she is a child.
She is deeply sympathetic towards the many citizens of
Wano
who had been cruelly oppressed by Orochi and
Kaidou
. She broke down crying uncontrollably after
Shimotsuki Yasuie
was executed.
Despite her kindness, Hiyori has the desire to kill Orochi as she is not afraid to get her hands dirty.
While being chased by
Kamazo
, Hiyori let go of her prideful attitude, pleading for
Roronoa Zoro
to help her and Toko.
She is very gracious as she was extremely grateful to Zoro for saving her and made good on her offer to feed him in return. She can be rather careless and timid.
She can be a tease, asking Zoro if he was happy to be sleeping with her.
Hiyori has a deep love for her country as she is willing to give up her father
Kouzuki Oden
's heirloom
Enma
to Zoro in exchange for Wano's national treasure
Shusui
in order to return it to the country. Before
Kawamatsu
and Zoro left to rejoin their comrades to overthrow Kaidou and Orochi, Hiyori sincerely bowed to the two, requesting them to do their best in saving Wano from their tyranny.
Hiyori loved music, having enjoyed playing the shamisen since childhood.
According to
Kin'emon
, she was a tomboy when she was a child and was quite insolent and brash, a trait she inherited from her father when he was young. Momonosuke stated that Hiyori liked to act tough, but she was quite a crybaby. Even as an adult, Hiyori retained some of her childish personality when she dropkicked her brother, Momonosuke.
In her role as
Komurasaki
, Hiyori used speech patterns typically associated with
oiran
: She ended most of her sentences with "de-arinsu"
(
でありんす
?
)
, a polite expression meaning "to be", and used the first-person pronouns
wachiki
(わちき) or
achiki
(あちき).
After abandoning the Komurasaki identity, she drops the verbal tic and switches to the neutral pronoun
watashi
(私).
Relationships
Family
Parents
Hiyori as an infant with her parents.
Hiyori loved her
parents
dearly and she became so traumatized by their deaths that she never spoke again for a long period of time. Hiyori is deeply respectful towards her father
Kouzuki Oden
as a
samurai
. Hiyori believed that as his daughter, she must not shame her father so she refused to live a submissive life. Even when threatened with death, Hiyori strongly refused to bow to
Kurozumi Orochi
, her father's archenemy and murderer.
Oden also reciprocated Hiyori's love and respect and upon his death bequeathed to Hiyori one of his swords,
Enma
. According to
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
, part of the reason Hiyori is willing to give Enma to
Roronoa Zoro
is due to seeing Oden's image in Zoro's abilities as a swordsman.
Kouzuki Momonosuke
Momonosuke and Hiyori playing.
As siblings, Hiyori cares deeply for her elder brother
Kouzuki Momonosuke
as she was searching for him for 20 years.
Hiyori was very excited to hear from
Roronoa Zoro
that Momonosuke is still alive and learns that he kept the promise she doubted years ago. Hiyori even excitedly questioned how he was doing but decided to wait until after
Kurozumi Orochi
was defeated to reunite.
As a child, she often performed drop kicks on Momonosuke as a prank. Momonosuke also respected Hiyori's decision to relinquish one of their
father
's swords,
Enma
, to Zoro. When he was about to be executed by
Kaidou
, Momonosuke's only regret was not being able to reunite with his sister.
After Momonosuke became the new shogun of
Wano
, Hiyori is moved with tears by her elder brother's speech right before she tearfully embraced him.
Despite this, Hiyori still has some of her childish personality as she still preferred to dropkick Momonosuke as a way of teasing him.
Allies
Toko
Toko is Hiyori's closest friend and confidant.
While Hiyori was the oiran
Komurasaki
,
Toko
served as her kamuro. Hiyori is very affectionate with her as she was worried when the latter went off to try
Sanji
's famous
soba
without informing her.
She tried to defend Toko from
Kurozumi Orochi
when the shogun tried to kill her for laughing at him. This led to Komurasaki getting "killed" by
Kyoshiro
. Hiyori tried to protect Toko again when Orochi sent
an assassin
after her and fled the
Flower Capital
with her.
Toko is also the only person who knows the truth about Hiyori and her
lineage
. Her cheerful and bright personality helped Hiyori to push forward.
When Toko received news of her
father
's impending execution, Hiyori immediately ran after the frantic girl out of concern for her safety.
After
Wano
was freed from the
Beasts Pirates
' control, Toko was allowed to move back to the Flower Capital where the two can live happily together.
Kawamatsu
Kawamatsu, Hiyori's savior and protector.
As one of the retainers of
Kouzuki Oden
,
Kawamatsu
became Hiyori's guardian after the death of her parents where Kawamatsu did everything he could to raise Hiyori and make her happy after she was deeply traumatized, including dancing and telling jokes to cheer her up. Hiyori has immense respect and gratitude towards Kawamatsu for his care and wished to reunite with him again before she finally smiled again after so long.
However, Hiyori left Kawamatsu as he was risking too much to take care of her, believing that it would be her fault if he ended up dying.
After reuniting with him after many years, they were extremely overjoyed to see each other again with Hiyori crying tears of joy.
Although she was somewhat annoyed that he still treated her like a child.
Also, she ignored his protest of not allowing
Roronoa Zoro
to have
Enma
.
Denjiro
As a member of the
Nine Red Scabbards
, Denjiro is one of the most loyal retainers of Hiyori's father
Kouzuki Oden
. When Hiyori met Denjiro while he was under the guise of "
Kyoshiro
", he was tearfully happy to see her alive and revealed his true identity to her. After learning about what happened with
Kawamatsu
, he took on the role as her second guardian and raised her, grooming her into geisha. In order to do so, he advised Hiyori to adopt the name he thought up for her "
Komurasaki
" to keep herself safe and hidden from the
Beasts Pirates
and
Kurozumi Orochi
.
Hiyori is also the only one who is aware of Denjiro's secret identity as the chivalrous thief
Ushimitsu Kozo
as she would give the money she swindled from corrupt men to Denjiro for him to secretly distribute to the poor. She was briefly worried and shocked when
Brook
claimed that Ushimitsu Kozo was captured by the authorities. During Orochi's banquet at the
Flower Capital
, Hiyori angered the shogun and Denjiro had to fake her death (as she carried a blood pouch inside her clothes) in what looks like a
samurai
's mercy and to prevent her from being married to Orochi.
He would later save her again at
Onigashima
when Orochi tried to kill her after she revealed her true identity to him.
Roronoa Zoro
Roronoa Zoro
is Hiyori's third savior and protector after
Kawamatsu
and
Denjiro
. When he rescued her from Kamazo, Hiyori was deeply awed by his strength that she healed his injuries and thanked him, speaking to him in a grateful manner.
After learning her name, Zoro reveals to her that her older brother
Kouzuki Momonosuke
is alive, indicating that he believes her.
Hiyori has also shown to trust Zoro very much, revealing her own identity to him, sleeping on top of him during a cold night and remaining with him after being chased by the
Oniwabanshu
. After learning that he had
Shusui
, Hiyori respectfully asked him to return it to its resting place, and offered her
father
's sword,
Enma
, a legendary blade that wounded
Kaidou
, as a replacement. She did not question him on how Shusui came to his possession, nor did she accuse him of its thievery, while offering Enma as replacement despite Kawamatsu's protest, furthering her trust in Zoro.
While Zoro was unconscious from the
raid on Onigashima
, Hiyori cleansed him and later asked Zoro if it was exciting for him.
Enemies
Kurozumi Orochi
Hiyori slapping Orochi for trying to kill Toko.
Hiyori feels immense hatred and disgust for
Kurozumi Orochi
as he was one of the main ones, along with
Kaidou
, responsible for the death of her father
Kouzuki Oden
. She was upset at how he had tricked her father into making a fool of himself, only to betray him and wrongfully execute him in the end.
Likewise, she hated him for his extreme cruelty, where he had brought misery to the poor people of Ebisu by feeding them defective
SMILEs
, so they couldn't express their sadness and pain even when in mourning. Through tears she said that it was the most heinous crime he had committed and she compared the situation to a real hell.
While in the Orochi's presence under her
Komurasaki
persona, Hiyori always acted with deep respect and love for the him.
Where she also sang his favorite song to him, and she was jealous when he flirted with
another
. However, when Orochi attacked
Toko
, Hiyori slapped him, causing the shogun to reveal that he wanted to make her his wife, but Hiyori said that she would rather die. Even when she was given the chance to beg for mercy, she continued to deny him, causing Orochi to lash out at her in a fit of rage; although she would be saved by
Denjiro
, faking her death before him.
After Orochi killed
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, she decided to kill him herself with her bare hands.
This leads her to disguise herself as Komurasaki once more to fool Orochi while using a
Seastone
nail to nullify his
Devil Fruit
powers, coldly revealing she never loved him, before proudly revealing her true identity as Oden's daughter. It is also revealed that every time she plays Orochi's favorite song the
Moon Princess
, she always wears a mask so she can hide her tears and rage as the song is also the favorite song of her late father.
Hiyori lets out her tears and rage after removing her mask.
When Orochi tries to trick her by saying that he had respected Oden as well, Hiyori is not swayed by his lies and reminds him of everything he put her father through. However, Orochi kept trying to convince her with the same thing, so Hiyori takes off her mask and proudly calls out her name with tears in her eyes. She stands before the horrified Orochi and declares that she was always proud to bear her father's name, while she denounces him for all the atrocities he committed and that he did not deserve to be shogun. When
Kurozumi Kanjuro
's
Kazenbo
appeared and accidentally burned Orochi, she just watched as he burned.
Unfortunately, when the seastone nail was later dislodged, the wounded Orochi decided to kill Hiyori and take her with him in his final act to spite Oden.
Besides joking that they would be in hell together; only for Denjiro to end up decapitating him.
When Orochi was still alive and told her that the Kurozumi clan would always curse the country of Wano, she fearlessly approached him and told him that: "Kurozumi was born to burn."
Bingo, Bongo and Bungo
Bingo
,
Bongo
and
Bungo
are three men who were all in love with Hiyori, under the guise as
Komurasaki
. When they met her individually, she would use their affections for her and make them give up all their
money
and personal belongings to gain her freedom.
Knowing the three were responsible for an arson ring and ruining the lives of several innocent people, Hiyori targeted them to get
justice
for those they harmed. Once she got all their money from them, she left them poor and unable to fend for themselves.
The three of them later tried to kill her for revenge only to be thwarted.
Because of her actions, the three are forced to live in
Ebisu Town
barely able to make a living.
Others
Flower Capital Citizens
The Flower Capital citizens fanatically sorrowful during Komurasaki's funeral.
Due to her great beauty, refined charisma and mannerism as the highest-ranking courtesan of Wano, Komurasaki was immensely popular among the citizens who live in the
Flower Capital
. She has been described by a old veteran courtesan as the dream of all men and perfection of all women in Wano with her fellow geishas also holding utmost respect for Komurasaki. While proceeding to
Orochi's palace
, many men and women gathered to see and cheer for Komurasaki while admiring her captivating beauty. They respectfully referred to her as "Komurasaki-sama".
After she was presumably killed by
Kyoshiro
, all the citizens were extremely sorrowful and mourned her death.
Following the
raid on Onigashima
, the public is now aware of her true identity as the daughter of
Kouzuki Oden
where they were overjoyed at this
and continue to admire her as well.
Colleagues
Under her alias
Komurasaki
, all of Hiyori's colleagues particularly her fellow geishas held immense respect and admiration for Hiyori due to her unmatched beauty, charisma and skills as a geisha. Many of her subordinates also found great amusement in Hiyori swindling corrupt men of their wealth as they laughed hysterically at
Bingo
, mocking him for letting his lust delude him into thinking Hiyori truly fell for him, giving away all his wealth to Hiyori in the process. Hiyori's fellow geishas were all also horrified and saddened when
Kyoshiro
seemingly killed Hiyori as punishment for going against
Kurozumi Orochi
.
Abilities and Powers
Physical Abilities
Hiyori seems to have great balance and leg strength to walk with extremely tall geta sandals without any strain, although she did have to put her hand on her guard to do so. She also owned a fair amount of arm strength as she slapped the extremely large
Kurozumi Orochi
with enough force to leave a mark.
As a child, she is already strong and agile enough to perform drop kicks on her older brother
Kouzuki Momonosuke
. She is also extremely agile as she can change her position mid-air when she jumps to dropkick on Momonosuke. As an adult, she is still strong and agile enough to dropkick Momonosuke, even after he becomes an adult as well.
Deception and Trickery
Hiyori has shown to be an extremely crafty manipulator using her beauty in conjunction with superior acting skills to deceive some corrupt men into giving her all their wealth.
With
Denjiro
's assistance, she was able to fool
Kurozumi Orochi
and all those who attended the banquet into believing that she died by carrying fake blood packs.
During the
raid on Onigashima
, while Orochi carelessly listened to her music, Hiyori secretly placed a
Seastone
nail on him just so he will not transform.
Musical Skills
Hiyori is very skilled with the shamisen.
Ever since she was a child, Hiyori practiced playing the
shamisen
and continued to do so during her training as a geisha, proving herself to be an extremely talented
musician
. This was shown when she played a song so enchanting, it deeply captivated
Kurozumi Orochi
, his guests, and her fellow courtesans.
Medical Skills
Hiyori possesses some degree of
medical skill
, as she was able to treat a large shoulder wound
Roronoa Zoro
got from
Kamazo
.
History
Past
Early Childhood
Hiyori was born 26 years ago to
Kouzuki Oden
and
Kouzuki Toki
while they were on
Whitebeard Pirates
'
ship
.
After Oden encountered
Gol D. Roger
and decided to assist him with his final journey, Hiyori then boarded the
Oro Jackson
with her parents and
older brother
.
Sometime after the
Roger Pirates
' visit to
Fish-Man Island
, Toki became ill. When the crew reached
Wano Country
, Hiyori left the crew with her mother and brother and stayed behind at Wano.
After Toki recovered from her illness, she and her children became beloved figures of the
Kuri
region. After Oden returned to Wano, the family welcomed him back. At Oden Castle, Oden was being informed about Orochi's abuse of power and
Raizo
was ordered to take Hiyori and Momonosuke out of the room before Oden was told about the
Beasts Pirates
' attempted attack on his family.
Hiyori watched as her father began to publicly humiliate himself by dancing almost naked in front of the shogun's castle once a week, which made him lose the respect of most of the people of Wano and they spoke ill of him. This saddened her and she asked her father if she didn't mind the rumors about him. However, he had replied that he did not care about her, since she had her family; then Hiyori was very happy and told him that they would be there for him too.
20 years ago, while Oden and the
Scabbards
fought the Beasts Pirates in the
Udon
region, Hiyori, Momonosuke, and Toki stayed in Oden Castle while they were guarded by
Shimotsuki Yasuie
and his men.
On the day of Oden's execution, Hiyori was having a meal with her mother and brother and she was concerned when Momonosuke started crying.
Life in Hiding
Kawamatsu takes care of Hiyori.
After
Kouzuki Oden
was executed
in the
Flower Capital
by
Kurozumi Orochi
and
Kaidou
, Hiyori was in Oden Castle with her mother and brother, set it ablaze.
Kouzuki Toki
used her
Devil Fruit powers
to send
Kouzuki Momonosuke
and four of their retainers 20 years forward in time, leaving Hiyori remaining with her.
Kawamatsu
then helped Hiyori escape from the castle and took care of her by providing her with food and cheering her up when she was sad, even though he himself was hungry. Although she was initially mute, she eventually began to laugh. After seven years
, Hiyori couldn't watch Kawamatsu getting hungrier as he fed her all the food he could get his hands on. Worried that he would starve to death because of her, she decided to run away.
Before that, she wrote him a letter saying thanking him for everything and that she was going to be okay.
Hiyori working as a geisha, first a kamuro and eventually an oiran.
Hiyori was brought outside Kyoshiro's residence after being found on the streets of the Flower Capital. The yakuza boss brought Hiyori in and revealed his true identity of
Denjiro
to her. He then raised her for the next 13 years, grooming her as a geisha under the alias
Komurasaki
. Hiyori dutifully worked as a Kamuro and trained herself earnestly as a geisha.
Eventually, she was promoted into an oiran, the highest ranking geisha, deeply respected and idolized in the Flower Capital for her immense beauty and charisma, which also earned her the favor of Orochi.
One day, Hiyori courted
Bingo
,
Bongo
and
Bungo
, claiming to want her freedom purchased before the shogun Orochi took her and agreeing to go with each man if they managed to do this. The men gave up everything they had to raise the
money
, which they put in her possession. However, she had deceived them and left them with nothing,
putting an end to their criminal activities in the process.
She gave the money she took from them to Kyoshiro for him to distribute to the poor. Due to Orochi falling in love with Komurasaki, Denjiro advised Hiyori to carry fake blood under her kimono so he could fake her death if the situation requires it.
Wano Country Saga
Wano Country Arc
"Komurasaki's" procession begins.
Komurasaki was called by
Kurozumi Orochi
to perform her services at his banquet. She made her way through the streets of the
Flower Capital
as the citizens gazed at her in awe, and she was joined by her kamuro
Toko
who had come late to the procession.
She was then confronted by
Bingo
,
Bongo
and
Bungo
, who tried to kill her to avenge their destitution, but her guard defeated them. As the three men cried in anguish, she mocked and degraded them as she walked away from them. She later made it to
Orochi's palace
.
Kyoshiro strikes down "Komurasaki".
At the banquet hall, she sat next to Orochi who arrived to start the celebration.
There, Komurasaki played some music for the shogun before returning to his side. Orochi then talked about the impending return of
Kouzuki Oden
's
Nine Red Scabbards
and son
Momonosuke
, to which she was shocked when Toko laughed at him. She pleaded with Orochi not to attack her kamuro, but he did not listen, forcing her to slap him. She refused to prostrate herself in apology and Orochi angrily transformed into the
Yamata no Orochi
.
After she once again refused to apologize, Orochi attacked her and wrested her into one of his mouths. However, she was dislodged from Orochi's grip when the ceiling crashed onto the shogun's head. She then faced
Kyoshiro
who slashed her with the appearance of killing her.
Zoro saves Hiyori and Toko from Kamazo.
With "Komurasaki" considered dead by everyone, Hiyori escaped and reunited with Toko and they fled the Flower Capital as Toko was pursued by Orochi's
assassin
Kamazo
. They were chased to
Ringo
, and as they came to Oihagi Bridge, Hiyori pleaded for the
swordsman
Roronoa Zoro
and the
samurai
Gyukimaru
to help. She agreed to Zoro's request for food and alcohol in return and watched as he battled Kamazo. She was shocked when Kamazo pierced Zoro through the shoulder, but Zoro then managed to strike down the assassin.
Zoro then fell unconscious from his wound and Hiyori took him to a house in the Northern Cemetery to treat it. When Zoro woke up, he attempted to leave immediately and Hiyori held him back, accidentally aggravating his wound. Hiyori then gave Zoro his food and alcohol before she told him about Gyukimaru as well as what had happened to her and Toko. She then revealed her own identity and that she was looking for her brother Momonosuke.
After Zoro was shocked to learn that she is Momonosuke's younger sister, Hiyori expressed joy in learning that her brother is alive. After receiving confirmation that Zoro was an ally, Hiyori told him of her past, including how
Kawamatsu
rescued her from the destruction of Oden Castle and raised her until she was 13 and how Toko is an important friend to her. Hiyori and Zoro proceeded to talk about the current status of the
alliance
including the whereabouts of each of the Nine Red Scabbards. After their conversation, Hiyori wondered if she should meet her brother.
Hiyori and Toko then slept with Zoro before they later woke up to meet
Brook
. After getting acquainted with each other, Brook told the group about Komurasaki's funeral as well as the capture of
Tonoyasu
and his impending execution. Toko rushed off to save him, causing Hiyori, Zoro and Brook to run after her.
Hiyori tearfully explains to Zoro why the Ebisu residents are laughing at Yasuie's death.
The group later arrived at the prison in the
Rasetsu Town
just in time to witness the execution. When the people from
Ebisu Town
were crying and smiling, Hiyori explained to Zoro that they were actually devastated but could only smile because of the
SMILE
fruits.
She explained more about the work of Orochi in robbing the people of Ebisu Town of their emotions before noticing Toko beside her father's body. Hiyori desperately cried out to Toko, telling her to come back, but Orochi spotted her. She then told Toko to run, but Orochi started shooting at her. Fortunately, Zoro and
Sanji
shielded the girl.
Hiyori then wondered if Sanji was Zoro's comrade. During the ensuing chaos, Hiyori witnessed Zoro clashing with Kyoshiro.
After she saw
Usopp
fleeing with Toko, Brook told Hiyori to escape as well. However, as she was fleeing, she was pursued by
Fujin
and
Raijin
since she was seen with Zoro. Just when they were about to capture her, Zoro came and rescued her.
Hiyori and Zoro fled to a forest outside the capital, but they were still pursued by members of the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
. Hiyori hid in the Enma Shrine as Zoro defeated their pursuers. After Zoro explained his intention to avenge Yasuie, Hiyori expressed her desire to kill Orochi herself.
Hiyori then returned to Oihagi Bridge with Zoro and watched him fight Gyukimaru again. She was surprised when she heard
Shusui
being mentioned. Kawamatsu interrupted the fight and Hiyori was glad to see him again. However, the reunion was interrupted when some Beasts Pirates arrived seeking revenge on Gyukimaru for stealing their weapons.
After the Beasts Pirates were defeated, Hiyori got reacquainted with Kawamatsu, who told her of his ordeals after they separated. He told her of the story of
Shimotsuki Ushimaru
and his fox companion Onimaru, who Kawamatsu was paired with defending Ringo until he was captured. They caught up with Zoro at a passageway leading to an underground chamber where Kawamatsu kept a stash of weapons. Hiyori then respectfully asked Zoro to return Shusui in exchange for
Enma
, a sword that was once wielded by her father.
Ignoring Kawamatsu's objections towards giving away Enma, Hiyori proceeded to explain more about the two swords that were in Oden's possession. She once again implored Zoro to return Shusui, and Zoro agreed with her condition.
While Kawamatsu and Zoro headed off to Amigasa Village, Hiyori refused to join them as she did not want to reunite their allies yet.
Hiyori leaves Orochi trapped under rubble.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Hiyori hid within the tribute that Orochi brought to
Onigashima
and was placed in one of the rooms of the Treasure Repository.
After
Law
teleported
the Nine Red Scabbards into the Treasure Repository after their fight with Kaidou, Hiyori tended to their wounds.
Before the Scabbards woke up, she went back into hiding. During his treatment, Kawamatsu thought he recognized her and mistook it for a dream, thinking it couldn't be true.
Later that night, when Orochi took shelter in the Treasure Repository, Hiyori—once more dressed as Komurasaki—began playing her shamisen and greeted Orochi as he crawled into the room.
As he laid next to her, Orochi requested that she play
his favorite song
while he waited for
Fukurokuju
.
Unbeknownst to Orochi, Hiyori had planted a
Seastone
nail on him while he was distracted in order to neutralize his
Devil Fruit
powers.
Suddenly, the island began to shake, but she ignored it.
Orochi was enraged when he saw that
Fukurokuju
hasn't arrived yet, then got angry at Hiyori for continuing to play and ordered her to stop as well as ordering her to remove her mask, doubting her identity. Suddenly, the ceiling collapsed and Orochi was trapped under the rubble, wondering why he couldn't transform, to which she was amused. When Orochi asked her to help him, Hiyori explained how she managed to immobilize him, and after Orochi asked why she did that if she loved him to which Hiyori teased him, revealing that the song was also one of her father's favorites, Kouzuki Oden.
Orochi immediately told Hiyori that he respected Oden as well, stating that
Kaidou
was using him the whole time and begging him to remove the nail so they could run away together, but she asked if he still thought he's tricking someone. Hiyori reminded him how her father kept her promise to him and Kaidou, without telling anyone about it, and she added that he always believed that the entire country would be liberated, even in his execution. Orochi told him that Oden was a great samurai and should be respected as a shogun. However, Hiyori removed her mask, where she tearfully told him to shut up and revealed her real name. She revealed to him that even when she was without food and dressed in rags, she defended her father's honor and that she never saw Orochi as a shogun, but as a pathetic madman who killed innocent people. As Orochi kept begging her to help him,
Kurozumi Kanjuro
's
Kazenbo
appears. The shogun ordered it to burn Hiyori to ruin her revenge plan from twenty years ago, while taunting her. However, Kazenbo approached Orochi, burning him while Hiyori, seeing him, said that the
dawn
will come. Orochi begged her again to save him, but she told him that the Kouzuki family would always keep its promises.
Denjiro saves Hiyori.
Unfortunately, the later shaking throughout Onigashima had dislodged the nail from Orochi, allowing him to transform again. There he made the decision to take Hiyori with him as a final act to annoy Oden.
He declared to Hiyori that she shouldn't have underestimated the
Kurozumi Family
's anger, adding that the two of them could drink together in hell. However, unexpectedly, Denjiro arrived, beheading Orochi and hugging Hiyori,
congratulating her for staying strong all these years, making her cry.
Suddenly, however, Orochi was still alive, who continued to threaten her, telling her that the Kurozumi family would curse all of Wano forever. Despite Denjiro telling her to be careful, she approached Orochi saying, "Kurozumi was born to burn.", after which Orochi would then finally die from the fire.
As Onigashima landed,
Nekomamushi
announced that
Monkey D. Luffy
had defeated Kaidou and that Momonosuke had facilitated the fall of the island. After the latter announced in his dragon form to all the citizens of the Flower Capital that Kaidou's rule has ended, Hiyori and all of the Kouzuki Retainers arrived to calm the panicking citizens. Then, all the citizens recognized her and Denjiro by their false identities where the latter announced to them the new shogun, Kouzuki Momonosuke.
As they walked, Kin'emon pointed out to Hiyori and Denjiro how famous they have become; wondering if the rest of them would also be recognized by the citizens. Their emergence was then broadcast throughout the country. When Momonosuke arrived in his human form, Hiyori and all the retainers bowed to him. After Momonosuke took his speech to the entire country and proclaimed himself the new shogun, Hiyori cried with joy and hugged him.
A week later, Hiyori announced to Momonosuke that Luffy and Zoro had woken up, also kicking him in the face like when they were children; where he then he joined the banquet with everyone else. As Zoro realized that he was clean, Hiyori revealed that she was the one who cleaned him up and asked if he was happy. She then joined the other women in a bathroom, conversing with
Kikunojo
while taking a bath.
She would later join the festival in the Flower Capital, playing Moon Princess for the first time without her mask along with Brook.
After the festival ended, she returned to the shogun's palace along with Momonosuke and some Scabbards where Tenguyama revealed to her and Momonosuke that he was their grandfather,
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
. When they hugged him, he apologized to them, but both Hiyori and Momonosuke were relieved to learn that they had another living relative; so she asked him not to apologize. Then, Sukiyaki told the Scabbards not to tell anyone about his identity, saying that he wanted them to forge the new age, to which they agreed.
Days later, she and Toko were practicing the shamisen when Momonosuke rushed in searching for the Straw Hats. Hiyori informed him that they had already said their goodbyes and departed that morning.
Soon after, Hiyori and Toko played the shamisen in an auditorium while the new school teacher told the story of the
raid on Onigashima
.
