Personality
[

Dagama is a very shady and untrustworthy person
and will do whatever it takes to win, especially in service of his king,
Elizabello II
.
He plotted with and bribed the other competitors in his block to gain the upper hand but then betrayed and attacked them.
He is also extremely greedy as he was willing to betray the the people that saved him in order to get the prize money, though a scolding from his king managed to change his mind to be more grateful.
However, he redeemed himself when he rallied the colosseum top fighters to fight as one and even held back
Dellinger
so that
Cavendish
,
Monkey D. Luffy
, and
Kyros
could safely pass the Donquixote Pirate officers.
Like many other characters, Dagama has a distinctive laugh, "Gamahahahahah!" which sounds similar to his own name.

History
[

Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
He came from the
Prodence Kingdom
with his king,
Elizabello II
, to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
at the
Corrida Colosseum
in
Dressrosa
. He argued with the Funk Brothers,
Kelly
and
Bobby
, after they called him out on trying to plot with the other competitors. He then stated that the country that wins the Mera Mera no Mi would gain massive leverage when it came to diplomatic relations and the threat of war, before mentioning the names a few big name fighters.
Dagama, along with Elizabello, Lepanto and several allies in the B Block.
As B Block was about to start, he entered the arena, along with all other B Block contestants. After
Bartolomeo
scared the audience with a fake bomb, Dagama scolded him and told him that he was making himself unpopular. As the fight started, Dagama teamed up with
Elizabello II
,
Tank Lepanto
, and several other fighters to take out some of their adversaries. Elizabello asked Dagama whether they should take out
Bellamy
first, to which Dagama agreed, and stated that they should take out the biggest threats first before their numbers decrease. When Bartolomeo and
Bellamy
complained about it, Dagama simply told them that the ends justify the means.
Dagama and his allied gladiators guarded Elizabello so he could defeat their competition with his devastating punch. While Lepanto took on Bellamy, Dagama urged his allies to attack
Blue Gilly
.
However, once the number of competitors dropped below twenty-four, Dagama revealed that the
longleg
was a secret ally.
Dagama defeated by Blue Gilly.
After that, Dagama and Blue Gilly started to attack the allied group of gladiators from behind. After defeating some of them, Dagama sarcastically thanked them and said he would give them their reward later if they wished. He then said that fighters who did not use their brain could only serve as pawns and told Blue Gilly to take out the remainder of them. As soon as Blue Gilly turned his back to him, Dagama immediately tried to take Blue Gilly out as well, but Blue Gilly instead took him out with a kick, which pushed him out of the ring where he was then attacked by a fighting fish.
Dagama and Elizabello were supposed to receive treatment for their injuries but instead, they were thrown into an underground dungeon filled with broken
toys
, along with some of the other disqualified participants. Enraged by
Donquixote Doflamingo
's trickery, Dagama urged his king to declare war on him.
Shortly afterwards, Ricky revealed himself to be the former king of Dressrosa,
Riku Doldo III
. While Elizabello was happy to see his old friend, Dagama was not so pleased because of the wars that plagued various countries due to Doflamingo's weapons trading after Doldo's disappearance and Doflamingo's ascension to the throne. He was about to curse Doldo, but he was angrily interrupted by Lepanto.
Dagama was later
transformed into a toy
and put to work in the underground trade port. While witnessing
Usopp
's confrontation with
Tr√©bol
and
Sugar
, Dagama begged Usopp to succeed, saying that he would offer him money.
When Sugar lost consciousness, her curse broke and the toys returned to their original forms.
He stood alongside the former slaves as Usopp was hailed as their savior.
Dagama with Luffy, Zoro, Law, Ucy and the other Corrida Colosseum combatants are on their way for Doflamingo.
After Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his
"Birdcage"
, he and his king returned to the surface. Dagama received a scolding and beating from Elizabello for wanting to get the prize money that Doflamingo was offering. When they found
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Roronoa Zoro
, and
Trafalgar Law
, they joined forces with them alongside the
Chinjao Family
,
Hajrudin
,
Ideo
,
Cavendish
,
Ucy
,
Abdullah
,
Jeet
, Blue Gilly,
Orlumbus
, and
Suleiman
. When some of the former toys came for the heads of Luffy, Zoro, and Law, the allied colosseum fighters fought them off. They later marched towards the palace and began to battle against
Pica
, who appeared as a
massive stone giant
. When Pica attacked,
Chinjao
and Elizabello II shattered his stone hand, enabling the group to move forward.
Dagama and the other allied fighters fought through Doflamingo's troops. Pica then attacked with his other arm, causing Dagama and some of the other allies to fall back. After avoiding Pica's strike, they were surprised to see Luffy, Zoro, Law, Abdullah, Jeet, and Ucy climbing on Pica's arm. They were also amazed when Luffy shattered Pica's stone head. When Pica's giant stone body stopped moving, Dagama and his allies continued on with their assault.
Dagama is pierced by Dellinger.
With Zoro fighting Pica and
Sabo
fighting the
Marines
, the colosseum fighters charged up the new King's Plateau and easily defeated the
Donquixote Pirates
' troops standing in their way.
After reaching the second level, the colosseum fighters were confronted by five of the Donquixote Pirate officers:
Dellinger
,
Gladius
,
Lao G
,
Machvise
, and
Baby 5
. During the skirmish, Baby 5 attacked Dagama with
Revolver Leg
. Dagama later banded the colosseum fighters together in order to fight their enemies and create an opening for Luffy and Cavendish. Dellinger, realizing who was the mastermind behind the colosseum fighters' new strategy, launched himself at and impaled Dagama. Dagama remained conscious and grabbed onto Dellinger, shouting for Luffy and the others to proceed onward.
Dagama and the other gladiators defeat the remaining Donquixote Pirates.
During the final phase of Doflamingo's game, Dagama and the other injured gladiators were temporarily
healed
by
Mansherry
. They then defeated the remaining Donquixote Pirates on the New King's Plateau to help the citizens flee from the shrinking Birdcage.
When the Birdcage came close to the central streets, the gladiators work together to push back the Birdcage via Bartolomeo's
barrier
.
Eventually, the effects of Mansherry's healing powers began to wear off and Dagama collapsed.
His efforts were not in vain as Luffy was bought enough time to defeat Doflamingo and bring down the Birdcage.
Dagama later returned to Prodence Kingdom along with Elizabello.
