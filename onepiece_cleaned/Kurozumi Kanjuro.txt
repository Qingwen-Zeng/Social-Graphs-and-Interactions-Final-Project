Kurozumi Kanjuro
, nicknamed
"Evening Shower" Kanjuro
,
was a
samurai
from
Wano Country
and a member of the
Kurozumi Family
. After losing his parents, he was instructed by
Kurozumi Orochi
to operate undercover within the
Kouzuki Family
. Kanjuro became
Kouzuki Oden
's retainer and one of the
Nine Red Scabbards
while secretly aiding Orochi in his rise to power and efforts to eliminate the Kouzuki bloodline, by feeding him information.
He would continue to do so until he revealed himself as Orochi's spy just before the
Raid on Onigashima
, leading to his former comrades engaging in battle with him until he was lethally wounded by
Kin'emon
during a final skirmish, dubbing it his final act.
He was born 54 years before the present day, but traveled 20 years forward in time when he was 34 years old.
He acted as an ally to the
Straw Hat Pirates
in his undercover role during the
Dressrosa Arc
and
Zou Arc
, but was revealed to be a major antagonist of the
Wano Country Arc
during its third act.
Appearance
[
]
Kanjuro's appearance matched the stereotype of a traditional
Kabuki
performer. He had bright long red hair down to the floor with the front hair sticking outward and down to his chest, with big lips and blush marks on his cheek in a similar manner to
Bentham
.
He was rather tall, standing at 347 cm.
He wore a traditional samurai outfit with a ribbon in the middle and zori for footwear. On his back, Kanjuro carried a large brush which he kept in readiness for use with his powers, or as a staff.
As a retainer of the
Kouzuki Family
, he bore the crest somewhere on his body.
Personality
[
]
According to Orochi, due to Kanjuro being raised in the theatre, his main purpose in life was to act as someone else. Due to his parents dying during the persecution of his family, Kanjuro wished to avenge them and then die. Kanjuro played the role of a loyal retainer to the Kouzuki Family so that he would eventually be killed with them.
In his role as a Kouzuki retainer, Kanjuro acted quite selflessly, since he encouraged Kin'emon to leave him behind and pursue Momonosuke.
Kanjuro was also very calm and level headed, as he reprimanded Shinobu for being too rash in resolving unexpected setbacks. However, there are times where he can act absent-minded, such as when he created a net for the citizens of Dressrosa to climb up the old King's Plateau, not knowing they were aiming to capture
Usopp
and
King Riku
.
He also fooled around during the escalade of
Zunesha
's leg and failed to realize that
Bariete
was falling towards him, hitting
Kin'emon
and him and making them fall off the elephant.
He also acted overzealous at times. For instance, when he realized he put Usopp in danger, he stated he would cut open his own stomach as compensation. However, he quickly decided against such actions when Kin'emon told him not to.
Kanjuro's true nature.
However, due to his complete loyalty to the Kurozumi Family, he did not develop any genuine attachment to the Kouzuki Family despite all the moments they shared together. Once Orochi ordered him to drop the charade and bring Momonosuke to Onigashima, Kanjuro did so without hesitation, revealing his true identity to those who thought of him as a comrade. He did not show remorse for his actions, even though they caused turmoil to their alliance and emotional pain to the other Nine Red Scabbards, particularly Kin'emon, for betraying their trust and friendship.
Upon revealing his true nature, Kanjuro showed to be merciless and sadistic. Before departing for Onigashima, he abducted Momonosuke and attacked the Kouzuki samurai. He also taunted his former friend
Kawamatsu
by threatening to kill Hiyori, and mocked his former allies' attempted revolution. When Momonosuke tried to escape, Kanjuro brutally beat him to the point of unconsciousness and casually handed him over to Orochi and Kaidou justifying himself because the boy had cut his hand, even referring to him as a little brat, thereby ungratefully disregarding the kindness and care Oden and the child had showed him.
Even worse, while the Red Scabbards held back on him due to their lingering camaraderie, he showed neither reciprocation nor gratitude as he sadistically created a painted clone of Oden to launch a brutal psychological attack against them, while taunting them of killing Momonosuke despite his own wounds.
As a Kouzuki retainer, Kanjuro referred to himself with
soregashi
(
それがし
?
)
, an archaic personal pronoun used by samurai. After revealing his true loyalties, he switches to
ore
(
おれ
?
)
, an informal personal pronoun commonly used by men.
Like most other characters in the series, he has a unique
Laughter Style
: "Ka, ka, ka"
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Kanjuro loved his parents and was devastated when they were killed. Afterwards, he found his relatives
Kurozumi Orochi
,
Higurashi
, and
Semimaru
and gladly began working with them to avenge their family's persecution and put Orochi in power. He served them unwaveringly for at least 21 years in his role as a spy, and Orochi considered him to be very trustworthy as he supplied them with information about the Kouzuki Family's activities and alerted him to their survival in the present day.
When they met for the first time in decades, Kanjuro bowed to Orochi while the latter expressed great praise for Kanjuro for successfully abducting Momonosuke and was amused by his heartlessness towards the boy by beating him unconscious. Kanjuro also wasted no time in alerting him of the raid.
Kouzuki Family
[
]
Kanjuro was an enemy of the Kouzuki Family due to his involvement in Orochi's plot against them. However, until revealing his plot prior to the raid on
Onigashima
, he was considered to be a trusted servant who was respected by his master
Kouzuki Oden
and his fellow retainers. For much of his life, Kanjuro's intention was to die as a Kouzuki, and so he played his role so well that he aided them in battle against the Beasts Pirates and 20 years later, he aided Kin'emon in
Dressrosa
by helping him escape
Doflamingo
's guards. He was even willing to be executed with them due to his desire for death.
According to Kanjuro, he did not hate Oden and his fellow retainers and never meant to harm them. He only worked against them when commanded to by Orochi. He ultimately dropped his charade when they were heading to raid Onigashima and were about to be attacked by the Beasts Pirates' fleet. He then captured Oden's son
Momonosuke
to bring him to Onigashima as directed by Orochi. Kanjuro pointed out that his fellow retainers should have had a stronger suspicion of a spy in their midst, but did not really treat them with scorn or derision. Although the other retainers had wondered about the potential for a spy, they were utterly shocked and brought to tears by his betrayal, with
Kin'emon
quickly attempting to kill him in response.
When he met them again, he stated he knew their tenacity well and wasted no time gloating about beating Momonosuke in front of them. This deplorable attitude caused Kikunojo to confront him and he gladly accepted her challenge.
Although Kanjuro stated he did not hate the Kouzuki, he did not develop any true bonds with them due to his loyalty to the Kurozumi Family. Kanjuro did not hesitate to lead the family to various dangerous situations via his information leaks and despite his motive to play the "perfect" role as a Kouzuki retainer, he kept many of his true talents hidden away from them until he revealed his true allegiance, which angered Kin'emon even more for his lack of honesty. Kanjuro also did not hesitate to abduct Momonosuke and bring him to Onigashima, while claiming he would hunt down and kill Hiyori, infuriating
Kawamatsu
. As a hypocritical throwback of his earlier claim of not hating the family, he mocked Oden and Toki's deaths, derogatorily called Kawamatsu a 'fish-man' instead of his real name while flaunting his intention of killing Hiyori in front of him, and insulting Momonosuke's cowardice and weaknesses, while ignoring the boy's pleas to stop harming their allies.
He also brutally beat Momonosuke until he was unconscious when he attempted to flee from him and called him a brat as he handed him to Orochi, showing just how much contempt he held towards the Kouzuki line.
In spite of his treachery, Kanjuro's former allies still expressed sadness for him after his defeat.
However, such sentiments did not go both ways, as while the Scabbards held back out of their camaraderie for him, Kanjuro went as far as using a painted creation of Oden against them, causing them severe psychological grief that ended with
Ashura
dying from a massive explosion, all the while taunting them with the threat of killing Momonosuke. This act of cruelty revitalized the Scabbards' hatred for Kanjuro.
However, even after Kanjuro attempted a second time to disguise as Oden, which led
Kiku
to once again drop her guard as she could not bring herself to harm her savior despite knowing it was a fake, Kin'emon still shed tears when he was forced to strike down Kanjuro a second time.
Wano Country Citizens
[
]
Much like Orochi, Kanjuro also held incredible hatred towards the citizens of Wano for unfairly persecuting the Kurozumi Family as his parents were also killed due to their self-righteous persecution. Thus, Kanjuro had no qualms supporting Orochi in overthrowing the Kouzuki shogunate, which led to Wano falling into decadence and ruin due to Orochi's tyranny, and sabotaging the Kouzuki revolution by providing Orochi information. He attempted to undermine
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's efforts to give the alliance a second chance and did not hesitate in expressing how Yasuie supposedly died for nothing in front of the Nine Red Scabbards, disregarding the kindness he received from the former
daimyo
. Kanjuro declared that all of the Kouzuki samurai loyalists should have died twenty years ago, claiming that Toki's prophecy simply postponed their imminent deaths. Before he departed for Onigashima, Kanjuro ruthlessly attacked the Kouzuki samurai along with their ships in a last ditch effort for revenge.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Physical Abilities
[
]
Kanjuro had immense strength, able to easily carry around and use his
giant ink brush
without tiring, and could equally clash with
Kawamatsu
, a
fish-man
with ten times the physical strength of an average human. By imbuing his brush with
Armament Haki
, Kanjuro was able to help push back and significantly slow down the contraction speed of
Doflamingo
's
Torikago
, along with many other powerful combatants. During his journey through
Onigashima
, he took down several members of the
Beasts Pirates
with no effort. Even after being cut down twice with fatal injuries, Kanjuro was still able to continue attacking and drawing, although he would eventually succumb to his wounds.
Craftsmanship
[
]
Kanjuro had some skills in brush making, as he used the hair of people and corpses to make brushes for a living.
Artistry
[
]
When operating with the Kouzuki Family, Kanjuro pretended that he was very bad at drawing, producing only poorly-drawn, barely functional constructs by using his left hand.
However, he was actually an extremely skilled artist, able to draw life-like creatures, including human beings. Despite having spent years acting like a mediocre artist, his true skills did not deteriorate, as he was able to produce perfect drawings once he ceased his act. The speed and precision of Kanjuro's artistry were also impressive, as he was able to draw a large crane in an instant.
Acting Skills
[
]
Due to being raised in a theater troupe, Kanjuro was a consummate actor - a talent further improved by his lack of individuality as stated by Orochi. He was able to perfectly pose as a loyal retainer of the Kouzuki Family for 21 years, fully adapting to his new identity and even faked genuine emotions such as sorrow at the death of Oden and later Yasuie despite not having any attachments to them in the first place. He also hid his true skills from them, giving them the facade of an amateur artist who could not make full use of his Devil Fruit's potential, in order to give himself a strategic advantage despite the risk he put them (himself included) through when his purposely poor drawings caused them to nearly fall off Zunesha. Although some events raised suspicions of a traitor in the family's midst, no family member or retainer ever suspected that Kanjuro was the spy until he told them.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Fude Fude no Mi
Kanjuro bringing a drawing to life.
Kanjuro ate the Fude Fude no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allowed him to generate ink that he can use to draw pictures and manifest and control anything he drew. His three-dimensional drawings had the same abilities as the things they are depicting; a drawing of a bird is able to fly, and a drawing of food is edible (although, according to
Kin'emon
, it hurts his stomach). He could create ink from his long hair and draw with it, or channel his power through his giant ink brush.
Kanjuro could use this power to create a variety of useful constructs; such as creating ladders to climb out of a deep pit, or by creating animals who abilities would prove helpful. His created animals were as capable as real ones, if not more, such as snakes with powerful constricting strength, or elegant flying cranes. Furthermore, Kanjuro hid his powers' more potent usages from the Kouzuki Family, such as generating ink from his hair to create a rain of hardened ink droplets.
Provided he knows the person whose effigy he is drawing, Kanjuro could make the drawing's voice identical to that of the person, which allowed him to create a perfect replica of
Kouzuki Oden
that actually managed to fool most of the other Scabbards.
When the Nine Red Scabbards sailed out to Onigashima to confront Kaidou, Kanjuro sent a perfectly drawn clone of himself with them, with none of them noticing until Kin'emon decapitated the drawing.
Kanjuro could also combine his acting skills with his paintings to create psychological attacks, as he did so by animating a painting of Kouzuki Oden and using his knowledge of the daimyo's personality to create a persuasive illusion of him. This deception managed to catch the Nine Red Scabbards off guard, and when the truth was discovered, they were psychologically wounded. The clone was also strapped with
dynamite
, creating a walking bomb that was strong enough to kill
Ashura Doji
.
Kanjuro could apply a layer of ink over himself to create a full-body disguise similar to the drawn effigy.
Kanjuro's power could also affect his own body, as he hid inside a wall as a drawing to avoid detection.
Weapons
[

Further information:
Tsuji Shibai
Tsuji Shibai.
To increase the versatility of his Devil Fruit powers, Kanjuro kept a giant ink brush named Tuji Shibai with him. It had a katana hilt and guard, with a tassel tied to the pommel. He wielded it in a manner similar to a sword, instead of how one would hold a brush.
During his youth, Kanjuro used a sword to cut hair off from people and corpses in order to use them to make brushes.

Kanjuro could use
Armament Haki
, known in Wano as "Ryuo", which he used to reinforce his ink brush to help Zoro and Kin'emon push back the Birdcage. Kanjuro's Armament Haki was strong enough to defend against the Birdcage's razor sharp threads that can easily slice cannon balls, meteorites, and large buildings.

Kanjuro possessed the ability to use

History

Past
[
]
Kanjuro meets Oden.
Kanjuro was born and raised in a popular theatre troupe. However, his parents were killed onstage one day due to being members of the
Kurozumi Family
. Kanjuro drifted and ultimately found his relatives
Kurozumi Orochi
,
Higurashi
, and
Semimaru
. They revealed that they killed the murderers of Kanjuro's parents and needed his help. To ensure he could aid in Orochi's plot to overthrow the
Kouzuki Family
and become the shogun, Orochi gave Kanjuro the
Fude Fude no Mi
to eat and instructed him to live as a Kouzuki member up until his death. Since he sought death, Kanjuro readily agreed.
At age 13, he was in
Kibi
. While stealing hair from either people or corpses to make brushes and sell them to make a living, Kanjuro attempted to steal Oden's, resulting in the Kouzuki defeating him and Kanjuro following him.
After Oden became daimyo of
Kuri
, Kanjuro became one of his retainers.
Six years later, after
Inuarashi
,
Nekomamushi
, and
Kawamatsu
joined Oden, they were running low on funds. Therefore, he and the other retainers attempted to steal money from
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, but they were caught. Instead of punishing them, Yasuie allowed them to take the money and encouraged them to use it to become better people for the sake of Oden and
Wano Country
. Following Yasuie's advice, they educated themselves and trained to become dignified warriors. 30 years ago, they visited the
Flower Capital
with Oden.
Orochi would frequently ask for money from Oden, and when Oden obliged, Kanjuro would secretly give Orochi double the requested amount.
After meeting the
Whitebeard Pirates
, Oden and his retainers were having a feast with them. Oden said that he wanted to join the crew, but Kanjuro,
Kin'emon
,
Raizo
, and
Denjiro
spoke out against it. After the Whitebeard Pirates left Wano two weeks later, the retainers discovered Oden,
Izou
, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi to be missing.
During Oden's absence, Kanjuro and his fellow retainers protected Kuri in preparation for Oden's return. When Oden returned to Wano with the
Roger Pirates
, the retainers greeted him, but before they could say anymore,
Kouzuki Toki
stopped them from convincing Oden to stay in Wano. Oden chose to continue his journey with Roger, making Kanjuro angry.
Around six months before Oden finished his voyage, the retainers were furious at Orochi for abusing his position as shogun. While Inuarashi and Kawamatsu stayed behind at Oden Castle, the other retainers marched to the Flower Capital to confront Orochi only to discover that a group of
Beasts Pirates
were in Kuri threatening Oden's family. When Oden returned to Wano after finishing his journey, the retainers (except Denjiro and
Ashura Doji
, who were elsewhere at the time) welcomed him back and told him about Wano's situation. Oden then ordered his retainers to protect his family and Kuri before charging to the capital by himself.
After Oden failed to kill Orochi, Kanjuro and the other retainers remained loyal to him for the next five years despite Oden acting like a fool and losing the respect of most of Wano's people. 20 years ago, Oden finally had enough and decided to take down
Kaidou
. The retainers eagerly followed him and marched with him to
Onigashima
.
On the way to Onigashima, the group was confronted by Kaidou and his crew in the
Udon
region, due to Kanjuro having leaked the informatiom.
Shinobu
joined the samurai and in the ensuing battle, Kanjuro and Denjiro fought
Queen
. Unfortunately, the samurai were overwhelmed in the end. Oden and the Scabbards were then imprisoned in the Flower Capital and sentenced to be boiled alive in three days.
All ten prisoners were later brought to the execution site, at which point Oden made a deal with Kaidou. After Oden stepped into the pot of boiling oil, the retainers were about to join him, but Oden grabbed a plank and ordered them to stand on it as he held them over the pot.
As Oden endured
the hour
, he explained to his retainers the reason Wano Country was isolated and requested them to open Wano's borders for him. Oden successfully survived the hour, but Orochi summoned a firing squad to execute Oden and his retainers. Oden once again told his retainers to open Wano's borders before throwing them far away from the pot. The Scabbards fled with tears as Oden met his demise.
As they were chased by an army of pursuers, Shinobu gave the Scabbards their weapons. On the way back to Oden Castle, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi were captured by the shogun's forces and Denjiro and Ashura split from the group to fight their enemies. By the time the rest of the group reached Oden Castle, it was set ablaze by Kaidou. The retainers went inside the castle and found
Momonosuke
as well as
his sister
and mother. Toki then sent Momonosuke, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, and
Kikunojo
twenty years into the future
.
After arriving at the future, they went around Wano and discovered how much it had changed over the years. However, they discovered allies they could still count on and began forming a plan to take back Wano. Momonosuke, Kanjuro, Kin'emon, and Raizo decided to travel to
Zou
to seek aid from the
Mink Tribe
, but when they were leaving Wano, they were spotted by the Beasts Pirates;
Kanjuro also informed Orochi that they were still around.
Kanjuro sacrificing himself to help Kin'emon escape from Dressrosa.
On the way to Zou, they ended up shipwrecked, in which they got separated from Raizo, and drifted ashore to
Dressrosa
. Once there, they were chased by Dressrosa's guards. Kanjuro chose to be apprehended to cover Kin'emon, allowing him to escape and pursue Momonosuke on a ship that was headed toward
Punk Hazard
.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
After his capture, Kanjuro was imprisoned at the
SMILE Factory
under the guise of a toy house.
While Kin'emon was at the royal palace, Kanjuro was said to have disappeared from the scrapheap.
When Kin'emon later arrived at the scrapheap, it was shown that Kanjuro was hiding in the walls; he was also able to sustain himself by using his Devil Fruit powers to make food. Kin'emon was happy to have found Kanjuro, who was also glad to see Kin'emon again. Kanjuro and Kin'emon prepared to leave on a bird Kanjuro drew and brought to life using his Devil Fruit ability, but the trapped citizens and Dressrosa soldiers begged to be taken along.
Kanjuro helps the prisoners escape from the underground scrapheap.
Kanjuro then used his ability to create ladders for the people to climb to the surface with.
After leaving the scrap heap, Kanjuro and Kin'emon went to the old King's Plateau and met up with
Usopp
,
Viola
, and
Riku Doldo III
. Kanjuro painted a net to keep the citizens from reaching the top, but they ended up climbing it. Kanjuro offered to commit
harakiri
, but Kin'emon told him not to and Usopp beat them both with Kanjuro's brush.
Upon Usopp's request, Kanjuro created a doodle drawn by the sniper which was then converted into a special projectile that Usopp would use to defeat
Sugar
. When the Dressrosa citizens reached the top of the plateau, Kanjuro and others held them back long enough for Usopp to snipe at Sugar. Though Kanjuro and Kin'emon were tied up, Usopp was successful in making Sugar lose consciousness.
The Dressrosa citizens then released the samurai and the others, realizing that they were merely playing into
Donquixote Doflamingo
's hands if they had continued. They were later joined by
Issho
, who decided to place his faith in
Monkey D. Luffy
and his allies.
After most of the
Donquixote Pirates
' officers were defeated, Kanjuro informed Usopp that Issho left and went to the city. Kanjuro, Kin'emon, and Usopp then saw
Pica
heading towards the old King's Plateau.
When Pica prepared to crush everyone on the plateau, Kanjuro was awestruck when
Roronoa Zoro
destroyed the Pica statue and defeated Pica.
As Doldo,
Tank Lepanto
, and the citizens were leaving the old King's Plateau, Kanjuro heard about
Trafalgar Law
's defeat from Viola.
Kanjuro, Zoro, and Kin'emon help stop the Birdcage.
Later, as Doflamingo's
Birdcage
started shrinking he left the old King's Plateau with Kin'emon and Zoro. Kanjuro was informed by Zoro about his intention to stop the Birdcage.
Once they reached the Birdcage, Kanjuro and Kin'emon were surprised that Zoro made an attempt to push back the Birdcage. The samurais tried to tell Zoro that it would be impossible, but Zoro angrily told them to help instead of doing nothing.
The two samurai complied and they were soon aided by Issho. With everyone pushing, the cage stopped for a moment.
They kept pushing the Birdcage back just long enough for Luffy to deal one decisive blow to Doflamingo. Once Doflamingo had been defeated, they witnessed the collapse of the Birdcage. They rejoiced as Doflamingo's downfall was announced to Dressrosa.
Three days after Doflamingo's downfall, Kin'emon and Kanjuro traveled through the central streets, watching the citizens rebuild the country. They later appeared at
Kyros
' house, eating a meal with the
Straw Hat Pirates
. They prepared to leave when the
Marines
were mobilized to pursue Luffy and all those affiliated with him. They fled when the Marines were about to storm Kyros' house.
After Luffy separated from the group to take care of unfinished business, Kanjuro's group went to the eastern port. While waiting for Luffy, they saw Issho approaching.
When Issho prepared to attack them with all the rubble from Dressrosa, they quickly fled to the escape ship. At that moment, Luffy arrived and attacked Issho.
During the clash, Issho used
his gravity ability
to blow away Luffy, who was then caught by
Hajrudin
. They quickly fled across a bridge leading to a gigantic ship in the distance. Issho prepared to drop the rubble on them but was obstructed by the Dressrosa citizens who were pretending to chase after the pirates. They eventually reached
Orlumbus
' flagship, the
Yonta Maria
.
After the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
was formed, they held a feast to celebrate their victory over Doflamingo.
After the feast, each of the leading allies received a piece of Luffy's
Vivre Card
and parted ways.
Bartolomeo
then brought the Straw Hats, the samurais, and Law to his ship, the
Going Luffy-senpai
.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[

Zou Arc
[
]
During a hail storm, Luffy's group learned that the
Barto Club
does not have a navigator, lacks experience in sailing, and usually call
Gambia
's grandmother who gives them useless advice. Therefore, the Straw Hats, the samurais, and Law needed to protect the ship. After one week of traversing through the dangers of the
New World
, the ship finally arrived at Zou. Kanjuro commented that he heard tales of a tribe that hates humans.
After finding the Thousand Sunny, the Barto Club bid Luffy's group farewell. Proceeding to search for
Sanji
's group, they climbed the
giant elephant
's left hind leg with a dragon that Kanjuro conjured. After the samurais explained that they were also searching for their ninja comrade, Raizo, the group saw something dropping towards them.
Kanjuro, Kin'emon, and Bariete ride Nekozaemon up Zou's leg.
The thing that was falling towards them happened to be
a monkey
. While Kin'emon and Kanjuro were fooling around, the monkey hit them, causing them to fall off the dragon. Despite being separated from the group, the samurais assured the Straw Hats that they were alright and will catch up to them eventually.
Kanjuro later conjured a cat, which he, Kin'emon, and the monkey used to climb the elephant's leg. As they saw the eruption rain, they panicked as the cat would melt if it made contact with water.
Having failed to reach Zou, Kin'emon and Kanjuro returned to the
Thousand Sunny
and decided to wait until the next day.
On the next morning, they finally reached Zou. When Kin'emon asked the monkey mink about Raizo, he quickly ran away. The samurais chased after him, not noticing a sleeping
Franky
,
Nico Robin
, and
Brook
.
Kanjuro and Kin'emon reunite with Inuarashi and Nekomamushi.
On the way to the Mokomo Dukedom, Kanjuro and Kin'emon reunited with Momonosuke. When they arrived at Kurau City, they were quickly intercepted by the Straw Hats, who tried desperately to keep them hidden. However, when they saw
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
fighting with each other, the samurais revealed themselves, much to the Straw Hats' horror. Contrary to what the Straw Hats expected, the
Mink Tribe
welcomed them and revealed that Raizo is safe as well as having a friendship with Kin'emon's clan.
After Inuarashi and Nekomamushi called a truce for the sake of Momonosuke, whom they recognized as their lord, they took the samurais and the Straw Hats to a secret area in the Whale Forest where Raizo was hidden.
After making their reacquaintance, Kanjuro, Kin'emon, and Raizo were saddened to see the state Zou was in after
Jack
's invasion. They then went back inside the whale tree once Robin finished deciphering the
red poneglyph
hidden there. After explaining the history of the
Kouzuki Family
and their connection to the poneglyphs, the samurais and Raizo expressed sorrow in explaining Lord Oden's execution at the hands of Kaidou and the shogun of Wano Country
Kurozumi Orochi
.
The samurais and the two rulers of Zou revealed Oden's will to open the country of Wano to the world and to defeat Kaidou and the shogun of Wano Country. The samurais also explained that they needed allies which was the reason why they journeyed to Zou. They then formed
an alliance with the Mink Tribe and the Straw Hats
.
They later left the secret room and the samurais explained that they never went with Oden during his travels as leaving the borders of Wano is a crime. While discussing their plans to defeat Kaidou, the alliance decided to split up and meet up again at Wano Country. Law agreed to take the samurais back to Wano Country in
his submarine
. Right after they left the Whale Tree, they felt Zou shaking and heard Zunesha crying.
Zou's shaking was because of Jack returning and assaulting the giant elephant, which Kanjuro had led him to.
On Momonosuke's command, Zunesha retaliated and sank Jack's fleet. With the threat of Jack ended, everyone became calm again.
After Momonosuke decided to stay on Zou in order to communicate more with Zunesha, Kanjuro and his comrades prepared to go back to Wano with Law and Zoro accompanying them. As the Sanji Retrieval Team departed from Zou, everyone, except for the Straw Hat members left behind, was shocked when Luffy jumped off Zunesha with his party.
Wano Country Saga

Kanjuro and his group later infiltrated Wano Country, where they remained hidden until the alliance was ready to strike.
While incognito, Kanjuro worked as a fishmonger. After Franky left his job, he informed Kanjuro of the bad news concerning the blueprints of Kaidou's fortress.
After the chaos at Orochi's palace, Kanjuro rendezvoused with Shinobu, Robin,
Nami
, and Brook at the Northern Graveyard in the
Ringo
region. During their meeting, Kanjuro was surprised at the large amount of information Robin was able to gather.
Sometime later, the Beasts Pirates found out about Kin'emon's secret message and the moon marks on the ankles of the Kouzuki Family supporters. At Ebisu Town, Shinobu got into a heated argument with Law, suspecting that Law's captured crewmates revealed the meaning of Kin'emon's secret message. When Shinobu said that the captives should be disposed of, Kanjuro disagreed with her, saying that it was most important that they retain the allies they had made, as otherwise they would be unable to bring down Orochi and Kaidou.
Tonoyasu
then entered the house and recognized Shinobu and Kanjuro, much to their surprise. He then showed them a copy of the message and talked about the rumors swirling around the Flower Capital, wondering if the final battle was at hand.
After telling Kanjuro and Shinobu that he would join them, Tonoyasu left the house. Kanjuro and Shinobu then explained to Sanji, Franky, and Robin that they did not actually know who Tonoyasu was, making them questioned on how he knew them.
The witnessing members of the Nine Red Scabbards mourn Yasuie's death.
When news of Tonoyasu's capture was revealed, Kanjuro and his group gathered to see him being shown on a broadcast. He finally recognized him as Yasuie, a former daimyo who supported Oden.
Kanjuro and his group rushed to Rasetsu Town but only arrived after Yasuie was shot and executed. As he seemingly mourned Yasuie's death, Kanjuro regretted not recognizing him sooner and called his death a grave mistake.
Kanjuro's group managed to retrieve Yasuie's body and returned to Ebisu Town. Kanjuro then promised the villagers that he would give Yasuie a burial in Kuri.
He later joined a meeting with several key alliance members at Amigasa Village.
Following this meeting, he reported to Orochi that the alliance's new meeting place was Tokage Port, that Oden's daughter
Kouzuki Hiyori
was still alive, and the location of the Straw Hats' ship.
On the day for the raid on Onigashima, Kanjuro marched to the rebel meeting place with Momonosuke, Kin'emon, Kikunojo, Raizo, Shinobu, Inuarashi, Kawamatsu, and Ashura.
The group eventually arrived at the meeting place, but found none of their ships and allies.
In spite of this major setback, the Scabbards were still determined to go through with the raid, knowing that they would not get another chance.
Kanjuro stayed behind on the coast in secret, sending a drawing clone onto the boat with the other retainers. As Kin'emon wondered about the possibility of a traitor among them, Kanjuro's clone then revealed that he was the traitor. The clone questioned why none of them had seriously suspected a traitor despite many of their maneuvers becoming compromised, and Kin'emon beheaded it, only for Kanjuro to reveal that his real body was on the coast and that he had captured Momonosuke and tied up Shinobu. As this was happening, the Scabbards' boat was confronted by three Beasts Pirates ships, but the ships were suddenly attacked by the Straw Hats,
Heart Pirates
, and
Kid Pirates
, leaving Kanjuro surprised as he had not heard of this.
Kanjuro abducting Momonosuke.
Kanjuro was then surprised when Denjiro arrived and revealed himself. He was further shocked when Denjiro explained that the rebels gathered at the wharf of Habu instead of Tokage Port. Kanjuro became furious at Kin'emon when Denjiro assumed that he said the wrong port to mislead the spy.
Considering that he had fulfilled his duty, Kanjuro then drew a crane on the ground and prepared to leave the scene with Momonosuke in tow. However,
Kawamatsu
swam back to the coast and attempted to stand in his way, resulting in a few blows between the two. Nevertheless, Kanjuro conjured the crane and escaped on its back, claiming that he would find Hiyori and dispose of her. As the Straw Hats determined to hinder him, he used his
Ukiyo Yudachi Ezu
technique in order to cause disarray among the alliance. He then mocked Oden and Toki's legacy as well as Momonosuke's cowardice before flying away to Onigashima.
Kanjuro defeated by his former comrades.
After arriving at the island, Kanjuro got lost due to the island's complex layout and he had to strike down some Beasts Pirates who still thought he was an enemy.
At some point, Momonosuke attempted to escape and cut Kanjuro's hand in the process. In response, Kanjuro brutally beat the boy to the point of unconsciousness. He eventually reached Orochi and Kaidou and delivered Momonosuke to them, also informing them that the plot to stop the Kouzuki revolution had failed.
Kanjuro then went and confronted his former comrades with an army at Onigashima's back entrance. After mocking them and explaining Momonosuke's escape attempt and how his execution was taking place, Kanjuro clashed with Kikunojo.
He was then defeated and left bleeding on the ground, and Kin'emon solemnly dropped his hat upon him in passing.
Kanjuro survived the duel, but sustained grievous wounds that he knew would not give him much longer to live. Still intent on eradicating the Kouzuki Clan,
Kanjuro drew a perfect replica of Oden and sent it to trick and ambush the other Scabbards.
Nearly all of them were fooled by the ruse, but Ashura Doji saw through it and attacked the Oden drawing, leading it to stab him before lighting
explosives
under its garment to take out all of Kanjuro's former comrades. Ashura managed to save the other Scabbards by forcing the Oden drawing out of the room and sacrificing himself in its large explosion, and Kanjuro cackled in satisfaction, calling his Oden trick the perfect finale to his "performance". Whilst commandeering the Oden drawing, Kanjuro also ran through the halls of Kaidou's fortress in search of Momonosuke.
Kanjuro is struck down by Kin'emon.
Kanjuro arrived at the first floor crawlspace, where Momonosuke was with Shinobu, Kin'emon, and Kikunojo. Before entering, he shrouded himself in another Oden disguise in an attempt to pose as his old master again. Kikunojo was angered by this and charged at Kanjuro, but he maintained his act throughout, and ultimately caused Kiku to hesitate when he mentioned how Oden took in her and Izou as children. This allowed Kanjuro to pierce through Kiku's chest with his sword, and his Oden disguise then dissipated as he laughed triumphantly at having repaid her for the fatal wound she had given him. As Kin'emon caught Kiku and talked with her, Kanjuro readied his paintbrush to strike him, but Kin'emon then unsheathed his sword and struck Kanjuro down with a deep diagonal cut to the chest. As he fell to the ground with mortal wounds, Kanjuro laughed and noted how fitting it was that the man who had been his closest "onstage" comrade had been the one to strike him down.
Kanjuro's final act: Kazenbo.
Despite having been fatally wounded, Kanjuro remained alive when he received a message from Orochi. Coaxing Kanjuro to give one final performance for his ancestors and fulfill their revenge against those who wronged them, Orochi commanded him to create one final painting and send it into the basement, saying it was their family's burial crypt (it was actually the Onigashima's secret armory, which was filled with enough explosives to destroy the whole island). With that, Kanjuro used the last of his strength to paint a fiery specter called "
Kazenbo
", which slowly moved through the castle and burned everybody and everything it touched along the way. Once that was done, Kanjuro collapsed dead.
Post-Mortem
[

After Kanjuro's death, Kazenbo continued its fiery path towards the armory, setting the whole mansion ablaze and threatening everyone within it. Just when it reached its destination, however, Yamato was able to intercept it by freezing the explosives and striking it with ice-infused attacks.
When Big Mom appeared while being forced out of Onigashima by Kid and Law, she detonated one of the bombs, thus causing an explosion that nearly destroyed Kazenbo's form, reducing it to a mere wisp.
Kazenbo then found Orochi trapped under debris next to Hiyori. Orochi believed that it was Kanjuro still alive inside Kazenbo and ordered him to burn Hiyori alive, but instead, it went towards the fallen shogun himself, setting him on fire.
While on the verge of burning to death, Orochi transformed and prepared to kill Hiyori out of spite, only to be decapitated by Denjiro at the last second. The fire that Kazenbo helped spread was then put out by both Jinbe and Raizo, thus finally bringing the Kurozumi Family's reign of terror to an end.
