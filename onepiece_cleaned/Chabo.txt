Personality
[
]
After
Arlong
killed his father, Chabo wanted to kill the
fish-man
himself in order to avenge his father's death.
After Chabo mistook Usopp for Arlong, Nojiko made Chabo realize that throwing his life away for revenge was not worth it as there were still people who cared for him in this world.
While he seemed aggressive for wanting to take revenge, in reality, he was very upset by his father's sudden death and was unable to process it in a healthy way until Nojiko spoke to him.
After the timeskip, Chabo seems happier, now working for Nojiko.

stopped him outside the gate and told him to leave. When he did not listen, she struck him down and left him a large sum of money to make him leave.

Usopp
in the ruins of Gosa Village and tripped him, thinking that Usopp was a
fish-man
due to Usopp's long nose. Before he could stab Usopp,

hit him on the head and stopped him. After returning to Nojiko's home, she asked him about the attack on Gosa Village and told him not to throw his life away. She asked if he has a mother, to which he answered, "Yes." He was then sent on his way to her because she was most likely worried about him.
