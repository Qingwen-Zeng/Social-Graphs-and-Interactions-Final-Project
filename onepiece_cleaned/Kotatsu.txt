History

Making their Mark
[
]
Kotatsu was a freak show animal who was captured by poachers. Ace freed him from the poacher's trap, and Kotatsu joined the Spade Pirates to travel with Ace as he made a name for himself. He helped fight off a group of bounty hunters, and, when
Isuka
infiltrated the crew's ship, he surrounded the
Marine
Ensign alongside his crewmates. However, she easily fended them off. After the confrontation, the crew reached
Sabaody Archipelago
. While they waited for their ship to be
coated
, Kotatsu and his crewmates explored the island and secretly read Deuce's adventure diary. Unlike the rest of his crewmates, he did not laugh at his poor writing skills.
After spending time in Sabaody, Kotatsu and the Spade Pirates descended to
Fish-Man Island
to begin their journey in the
New World
.
At one point, the Spade Pirates were shipwrecked in
Wano Country
. The people from Amigasa Village were starving to death, so they tied the entire crew and stole all their food. The crew watched the villagers finish their meal and then broke out. Instead of attacking, Ace asked the villagers where he could get them dessert. They stayed in Amigasa Village for a few weeks and became good friends with
Tama
. They also went to Onigashima to liberate the abducted children from the Beasts Pirates. They never encountered Kaidou and his top subordinates because they were away on an expedition. After Ace did so much damage to Kaidou's castle, they rescued the children and met Yamato, whom Ace had a brief scuffle with.
Encountering Whitebeard

The Spade Pirates prepare to fight Whitebeard.
After Ace and
Jinbe
tied, Kotatsu and the other Spade Pirates defended their captain against
Edward Newgate
and were easily defeated. They were then taken into the
Whitebeard Pirates
like their captain.
Kotatsu has not been seen since his joining.
