In the manga, Yazaemon was not shown attacking Robin when the Oniwabanshu confronted her, but in the anime he appeared to attempt to bind her.
In the manga, Yazaemon did not appear with the Orochi Oniwabanshu after
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution but in the anime, Yazaemon is shown with the Orochi Oniwabanshu to help fight off the
Straw Hat Pirates
at the execution site. He along with the other members is also shown terrified by
Brook
's disembodied spirit and mistook him for the
Gashadokuro
