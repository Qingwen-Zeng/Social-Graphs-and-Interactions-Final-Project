What led to Rob Lucci's dismissal from CP9?
The defeat of Rob Lucci at the hands of Luffy led to his dismissal from CP9. His loss marked the end of his five-year mission and caused upheaval within Cipher Pol, prompting a reorganization of agents. Lucci, now a fugitive, was pursued by Spandam and Cipher Pol members until he joined CP0.

How did Rob Lucci obtain the Pluton blueprints?
Rob Lucci never obtained the true Pluton blueprints. These blueprints, passed down by shipwrights of Water 7, were for Pluton, a powerful ancient battleship, and kept as a contingency if Pluton was ever misused and a counter-weapon was required. Lucci secured a shipwright position at the Galley-La Company in Water 7, with the objective of obtaining the blueprints. Iceburg tricked Lucci with fake blueprints, and Franky destroyed the real blueprints.

Appearance
[
]
Lucci is a tall and slim, yet muscular man with arched eyebrows and a close-shaved goatee. He has shoulder length wavy black hair that is sometimes tied in a ponytail. When he is not fighting, his pet pigeon
Hattori
is usually perched quietly on his right shoulder. He has a tattoo of a crossed-out square on each upper arm,
as well as five cannonball scars on his back in the shape of the World Government symbol.
He was noted to be good looking by some women from Water 7 and Gatherine.
He wore a large black top hat with a sepia band until he lost it during his fight with Luffy.
As a shipwright, he wore brown trousers with caramel suspenders over a white tank-top
and shoes with black toecaps.
As an assassin, he wore a two-piece black suit with the sleeves normally rolled up, complete with black leather shoes and a white tie and handkerchief in the breast pocket.
When invading
Iceburg's mansion
he was wearing a bull mask and a light pink robe with thick sleeves and a yellow "tie" above.
In
SBS Volume 44
, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Lucci is shown with the kanji for "peace"
(
平和
,
heiwa
?
)
on his shirt, which possibly suggests that the branch Lucci is holding is an olive branch in tribute to the type of branch held by white doves (in this case Hattori) as a sign of peace.
The anime had also portrayed Lucci as a teenager in its rendition of his past story. Though the two portrayals of Lucci are meant to be him, they have different styles to them, mostly because Oda's version was drawn after the anime had already depicted him and not just because they show him at two different ages. Note that Oda did depict the silhouette of thirteen-year-old Lucci from the backside, though only briefly - this most likely is where the anime design for him originates.
In
CP9's Independent Report
, he wore a light spotted shirt with a black coat over his shoulders and had bandages over his forehead and chest from his fight with Luffy and let his hair fall freely.
After the timeskip, he wears a blue-white suit with a white coat draped over his shoulders. His beard has also grown longer and has a small ball on the end. As a
CP0
agent, he wears a simple mask that covers the top half of his face, with markings that curve beneath the eyes.
In
One Piece Film: Gold
, he wears a little medal on the chest, during the
Levely Arc
, he instead wears a purple flower. During the
Egghead Arc
, he wears a medal with a slightly different design.

Personality
[
]
Lucci's usual cold look.
Lucci comes off as a cold, distant, and collected
Cipher Pol
agent; almost completely psychopathic and amoral of everything around him. A testament to his cold-blooded nature is his brutal assault on his "friend" of five years, Paulie, whom he even tried to kill after the CP9's identities were revealed.
He also stated that he felt no true bond with the city of
Water 7
which he lived in for five years,
and had no concern for his superior
Spandam
, though he is widely regarded amongst his CP9 colleagues despite his arrogance.
During his long undercover period, Lucci remained silent all the time, using
Hattori
as his preferred method of communication. In spite of his unfriendly looks, shipwright Lucci was polite, humble and tended to call out his fellow shipwrights for questionable conduct, particularly
Paulie
. Once his mission was completed, Lucci completely abandoned this persona, reverting back to the cold killer attitude that is natural to CP9's agents.
Lucci bases his outlook of
justice
on his personal philosophy that any person or thing that goes against the World Government's interests should be destroyed, but is also evil for being that way. Specifically, he has declared to enforce
Absolute Justice
in CP9’s form of "Dark Justice"
(
闇の正義
,
Yami no Seigi
?
)
,
his motto being "Necessary Evil"
(
必要悪
,
Hitsuyō Aku
?
)
.
As such, he is willing go to extreme lengths to fulfill his given mission by any means necessary, believing that CP9's authority to kill to be justified.
Lucci also finds it offensive when someone shows weakness around him
, going as far as to dismiss a
new colleague
by presumably killing him for being weak.
The reason that he killed the five hundred soldiers in his past was due to another belief of his - the belief that weakness is a sin. Personally, he believes anyone who shows weakness is no better than a criminal.
However, it appears that in spite of his stoic and professional appearance, Lucci is far from emotionless or beyond provocation. Beneath his expressionless demeanor, lies tremendous pride and arrogance along with extreme bloodthirst. In the Tower of Justice at Enies Lobby, he revealed that he only joined the World Government so he could be legally allowed to kill people; a sentiment which dates back to his childhood. An example of Lucci's lust for violence is when he compromised the mission of bringing
Robin
to the
Gates of Justice
, by allowing Monkey D. Luffy to tail him for the sole purpose of having a battle, smirking when Luffy burst through the door.
In and out of combat, Lucci is very sadistic and also seems to derive amusement and gratification from inflicting physical and emotional pain on others. These scenes, along with his anticipation of battle, are the only times where he feels genuinely happy.
As an example of his sadism, Lucci once flooded an entire passageway in an attempt to kill the Straw Hat crew members moving through it, simply because he wanted to eliminate Luffy's chances of having everything, just to anger him.
Lucci has a habit of demoralizing and taunting his opponents, which is seen various times during his confrontation with Luffy, where he constantly brought up the possibility of killing Nico Robin.
Lastly, while understated initially, it is very clear Lucci's title of the strongest in CP9's history has massively elevated his ego, leading to what appears to be a superiority complex. This pride also means he has a very low tolerance for insults. During his fight with Luffy, Lucci did not pay attention to Usopp until he started insulting him. In addition, he reacts rather violently to anyone calling him a
gaki
(slang in Japanese for "kid" or "brat"), responding with a kick and a retort both times after
Iceburg
and
Franky
referred to him as such.
This is perhaps best exemplified by his reencounter with Luffy at Egghead, where Lucci was eager to fight him again while disregarding Kaku and Stussy's warnings that they needed permission from the World Government to do so due to Luffy's new
status
. Aside from Lucci's own personal vendetta towards Luffy for defeating him two years ago, Lucci cannot accept the fact that a "mere pirate" was able to defeat CP9's strongest and ignored all warnings and protocols just so he could battle Luffy one more time. Sometimes, Lucci's pride borders on unfitting childishness as, despite losing once more, he still stubbornly refused to acknowledge Luffy's power or his stature as an Emperor of the Sea despite the latter's victory against
Kaidou
, although he would later relent and admit his enemy's status as an Emperor.
Lucci showing gratitude to the doctors who saved his life.
Despite all this apparent lack of morality, Lucci has displayed some, if very little, sympathy for those he dubs innocent. When the Candy Pirates were attacking a small village, he quickly dispatched the captain to save the people,
though his demonstration of
Absolute Justice
later prompts him and his comrades to leave.
This shows that deep down, he is not completely heartless and is more honorable to the people he respects. Likewise, he shows concern for his pet pigeon Hattori, sending him away when in dangerous situations. Lastly, he expressed gratitude to the doctor who saved his life after his clash with Luffy on Enies Lobby.
After the timeskip, Lucci's personality has largely stayed the same, as he condoned Saint Charlos' attempts to claim Shirahoshi as a slave during the Levely. He maintains that the Celestial Dragons are divine and have the right to obtain what they want from normal humans.
Still, he is one of the few government agents that is willing to question and delve into the ongoings of the institution, regardless of the dangers of doing so.
Lucci also appears to be very honest when he is not under orders to maintain his cover. Even when his enemies had him in cuffs and his only hope of survival was to convince them to release him, he still answered all their questions truthfully without hesitation, even though his answers would have made them want to free him less.
That said, this all turned out to be deception from his part, showing that Lucci can be patient and pragmatic in extremely unfavorable situations.
Relationships
[
]
Organizations
[
]
CP9
[
]
Lucci saved by Blueno.
With the exception of
Spandam
, Lucci has known his fellow CP9 colleagues since growing up together during childhood, though he rarely expressed any concern for them beyond his usual arrogance and superiority. Despite Lucci's cold reputation as a mass murderer, the core members of CP9 (excluding Spandam) genuinely care for Lucci's well-being, evidenced in their efforts to raise money to help pay for an operation that Lucci needed to save his life and their celebration when he was discharged from the hospital. He also had a fierce rivalry with
Jabra
that was most evidently expressed by their opposing Zoan fruit forms.
Lucci did not care for CP9's newest agent,
Nero
, stating that his defeat was expected due to his inability to use the whole Rokushiki moveset. As such, Lucci decided to kill him after his defeat by Franky by stabbing Nero multiple times in the back with
Shigan
and throwing him into the ocean.
Kaku
[
]
Lucci has a generally good relationship with his fellow assassin Kaku, considering him his partner. They both spent 5 years under disguise as Galley-La employees and were among the most competent and reasonable of the shipwrights working there. Kaku respects Lucci's strength and often obeys and follows his orders, as if the latter was his superior. Lucci overall cares about Kaku's well-being and even requested
Marcus Mars
to spare his friend, who was badly injury and trapped, at one point.
As members of CP0, their relationship more or less remains the same, with Kaku's more excitable personality generally contrasting with Lucci's aloofness. That said, Kaku is sometimes annoyed by Lucci's audacity in not following proper protocols and questioning the government. Kaku in particular was baffled at Lucci's outright honesty about declaring his intentions to kill all the Straw Hats, when they were both trying to convince Luffy and
Zoro
to release them from
seastone
handcuffs in the first place.
Jabra
[
]
Shadowy silhouettes of Lucci and Jabra expressing their rivalry in their most feral form.
Lucci and Jabra appear to have a fierce rivalry, owning to their opposing Zoan themes of a feline and a canine respectively. During their first reunion at
Enies Lobby
after 5 years, both agents quickly devolved into petty mockery and calling the other names, forcing the other CP9 members to talk some sense to them when hostilities became too intense.
Despite their rivalry, Jabra still seems to care about Lucci's well being, raising money to help pay for an operation that Lucci needed to save his life.
Spandam
[
]
Lucci working with Spandam.
Even though he highly disregards Spandam as a weakling, Lucci still acknowledged him as his boss without question.
However, he did appear to harbor some disdain for Spandam, having flippantly referred to his boss as "a certain idiot" and wishing he could witness Luffy's excellent initiative as a leader.
Spandam also believed in Lucci's strength, and he always referred to him as the strongest agent of Cipher Pol 9's history.
Their dynamic would change after the destruction of Enies Lobby, where Spandam and his father
Spandine
had Lucci and his fellow former subordinates framed as scapegoats to cover his own mishap. Likewise, Lucci vowed to Spandam and his father that they would return one day to find them.
After thwarting a treacherous operation orchestrated by Spandine,
Lucci was reinstated to the World Government alongside Spandam as members of CP0 with their roles reversed, with the latter now having to serve his former henchman as his superior.
World Government
[
]
Lucci ready to fight alongside the rest of CP9 in the World Government's turf.
As the strongest Cipher Pol agent in CP9, the World Government saw Lucci as a very important asset to their cause and his strength is acknowledged by the
Marines
and even the
Warlords
. Lucci was willing to do whatever it takes for their sake and followed the doctrine of Absolute Justice; he believed that the 500 soldiers who surrendered to pirates were no different than criminals who deserved death, and the Government apparently did not argue with his unauthorized killing of them. However, after Spandam framed CP9 for his debacles, Lucci and his colleagues briefly became fugitives of the World Government.
As of the time skip, however, this seems to have been rectified after the former agents successfully stopped a plot lead by Spandine from committing an unsanctioned
act of aggression
alongside former Level 6 prisoners of
Impel Down
and certain parties of the
Underworld
.
For his service, Lucci has been reinstated and promoted to CP0, and Spandam has since been demoted from his former position as CP0 Chief into his current subordinate role.
While Lucci is loyal to the World Government, he also calls to question with some of their decision-making; namely their order to eliminate the world-famous scientist
Vegapunk
. During the
Egghead Arc
, Lucci's constant desire to fight Luffy for revenge after the Enies Lobby incident caused him to ignore the usual protocols from the World Government that prohibited fights with the
Four Emperors
, showing that while Lucci will loyally carry out any given mission, he either does not care or is not afraid to disregard certain rules of conduct to do so.
Ultimately, despite Lucci's loyalty and status,
Jaygarcia Saturn
of the
Five Elders
deemed him expendable regarding the situation at Egghead, prioritizing the safety of York,
Punk Records
, and the power plant needed to produce the
Mother Flame
, over one of their best agents.
Marcus Mars
of the Elders also brushed off Lucci's request to spare Kaku as difficult.
Marines
[
]
Despite working for the World Government, Lucci is indifferent towards the
Marines
and shows no hesitation to sacrifice their men to reach his goals. That being said, many marines like Vice-Admiral
Onigumo
and Admiral
Borsalino
hold Lucci's strength and competency in high esteem, considering him a valuable asset.
World Nobles
[
]
As an agent of CP0, Lucci has absolute loyalty to the World Nobles, regardless of their immense tyranny, believing that their status as gods privileges them to do whatever they want, even if it means enslaving a princess or assassinating a king. Thus, while Lucci dutifully obeyed Charlos' orders to enslave Shirahoshi and also to execute Neptune for his defiance, he did not interfere when Mjosgard, another World Noble, punished Charlos for his atrocity. In
One Piece Film: Gold
,
however, the completion of a mission is more important to him than the well-being of the Celestial Dragons, as he completely disregarded the safety of
Camael
and his noble companion and was more than willing to lose them to collateral damage if it meant accomplishing his goal.
Enemies
[
]
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Among the
Straw Hat Pirates
, there are two particular people that Lucci once targeted for mission purposes:
Nico Robin
and
Franky
, the first for her knowledge of the
Poneglyphs
and the latter for being suspected of having the blueprints of
Pluton
. While Robin was already a long-time target of the organization, Franky only caught Lucci's eye after he figured out the shipwright's true identity as Cutty Flam.
While disguised as an employee of Galley-La, Lucci was professional and helpful towards the Straw Hats, explaining to them about the issues of repairing the
Going Merry
. After revealing himself as a government agent, however, Lucci became hostile towards the group. That said, he honored the deal he made with Robin beforehand to spare the Straw Hat crew and leave them alone as long as she renounced membership and cooperated with their mission. This deal fell through when the Straw Hats insisted in pursuing Lucci and CP9 to
Enies Lobby
, at which point he considered them valid targets for killing.
The members of the Straw Hat Pirates are all aware of how powerful and dangerous Lucci is. They acknowledged that if Luffy did not hold him off at Enies Lobby, many of them would have been killed by the assassin. Even after two years and having grown much stronger, the Weakling Trio remain terrified of Lucci and wanted to avoid being on the same island as him, despite not being his current target.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Lucci and Luffy locked in combat.
Lucci personally made an enemy out of the Straw Hats'
captain
, Luffy. The two engaged in a vicious battle at the tower of Enies Lobby. Lucci was an extremely formidable opponent and made Luffy exert himself through raw physical power more than ever before, to the point where Luffy was unable to move after the battle. Despite being enemies, Lucci ultimately respected Luffy's strength and determination, saying that it would have been boring for him to have died in the Buster Call bombardment, and also added that Luffy is a worthy captain for having absolute faith in his crew and their ability to survive.
Lucci and Luffy face off again on Egghead in their awakened states.
Lucci would later re-encounter Luffy during the
Egghead Arc
as
CP0
's attack against Dr.
Vegapunk
began.
In spite of being fully aware of Luffy's status as one of the Four Emperors, Lucci chose to disregard the World Government's protocol, which prevented confronting an Emperor without clearance, due to the events of Enies Lobby two years ago. The agent then revealed his new awakened form, teasing Luffy about being not the only one to have gotten stronger and immediately clashed with Straw Hat in his awakened state as well, continuing to ignore any protocols for the chance to avenge his prior defeat. Despite being ordered not to attack the Straw Hat Pirates on Egghead until the Marines arrived, Lucci continued to not listen, admitting he did not acknowledge Luffy as an Emperor.
Later on, when the
Seraphim
were ordered to kill both the captive CP0 and the Straw Hats, Lucci and Kaku had no choice but to ask to be freed and then team up with Luffy and
Zoro
to survive,
with Lucci rather boldly admitting he would never attack the other members of the Straw Hat Pirates or the
SSG
before he eliminated Luffy first.
Still, Lucci would later go back on his word and attempt to assassinate Dr. Vegapunk once more.
When he starts fighting Zoro, he calls him the No. 2 of an Emperor, indicating that he has now come to acknowledge Luffy's title.
Luffy always refers to Lucci as "Pigeon Guy"
(
ハトの奴
,
Hato no Yatsu
?
)
, even after the timeskip. This mostly stems from Luffy being quite impressed by Lucci's ventriloquist act back when the latter was under disguise.
Nico Robin
[
]
Lucci, along with the whole of CP9, was a major enemy of
Nico Robin
. However, Lucci was especially interested in arresting her because of her symbolic existence and threat against the World Government.
As part of a deal he made with Robin, Lucci and the rest of CP9 would leave the Straw Hats alone if she simply left the crew and cooperated with their mission to find the blueprints for Pluton. However, since Robin did not expect the Straw Hats to go to such extremes for her at Enies Lobby, the deal was called off. While fighting Luffy, Lucci would frequently taunt him about Robin and how he would never allow her to live.
During the
Raid on Onigashima
, Lucci, now part of CP0, requested his fellow agents to capture Nico Robin, which ended unsuccessfully.
Franky
[
]
Because of his relation to
Tom
and
Iceburg
and the possibility of being the Pluton blueprint holder, Franky was a person of interest to Lucci. After dealing with Iceburg, Lucci attacked the
Franky Family
, interrogated
Zambai
and invaded Franky's secret warehouse (the former
Tom's Workers
HQ) to search for the blueprints, all of which earned Franky's ire.
Lucci also had Franky arrested for the accident he caused years ago (that
Tom
took responsibility for) as an excuse to bring him to Enies Lobby as well and question him further.
Later, at Enies Lobby, Franky revealed he indeed had the blueprints all along and burned them in front of CP9, much to Lucci's shock, as the action rendered his mission to retrieve them all for naught. Franky, alongside Luffy, also confronted Lucci briefly, who commended on the cyborg's abilities, but turned out to be way below the assassin's league in terms of power.
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
Lucci briefly clashed with
Zoro
when he first revealed his CP9 identity, blocking his strike and throwing him away along with Luffy.
Two years later, upon Marine
Admiral
Kizaru's
arrival to Egghead island, Lucci would shed his façade of an alliance with
Vegapunk
and the
Straw Hat Pirates
(something that Zoro himself was against from the beginning). After incapacitating Stussy during a failed attempt on Vegapunk's life, Lucci engaged Zoro in combat, during which they fought at their maximum strength while Kizaru fought Luffy, with Lucci stating that killing Zoro would be as satisfying as killing Luffy, a feat Zoro claimed would be impossible for Lucci to achieve. During their battle Zoro struck Lucci with a heavy blow leaving him weakened, but before Lucci could attempt anything else Zoro was forced to escape, ending their fight.
Iceburg
[
]
Iceburg
was the holder of the plans to Pluton for four years after Tom's death. After those four years, he secretly gave them to the man who he thought to be dead, Cutty Flam. As this was done in secret, the government still believed that Iceburg was in possession of the plans. As such, he was forever pestered by officials who came to try and convince him to hand over the plans. After years of being stalked by government officers for the Pluton plans, the strongest divisions of the Cipher Pol were secretly sent for Iceburg.
Without him knowing, four of the CP9 agents infiltrated Water 7 and disguised themselves to look like normal people, with several even gaining entries into his trusted inner circle. Three more masked people entered the room and revealed themselves to be not only CP9, but also people that Iceburg trusted: Lucci, Kalifa, Kaku, and bartender Blueno. Lucci revealed his theory about the real Pluton blueprints' whereabouts, while Kaku felt his pulse, and Iceburg's heightened and nervous reactions only confirmed it. Lucci later offered to step on Iceburg's face to prove his antagonism, showing no attachment for his former boss.
Paulie
[
]
During his five years working undercover as a shipwright under Iceburg, Lucci acted as a friend to fellow shipwright
Paulie
. Despite Lucci's actions against Paulie's gambling addiction, the two were seemingly very close. However, upon CP9 finally making their move and revealing themselves, in which Paulie initially attempted to claim to be some misunderstanding, Lucci showed his complete aloofness in revealing that their five years friendship was an act, and brutally attacked Paulie while rebuffing his claim that he still thought they were friends.
Candy Pirates
[
]
The crew invaded St. Poplar during one of their raids. Lucci attacked the captain while the other CP9 agents struck out at his crew. However, the citizens became horrified when Lucci took the attack too far, and began to show "excessive justice" against their captain by stepping on the pirate's skull.
Stussy
[
]
Lucci tries to kill Stussy, but fails.
Stussy
is one of Lucci's former fellow CP0 agents. They generally held a professional relationship, although Stussy cautioned Lucci several times about questioning and disobeying the World Government.
However, Lucci was shocked to find out Stussy was double agent for
Vegapunk
all along, betraying him and Kaku, which led to Lucci unsuccessfully attempting to kill her on the spot.
In the end, Lucci claimed he would never forgive Stussy for her betrayal and made good on his words after stabbing her later on with a Shigan, albeit unintended. After he and Kaku returned to their ship following the end of their mission, Lucci told a fellow Cipher Pol agent he killed Stussy.
Other
[
]
Hattori
[
]
Having known each other for twenty years,
Hattori
is the closest relationship Lucci has despite his infamous reputation as a mass-murderer. The pigeon is shown to be both loyal and unafraid of Lucci as he stays alongside his master even in dangerous situations. When Lucci is not fighting, Hattori is usually perched on his master's right shoulder. Lucci would have had to express some emotions to blend in with citizens while undercover, but Hattori did this for him as his ventriloquist dummy; this allowed Lucci to be somewhat sociable while remaining emotionless.
While Hattori reverted to being an ordinary pigeon after Lucci was revealed to be an assassin, he occasionally exhibits human traits such as drinking from a cup.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Even at a young age, Lucci was extremely deadly.
As the strongest member in
CP9
's entire history, Lucci garnered an infamous reputation even acknowledged by
Bartholomew Kuma
of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, who noted that no one could have foreseen Lucci's defeat.
Even at the tender age of 13, Lucci was already known to be a very capable mass murderer, having killed 500 of a kingdom's soldiers as well as a pirate crew single-handedly. By adulthood, Lucci had become by far the strongest agent in CP9 history,
with his
Doriki
at 4000 (almost twice that of the second strongest agent,
Kaku
's 2200).
Franky remarked that Lucci's strength was levels above the rest of CP9 and that, had it not been for Luffy holding him off with their fight, he was unsure how many of their comrades would have been slaughtered.
Since his first known loss to Luffy, Lucci grew more powerful and is now officially part of
CP0
, which is considered to be the strongest and most exclusive of the
Cipher Pols
.
He would also assume a position of authority within CP0, usually giving orders and instruction to other masked agents. However, he proved to be no match for Luffy after the young pirate become one of the
Four Emperors
. While he was able to fight against
Roronoa Zoro
, the "No. 2" of the Straw Hat Pirates, on even grounds, he was not able to defeat the pirate hunter and suffered serious wounds from him, effectively losing the fight.
Because of his reputation, Lucci is a very valuable asset to the
World Government
, almost to the point of legend.
Vice Admiral
Onigumo
even believed that he could survive a
Buster Call
attack.
Lucci is also a skilled
ventriloquist
, meaning he is capable of making his voice sound like it is coming from somewhere else, most notably from his pet pigeon
Hattori
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Having undergone extremely hard Rokushiki training from early childhood, Lucci has developed extraordinary physical prowess, well beyond any other CP9 agent; specifically, 400 times stronger than a common, armed soldier (eight times greater than the necessary minimum to be considered "superhuman") according to his
Doriki
, without transforming.
Lucci possesses tremendous durability and reserves of stamina. Even after taking a considerable amount of damage from Luffy's
Gear 2
attacks, Lucci barely flinched and resumed the battle after being slammed into two buildings by Luffy's
Gigant Pistol
, though he was almost knocked out and took heavy damage later. At only the age of 13, he came out untroubled, without showing any signs of pain after being shot at from behind by multiple cannon shots, only receiving the scars on his back.
Strength-wise, he could temporarily knock out Franky, a powerful
cyborg
immune to bullets, with a single blow before sending him crashing through a wall with a kick. He could block Sanji's kick with his forearm without using
Tekkai
. As a user of
Shigan
, his fingers are extremely strong, allowing him to penetrate stone pavement with a simple grip. Lucci also easily caught Luffy's face with one arm, despite his own great strength, while at the same time shrugging off all his punches, and then casually threw him into a wall.
During a brief confrontation against those who were trying to defend Shirahoshi from Charlos, Lucci was able to catch
Leo
, who is a very fast, small
dwarf
, and effortlessly push
Sai
, the leader of the
Happo Navy
, with a single kick.
Lucci is a highly skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant, as shown when he fought Luffy in their second match, before Luffy used Gear 2. Lucci fought an even battle with him without using his Devil Fruit powers, and was even slightly superior, as he got more hits on his opponent than the Straw Hat captain did to him. Furthermore, he barely used the more offensive techniques like Shigan and
Rankyaku
until Luffy started using his Gears.
Tactical Skills
[
]
Along with his great superhuman prowess, Lucci is a highly intelligent and cunning individual, being able to become a master carpenter within a 5-year period merely as a form of espionage and surveillance over his "boss" Iceburg (whom CP9 believed to have possession of the blueprints for the Ancient Weapon Pluton), and even when it was discovered otherwise, Lucci quickly deduced the next most likely candidate (Franky) based solely on their adolescent friendship. He and the other CP9 agents that infiltrated Water 7 deceived every single inhabitant, a clear sign of their manipulative skills.
A master tactician, Lucci managed to almost single-handedly eliminate the
Straw Hat Pirates
(excluding Luffy, whom he was battling) by understanding the structure of his environment and firing a well-aimed "Rankyaku" through a stone wall, flooding the ground floor of the Tower of Justice and all its hidden underground passages with seawater.
Had it not been for the unexpected arrival of Kokoro and her mermaid heritage, they would not have survived. He also quickly analyzed the mechanics behind Luffy's Gear 2 technique after engaging it for just a couple of minutes at most, explaining it to the rubber-man and stating that such bodily pressure would shave years off his lifespan.
The fact that he was able to reach the same level as the Galley La carpenters (who spend their whole life building their skills) in five years just to do an undercover job shows a great talent for it.
As an experienced spy, Lucci is very effective at gathering information and sending it to his superiors without arousing suspicion.
Admiral
Kizaru
and Saint
Marcus Mars
of the
Five Elders
have both praised Lucci for his intel gathering capabilities during the
Egghead Incident
.
Carpentry
[
]
Since Lucci worked as a shipwright during his mission on Water 7, this means that he has some carpentry skills and knowledge about
ships
. He worked as a sawyer, treenail, and bolt specialist. He, along with Kaku, was able to recognize that the Pluton blueprints Franky revealed on Enies Lobby were indeed real.
Rokushiki
[

Main article:
Rokushiki

Paulie
.
Lucci has the greatest mastery of Rokushiki within CP9's entire history, having developed more powerful variations from each of the different forms. He was able to skillfully use Soru and Shigan against 500 soldiers as a child, he fatally pierced their armor along with their bodies; he also used
Tekkai
to break two swords effortlessly.
By adulthood, Lucci's extraordinary skill in Rokushiki, combined with his Devil Fruit powers, allowed him to use improved variations of the martial art, such as
Rankyaku: Gaicho
, which could cleave through the iron hull of a
Marine battleship
, and
Tobu Shigan: Bachi
, which could pierce Luffy's rubber body with mere flicks of compressed air. In his hybrid form, a simple Rankyaku was enough to slice through the
Galley-La Headquarters
and cause most of the building to collapse. His high skill in Tekkai allowed him to casually block an attack from
Roronora Zoro
, a swordsman that can easily slice steel. Indeed, Franky's
Strong Hammer
, which sent his fellow CP9 agent
Fukurou
flying through two walls, despite his use of Tekkai, failed to make Lucci budge an inch, as the assassin's
Doriki
was five times his. Most notably, he used a hidden, seventh Rokushiki technique,
Rokuogan
, during his fight with Luffy. The massively powerful technique was so strong that it caused severe internal injury to Luffy's body, who described its effect as an
Impact Dial
with greatly amplified power, which is no small feat, considering that he is made of rubber. With his complete mastery of Rokushiki, in conjunction with his Devil Fruit ability, Lucci proved to be a tremendously resilient and formidable foe, fighting on equal footing with Luffy in Gear 2, even being slightly superior, forcing Luffy to use
Gear 3
to weaken him and in the end use all his forces against him.
Two years later, after his promotion to
CP0
and the awakening of his
Devil Fruit
, Lucci's skill in Rokushiki has only grown, as not only are his old techniques more powerful than before, but he has also exhibited completely new moves.
Seimei Kikan
[
]
Main article:
Seimei Kikan
It has been revealed that Lucci can perform Seimei Kikan, like
Kumadori
, and use it to alter his Zoan transformation that amplify his skills in a specific Rokushiki ability. However, only the
Kami-e Form
, which makes his man-beast form smaller and thinner, more like an average man-size, has been seen.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard
Lucci in his Human-Beast Leopard form.
Lucci ate the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard, a
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
which allows him to transform into a full leopard, or a bulky leopard-human hybrid at will.
As Zoan class Devil Fruits enhance physical capabilities the most, it is most favored by martial artists like Lucci, who is able to integrate the unique traits of his Devil Fruit, such as claws and stronger legs, to greatly enhance the effects of his techniques. Also, being a carnivorous animal, Lucci is more bloodthirsty and predatory than a regular Zoan class user, proven when he mauled Luffy as an actual leopard.
By using Seimei Kikan, Lucci can transform his bulky hybrid body into a more slender form. This smaller body greatly increases his speed, but at the cost of decreasing his Zoan enhanced strength.
Awakening
[
]
Lucci in his Awakened form.
Lucci has also achieved Devil Fruit
Awakening
, letting him assume a new, much more powerful hybrid form, which greatly enhances his physical strength, speed, as well as his recovery rate. Unlike most Awakened Zoans, Lucci's personality was not overtaken by the animal nature of the Devil Fruit.
In this awakened form, he could somewhat match Luffy, while in his own
Awakened form
for a time,
even meeting him in a fist clash and withstanding his
Gomu Gomu no Mogura Pistol
;
however, he was soon overpowered after Luffy started putting more force behind his attacks.
Nevertheless, Lucci was able to confront Zoro, a pirate with a bounty of over a billion, for an extended period of time while in this form, even managing to remain standing after being hit with a seemingly finishing move.

He demonstrated incredible skill with this form of Haki during his rematch against
Luffy
after the timeskip. While "Awakened", Lucci hardened his fists and clashed with the emperor who is a powerful Armament Haki master in his own right.
His hardened claws could also bypass
Sentomaru
's advanced-grade defensive Armament Haki.
Even in his human form, he could block Zoro's Haki enhanced swords with his hardened leg.
Non-canonically, he was also seen hardening his arm, while fighting

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Backstory
[
]
The anime follows the same trend for Lucci's back story, but with several differences and elaborations.
Thirteen-year-old Lucci in the anime.
After being sent, he approached the king, who begged Lucci to save the soldiers, but Lucci told the king not to question the ways of the World Government. This left the king to wonder what the Government was thinking, sending a young boy to such a dangerous assignment. Lucci stepped into the pirates' ship and claimed to serve justice against them, and they laughed and mocked him. After sarcastically telling Lucci to go home, two pirates attempted to strike him down with swords, but Lucci blocked it with his
Tekkai
.
The crew thought Lucci was using some
weird ability
, and the captain warned that if Lucci resisted anymore, the hostages would die. Then, with the crew pointing guns at Lucci's head, he ordered his men to take Lucci to the prison along with the other soldiers, as a way to insult the World Government. After the pirates locked Lucci in and mocked him further, Lucci ensured that all the hostages were there - then, using his
Rokushiki
techniques, he brutally massacred all 500 hostages while the oblivious pirate crew was still enjoying their celebration party.
When one of the pirates came to check out on the prisoners, he ran screaming for his captain - and the entire crew saw, to their horror and fury, all of their precious hostages murdered, with Lucci standing on top of the mountain of corpses, his victims' blood dripping from his hand. After a short argument on the
justice
of the
World Government
, the captain angrily ordered his crew to use their mortars - the very weapons that forced the soldiers to surrender - to kill Lucci, with five cannonballs striking Lucci right in the back. The captain said that Lucci deserved it for looking down on them, then complained how their perfect plan was ruined.
In the midst of his complaint, he saw, to his shock and horror, that Lucci had survived the blast and had stood back up from the inferno, with his back scarred a shape reminiscent of the World Government's logo. Lucci then used his
Soru
to swiftly appear before the captain and seized him by the face, then, despite the captain's futile attempt to pry himself free, Lucci launched a barrage of
Shigan
(much like
Shigan Oren
) to brutally stab the captain to death, letting his corpse crash down onto the ground. The remnants of the crew realized that the child in front of them is in fact a heartless monster who is immune to weapons and hostage situations, they knew they had no chance of winning, and screamed in horror while fleeing. Whether they were pursued and killed is not known. With that, Lucci's mission came to completion.
Regardless of which version, the scar that Lucci gained on his back vaguely resembles the symbol of the
World Government
. Also, Lucci's view of justice explained in the anime is also mentioned by Oda in an SBS, who says he cut it out of the manga in order for the story to move along faster.
Punk Hazard Arc

In the manga, Lucci appears in silhouette as one of the brokers watching
Caesar
's broadcast,
which is confirmed in
One Piece Doors!
Vol. 2
as well as
Vivre Card databook
listing an appearance for Lucci in the
Punk Hazard Arc
.
However, due to the ambiguity of the panel, the anime replaces Lucci with a different character with a thick mustache and a different voice actor.
