Taking Care of Garp's Grandsons
[
]
He is first seen with Dadan and the rest of the bandits when
Garp
came to leave
Luffy
in their care. When Dadan gets annoyed at Luffy during his first day at her house, Magra would try to calm Dadan down.
He was later seen, along with Dogra, when the two of them were keeping an eye on
Ace
and Luffy while they were in the forest together.
After Gray Terminal was set on fire, he was seen with Dadan and the rest of the bandits when they came to rescue Luffy and Ace from Bluejam. The bandits carried Luffy away when they ran from the fight. They managed to get away from the fire, but with Ace and Dadan nowhere to be seen, Magra and the other bandits cried. After returning to the Dadan house, Luffy wanted to make sure that Ace and Dadan were all right. Magra told Luffy that it is not safe to return to the Gray Terminal with the Goa soldiers there cleaning up after the fire. Magra did his best to calm Luffy down when he started getting distressed.
When Ace and Dadan returned, Magra and the other bandits were very happy to see them safe. Years later, Magra was seen with the other bandits bidding farewell to Ace when left to become a pirate.
