Kumadori
is an agent of
CP0
.
Before the time skip, he was an agent of
CP9
.
He is also the son of
Kumadori Yamanbako
.
He was one of the major antagonists during the
Enies Lobby Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Kumadori is a very tall man, standing exactly twice Nami's height pre-timeskip. He also has massive hands, a huge mane of pinkish hair, and a right eye that rarely seems to be open. His body positions (especially his penchant for holding one hand out in front of him) are also reminiscent of
mie
poses, and his vocal inflection is similar to that of
kabuki actors
. Also, in one of the covers of
CP9's Independent Report
, Kumadori is shown to have four scars: two large ones on his torso and a pair of smaller ones on his left arm.
Like other CP9 agents, he wears a black suit, black pants and a black shirt, but he also wore flip flops with green socks, a green tie, and hand guards covering the backs of his hands that were tied around his palm.
As a
CP0
agent, he wears the same suit but the only difference is the color being white.
In
SBS Volume 44
, Oda drew members of CP9 as children. Kumadori has been wearing his kabuki-style makeup since his youth and had his left eye closed instead of his right.
Personality
[
]
Kumadori is, overall, an eccentric character, perhaps the most within CP9. He seems to honor the samurai code of honor very heavily as he comically attempts to take his own life after dishonoring himself. As he accepts the blame for nearly anything, even the faults of others, this happens quite often in his appearances. Before he commits seppuku, however, he instinctively uses
Tekkai
, unintentionally saving his own life in a rather comical way. He thinks "real men" shouldn't cry or give up, which is why he kept fighting, even when confronted against Chopper's monster form. Kumadori also tried to keep Chopper from crying and from giving up because of his ideals.
He also seemed to be the most obedient and dutiful of the CP9 agents as he was the only one who intervened to help Spandam while he was attacked by Franky and knocked the cyborg away from his superior, though he also ironically sends Spandam crashing in the process, causing him more injuries.
Kumadori resembles a character in kabuki (traditional Japanese theater). He is a very loud character, and often punctuates his sentences with a loud, dramatic "YOYOI!!" He has a strange way of speaking, talks rather slowly and tends to repeat or draw out syllables and words in the manner of kabuki actors. He also has a penchant for spouting haiku, even during battles and at other inappropriate times. He often makes references to his "mother in heaven",
Kumadori Yamanbako
, then begins to sob, even while fighting. Before killing his opponents he often asks them to visit his mother in afterlife and tell her that he is okay. He claims her "divine protection" is the reason for his failure at committing seppuku. However, he seems unaware that she is still alive.
Kumadori claims to be a
sennin
(
仙人
?
, a type of hermit in Japanese folklore who can control even their body's autonomic functions, as well as live forever)
, which explains his ability to suddenly gain or lose weight by controlling the digestion and absorption of food, and the ability to control his hair.
He was also fond of his fellow CP9 agents as he helped raise money to pay for Lucci's treatment after his fight with Luffy and enjoyed spending time with his comrades at St. Poplar.

He usually combines his skills with his staff and Seimei Kikan to increase versatility.
Seimei Kikan
[
]
Further information:
Seimei Kikan
As a hermit, Kumadori can use Seimei Kikan to control his bodily functions to his desire. His main style of combat is to manipulate his hair to grasp his opponents or compress them into hands. He can also allow himself to digest food in an instant and losing all the excess weight at once.
Weapons
[
]
Kumadori wields a staff, known as a
Khakkhara
(
錫杖
,
shakujō
?
, literally meaning "tin stick")
, which he uses in conjunction with his
Rokushiki
. He can utilize his superhuman strength to stab the blunt end of the staff with tremendous force, capable of shattering stone.
He also carries a knife with a long blade and handle, strictly to commit hara-kiri with. The blade is quite resilient as it does not break when he instinctively uses
Tekkai
to protect himself from it.
Techniques
[
]
Shigan Cue
(
指銃
Q
,
Shigan Kyū
?
, literally meaning "Finger Gun: Cue")
: In this attack, Kumadori uses his blunt staff in the same way a finger is normally used in
Shigan
. The Q in the name is a reference to a pool cue, which is held in the same manner that Kumadori wields his staff.
In the Viz Manga and Funimation dub, this is called
Finger Pistol Q
.
Shishi Kebab
(
獅子樺蕪
,
Shishi Kababu
?
, literally meaning "Lion Kebab")
: Kumadori heats up the tip of his staff (possibly by using friction with his superhuman strength) and creates a fireball on that tip. He can shoot these fireballs as projectiles at his opponent at fast speeds, as well as use them to boost the destructive power of his staff's strikes.
The name is a pun on lion (shishi) and shish kebab, which is a food made through a method similar to how the attack is performed. In the Viz Manga and Funimation dub, this is called
Shishi Kabob
.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Kumadori,
Jabra
, and
Fukurou
were given a mission to assassinate three leaders within the
Revolutionary Army
, but Fukurou leaked the plot to the town, so the
CP9
agents were forced to kill 23 people.
Water 7 Saga

Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Kumadori dramatically apologizes to Spandam.
When Kumadori, Jabra, and Fukurou met with
Spandam
on
Enies Lobby
, the chief chastised them for their blown mission. In apology, Kumadori bowed his head to the floor, lifting his feet up into the air, and attempted
seppuku
; however, he instinctively used
Tekkai
, blocking the stab and causing him to get depressed on how he cannot die, which prompted Jabra to yell at him to just die.
The agents listened as Spandam received reports about
Monkey D. Luffy
and the
Franky Family
infiltrating the island.
Upon the reunion of all eight agents,
Rob Lucci
and Jabra began bickering, and Kumadori pleaded for them to stop. The agents then tested their strength on Fukurou, who ranked them based on
Doriki
. When Kalifa made fun of Spandam and kept claiming his actions to be sexual harassment, Kumadori stated how rude she was and decided to commit seppuku to atone on her behalf, but once again, he failed due to Tekkai, depressing him again and prompting him to wonder if his mother was keeping him alive.
Kumadori frees Spandam from Franky's mouth.
The agents then sat down, and the prisoners,
Nico Robin
and
Franky
, were brought before them. When Franky leapt forward and bit Spandam's head, Kumadori used his hair to slam Franky against the floor, separating the two men.
The agents watched as Spandam punished Franky and Robin and revealed his plan to take the
Straw Hat Pirates
as prisoners and send them to
Impel Down
since the pirates had come to Enies Lobby. Spandam dismissed the agents to their rooms.
Before they left, Spandam gave
Kaku
and Kalifa two Devil Fruits to eat; they were the first ones that Kumadori had ever seen.
Later, while
Blueno
was fighting Luffy, Jabra tried to dissuade Kaku and Kalifa from eating the fruits. Fukurou accused Jabra of fearing the pair growing stronger than him, and Kumadori pointed out that such jealousy stains a person's name. They then watched as Kaku and Kalifa ate the fruits and reacted to the disgusting tastes.
CP9 gathers atop the Tower of Justice.
After Luffy defeated
Blueno
, Spandam ordered the other agents to be summoned.
After stopping Franky from escaping with Robin, the agents gathered atop of the tower
and prepared to fight the Straw Hats, who all gathered atop the courthouse.
Spandam ordered the agents to kill any Straw Hat that enters the tower, and they then witnessed the chief boasting about his ability to summon a
Buster Call
and Robin warning about such an action. The Straw Hats declared war against the
World Government
as the drawbridge lowered.
When the drawbridge was stopped from completely lowering, Franky pulled out the blueprints for
Pluton
and incinerated them in front of the CP9 agents. The
Rocketman
then crashed out of the courthouse
and into the tower, carrying Franky and the Straw Hats across the gap.
Kumadori binds Nami.
Spandam ordered the other agents to deal with the Straw Hats while he fled with Robin. The agents each took a key to a set of
Seastone
cuffs and went to different areas of the tower. Kumadori sat in the underground prison and encountered
Nami
.
After binding her with his hair, he attempted to stab her with his staff, but she escaped by slipping her arms out of her jacket
and fled to the first floor. Kumadori snuck up behind her and bound her again with his hair. He recited a poem while choking her and preparing to stab her. However,
Tony Tony Chopper
in
Arm Point
arrived and struck Kumadori across the face, knocking the agent into a wall and freeing Nami. Instead of fighting, the two pirates fled since Nami had already stolen the agent's key.
After
Sanji
fell from above, Kumadori stood back up, so Chopper chose to face him while Nami left to fight Kalifa. When Kumadori tried to stop Nami, Chopper struck him in the torso.
As their fight continued, Kumadori knocked Chopper through a wall into the pantry. Before Kumadori could finish off Chopper, the reindeer trapped him in the large refrigerator. When Franky ran out of energy, Chopper had to briefly open the refrigerator to grab various drinks, but Kumadori was unable to escape in time.
After consuming all of the food in the refrigerator, a fattened Kumadori broke out
and then used
Seimei Kikan
to quickly digest and absorb the food, returning to his normal physique. When Chopper compared him to an octopus, Kumadori was insulted and insisted on being called a lion. When they resumed fighting, Kumadori repeatedly failed to bind and stab Chopper due to the reindeer's ability to change size, but his Tekkai was too strong for Chopper to break. Kumadori then ignited the butt of his staff and managed to severely injure Chopper after the reindeer resorted to eating a second
Rumble Ball
and could not properly control his transformations. Kumadori shaped his hair into multiple hands and stabbed Chopper.
Kumadori's hair and staff continued stabbing Chopper as he struggled to enter the right form. When Chopper finally entered Arm Point, Kumadori tried to defend with Tekkai, but the reindeer's attack broke through and heavily damaged Kumadori. However, the agent refused to fall and continued attacking the exhausted reindeer.
Chopper carries out a defeated Kumadori.
Kumadori then lifted Chopper up and tried to stab him one last time, but the reindeer slipped out and ate a third Rumble Ball, transforming into a giant monster, which frightened Kumadori.
Kumadori moved to the monster's back and tried to attack, but Chopper smacked him out of the air and repeatedly bashed him into the floor. Chopper then carried the bloodied and defeated Kumadori out to the balcony and threw him all the way to the square in front of the courthouse. The Marines there were surprised to find the unconscious CP9 agent.
CP9's Independent Report
[
]
Kumadori performs to earn money.
Despite the whole island being bombarded by the Buster Call, Kumadori and the other agents survived and gathered together amongst the ruins. After Blueno brought over Lucci and, along with Jabra, overheard that Spandam had scapegoated the agents, Kumadori carried an unconscious Lucci along the
Sea Train
tracks. Having arrived at
St. Poplar
, Kumadori and the others performed in the street to pay the medical fees for Lucci's recovery.
After paying for Lucci's medical fees, they used the rest to buy clothes and other essentials. While shopping, Kumadori shared food with
Hattori
.
Later, Lucci was discharged from the hospital to general celebration. He seemed to enjoy himself as he and the other agents of
CP9
went bowling, particularly when Kalifa used her explosive strength to smash the bowling ball through the wall (let alone the pins).
However, the
Candy Pirates
appeared and began ransacking St. Poplar. Thus Kumadori, along with the rest of CP9, stopped their bowling match to save the kidnapped citizens by beating up the offending pirates. Lucci went too far and killed the captain, which shocked the onlookers, and CP9 realized they could not stay in the city anymore.
However, a little girl gave Kalifa a flower to thank her for saving the town, with Kumadori, Fukurou, and Jabra frightened. Taking this gift and commandeering the Candy Pirates' ship, they sailed back to their homeland.
Upon arrival, they watched the next generation of CP9 agents being trained.
As they were watching, they found out the pursuers that Spandam sent had caught up with them. In order to protect their homeland from these people, the agents dealt with the Marines and then commandeered
Very Good
's ship. During the fight, Lucci gave their former leader a message that they would come back for him someday. Before sailing off from their homeland, the agents planted the gifted flower on the shore of the island.
During the Timeskip
[
]
Sometime during the timeskip, Kumadori and the other former members of CP9 began training to become stronger. They eventually uncovered a plot in which
Spandine
was scheming some kind of takeover with former Level 6 prisoners from
Impel Down
as well as parties from the
Underworld
. They attacked and destroyed the parties involved and for their efforts were reinstated as agents of
CP0
.

Early Concepts
[
]
Above, Apollo (Kumadori) is at the very left, and below, he is second to the left.
In
One Piece Green: Secret Pieces
it is revealed that the early concept of Kumadori looked nothing like what he is now. His name was also different; it was originally supposed to be Apollo (アポロ). His body build was not too different from the current version, but he looked more like a gorilla in terms of the body shape, and he had what appears to be face paintings. He somewhat resembles a train conductor with his outfit.
