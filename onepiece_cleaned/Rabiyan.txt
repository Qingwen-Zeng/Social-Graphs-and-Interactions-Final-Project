History

Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Rabiyan flew
Charlotte Pudding
and
Nitro
to where Pudding's cafe,
Caramel
, used to be, interrupting a dispute between the police and the pirates
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Tony Tony Chopper
.
While Pudding talked to the
Sanji Retrieval Team
in her house, Rabiyan spread out on the floor and played with
Carrot
.
Two days later, Rabiyan and Nitro watched as Pudding talked with
Sanji
in her room.
Later Pudding shot and captured
Vinsmoke Reiju
, and in Pudding's Room, Nitro restrained Reiju while Rabiyan floated nearby. There Pudding revealed her plan to murder Sanji during the wedding
and started making faces to predict what Sanji's reaction would be, causing Rabiyan and Nitro to laugh hysterically.
On the day of the wedding, Rabiyan was in Pudding's room, expressing concern for a sad Pudding.
Rabiyan transporting Chiffon, Pudding, and Sanji in their quest to make Big Mom a wedding cake.
After the Whole Cake Chateau collapsed and Big Mom began suffering a craving illness for wedding cake, Rabiyan was seen carrying Pudding and Nitro as Pudding explained her plan to satiate Big Mom's craving to her siblings.
Rabiyan then carried Pudding to Bege, so she could ask Chiffon for help.
After Chiffon agreed to go with Pudding, Rabiyan took them to the Seducing Woods, where they located Sanji.
As Sanji and his group were fleeing from Big Mom, Rabiyan and the two sisters approached them. After Chiffon requested Sanji's help in making a cake for Big Mom, Sanji agreed to assist them and hopped on the carpet homie. Rabiyan then flew for Cacao Island.
Rabiyan later brought Pudding, Chiffon, and Sanji to Chocolat Town on Cacao Island. Until they arrived at the Sweets Factory, Sanji hid inside Rabiyan's folds.
While approaching the Thousand Sunny on Bege's ship, the
Nostra Castello
, Pudding and Sanji left the cake in Bege's hands and used Rabiyan to fly to the Sunny, with Sanji hiding in Rabiyan's folds.
After Sanji reunited with the Sunny group and informed them of the Big Mom Pirates' awareness of their rendezvous point, Rabiyan transported Sanji and Pudding back to Cacao Island to help Luffy.
Much later as Pudding sat in an alley at Cacao Island after parting ways with Sanji, Rabiyan and Nitro were by Pudding's side when she cried thinking about Sanji.
