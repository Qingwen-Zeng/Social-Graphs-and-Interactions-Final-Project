Appearance
[
]
Wapol is an overweight man with an unusual appearance. He has dark violet hair and a cylinder-shaped jaw made up of tin plates, hence his epithet. When Wapol uses his Slim-Up technique, he "eats" his body and becomes slim. During the Drum Island Arc, he used to dress in tin-plate armor and a hooded cape made from
White Walkie
skin. He was also wearing brown thick gloves. He spotted a pair of purple and orange woolen shorts and a brown belt around his waist and a pair of thick short boots.
When he was the ruler of the Drum Peak, he was wearing the same attire but the tin-plate armor. Instead, he was wearing a grey shirt, and his gloves had no fur on their upper edge.
After the timeskip, as the monarch of the
Evil Black Drum Kingdom
he spots a different attire. He wears another shirt and when it comes to his lower body, he wears a skirt with a black pattern, a pair of black sharp pointy sandals. He still has his hooded cape, and he wears black gloves. His hair is now white, and he has grown a black mustache and a goatee.

Personality
[
]
Wapol was once a prince of the region who succeeded his father, a king beloved by the people of Drum, as monarch when his father died. Wapol however, proved to be a spoiled and corrupt king, who held not even the slightest regard for his subjects. He was also cowardly and disloyal, fleeing his kingdom without even fighting back when the
Blackbeard Pirates
attacked, taking with him the doctors and soldiers while leaving his remaining citizens to fend for themselves. His self-centered actions ruined the kingdom's reputation, which caused all people of Drum Ilse to both fear and hate him.
He ruled simply to satisfy his selfish desires and oft brutally beat anyone who disobeyed him. Being rather callous towards his people while never appearing to care for their safety. Wapol loved to dominate over others with his family's power and wealth, and truly believed that none should dare question his authority. The former king in particular held little to no understanding of politics or governmental issues, foolishly believing that everything is fine as long as it does not directly affect his fief. Being used to having everything go his way, Wapol was meanspirited enough to attack 10-year-old
Nefertari Vivi
, in the hopes of instigating a full-scale war, simply for being scolded by her father for his irresponsibility. Only to be infuriated when she did not blame him for this act of spite.
Perhaps because of his selfish nature to claim whatever he wants, Wapol is unable to learn from his mistakes, as even though he lived as a homeless man and was forced to make a living by selling toys, he made an enormous fortune and became just as self-centered and arrogant as he was while as a monarch. In fact, he is one to hold grudges and seek means to act on them, as he only intended to attend
Levely
solely so he could get revenge on Dalton for becoming the new ruler of his old domain, however he does not appear to bear a grudge against
Luffy
, as he mentioned that the latter's actions allowed him to regain power and a new kingdom. Despite this, he has become more considerate for in spite of disliking Cobra, he is horrified to find him unreasonably assassinated by the Five Elders simply for learning Imuâ€™s existence. After escaping with Vivi, he also did not immediately divulge what he saw due to her father being killed which he knew would be difficult for her to accept.
Though Wapol may look and act childish, he is by no means stupid, as demonstrated when he saw through Nami's lies and managed to figure out an effective, though cruel and amoral method of controlling the denizens. Before Wapol's ascension to power, the
Drum Kingdom
possessed the most numerous and skilled doctors in all of the
Grand Line
. He took the twenty most skilled for himself while
banishing or murdering the rest
, to ensure that his subjects would remain absolutely loyal and grovel at his feet for medical attention. He is also not so much of a buffoon that he'd defy the World Nobles. Despite prior beliefs that the World Government would ensure that the Revolutionaries would be unable to harm him or his region of power, Wapol knew the consequences of stumbling onto the secret holder of the Empty Throne, casting aside any delusion that he is safe from harm so long as he is affiliated with the organization.
Wapol is very gluttonous, which he takes to the extreme with his Devil Fruit powers. He eats as he pleases, non-stop, and caused massive collateral damage to small towns which led him to be arrested once. He also has a habit of saying kaba ("hippo") instead of saying baka ("idiot"). This, along with his entitled and juvenile character flaws, makes him a somewhat comedic villain, despite his depravity.
He also seems willing to use cannibalism, as seen when he attempted to eat Luffy and later, in Drum, after hearing from Kuromarimo that Doctor Kureha lives in his castle, he said he was going to eat her.
Wapol has a unique face-fault when left utterly dumbstruck once something terrible happens at his expense- a very wide-eyed blank stare with veins bulging out of his eyes, coupled with a stupefied smile, giving off an overall look that suggests he is about to snap in a psychotic rage.
He does have a sense of caution when he tells
Nefertari Vivi
to pipe down since there are many
Den Den Mushi
in the
World Economy News Paper
's blimp. He is also visibly disturbed when Charlos attempts to enslave Shirahoshi, showing that his cruelty does have limits.
Like many characters in One Piece, Wapol has a
distinct laugh
: starting with either "Ma" or a long "Ma" (i.e Mahahahahaha!/Maaaaaahahahahaha).
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Wapol's Father
[
]
Wapol's father was a just king who wished for the well-being of his people and was well loved. Unfortunately, Wapol never followed this type of reign. Wapol's father was well aware of his son's terrible personality while he was a child, according to Dalton it was because he spoiled Wapol. Wapol's father seemingly wanted to raise him into a kind, caring king like himself but failed to do so in the end.
Musshuru
[
]
In the
ninth One Piece movie
, which is a non-canonical retelling of the Drum Island Arc, Wapol has an older brother named
Musshuru
. Wapol's relationship with Musshuru is somewhat double sided. While he acts like a submissive younger brother when around his brother, Wapol in reality has no real respect for Musshuru. He generally views Musshuru as an idiot that he has to put up with in order for his plan in the movie to succeed. Wapol merely uses Musshuru as a tool and even goes as far as to eating his older brother in order to become a stronger combined being with both Wapol's and Musshuru's Devil Fruit powers.
Kinderella
[
]
After Wapol became successful in his toy making business and opened his own company, Kinderella married Wapol and lived a luxurious life with him. Two years later, she is still married to Wapol and they are now the king and queen of the new Evil Black Drum Kingdom. However, when Wapol was later forced to flee from the Levely after accidentally witnessing Cobra's murder with Vivi, Kinderella mistakenly thought the two were "eloping".
Crew
[
]
Wapol used to command a large amount of soldiers. However, the only ones that he was close to were his counselors
Chess
and
Kuromarimo
. They were both very loyal to Wapol. Chess used to write every new law that Wapol made.
Wapol also had Robson under his possession. He is a White Walkie, aka Wooly Hippo. Wapol killed some of his brothers, making him very unhappy with him. Wapol rode him as his personal transport, to the point that he was able to take him up the Drum Rockies.
Before he was exiled, Wapol initiated a "Doctor Hunt" throughout the nation. According to his logic, by forcing every doctor except for his
Isshi-20
to leave, the citizens would have to grovel at his feet in order to get any medical attention, which would keep them under his control. While they were under Wapol's control, they secretly despised and hated him as the rest of the people did. However, they gave in to the king in order to continue their research and refine their techniques. Upon seeing the quack,
Dr. Hiriluk
's noble sacrifice, the Isshi-20 became determined to never lose to the quack. To this end, they hoped to use their research and techniques to help their compatriots. When Wapol fled the kingdom, he took the Isshi-20 with him.
Levely
[
]
Wapol is highly egotistical, and believes he is more important than anyone else in his kingdom. He has neither time nor care for political events concerning the world that do not affect his country, such as
Dragon
and the movements of his
revolutionaries
. He also displays a huge lack of diplomacy skills altogether in dealing with other leaders. This made him unpopular in the
Levely
, and
Nefertari Cobra
scolded Wapol for his lack of care, which resulted in Wapol storming out. On the street outside, Wapol saw Cobra's daughter,
Vivi
, and intentionally knocked her down as he walked past, but instead of bursting out crying, the
princess
tactfully apologized, saying it was her fault. Seeing that his spiteful act did not turn out as he had planned, Wapol angrily departed the summit. Ironically eight years later after the Levely he would find himself helping Vivi, the same girl he whacked without any hesitation finds themselves on the same boat, with Morgans sheltering them.
Years later, Wapol now only intends to attend the Levely solely so he can take down Dalton. Despite his dislike of Cobra, he was horrified to witness his death at the hands of
Imu
and the
Five Elders
, finding himself unable to celebrate due to the terrifying secrets of the World Government.
World Government
[
]
Originally, Wapol was blindly loyal to the World Government, which led him believe that they would not allow anything to happen to his country, even the actions of the Revolutionary would not reach him. After being ousted from his birthright kingdom and becoming a successful CEO of a toy enterprise, the World Nobles granted him a new kingdom as recognition for his achievements, furthering his loyalty to the organization. However, this relationship would come to an unfortunate end when Wapol witnessed the Government's greatest secret: the
Empty Throne
is actually occupied by the enigmatic
Imu
. When the
Five Elders
noticed Wapol seeing them murder King Cobra, he fled, knowing full well they would kill him at all cost. However, Wapol escaped from
Mary Geoise
and is currently hiding after he became a fugitive.
Enemies
[
]
Dalton
[
]
Dalton
was once a humble servant of King Wapol, who originally obeyed the orders of his King through loyalty. Dalton however, unlike other members of the Kingdom ministers, had a conscience, and once he was encouraged by Hirilukâ€™s actions, he refused to be Wapol's obedient guard any longer. After Wapol fled Drum Island, Dalton harbored a deep hatred for his former king, and refused to allow him to revert Drum Island back to what it was before his departure. Even two years after his defeat, Wapol still thinks lowly of Dalton and intended to take him down at the Levely. When they met again at
Mary Geoise
, they were displeased to see each other. Wapol yelled at him by calling him a servant, but Dalton firmly stated that they were now equals. His tone also sounded threatening as Wapol backed off.
Hiriluk
[
]
When Wapol declared a Doctor Hunt, he saw
Hiriluk
as one of his two main threats to controlling the kingdom, despite the doctor being a quack. Upon Hiriluk's suicide, Wapol and his loyal subordinates Chess and Kuromarimo laughed. They were the only three to do so, having no respect for the doctor whatsoever.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
The
Straw Hat Pirates
first encountered the Bliking Pirates out on the sea. Using their submersible ship, the Bliking, the crew ambushed the Straw Hats, but when Wapol tried to eat Luffy, he was merely knocked into the ocean, forcing the rest of the crew to leave in order to rescue him. Dalton, who tried to form a new government on Drum, helped the crew find a doctor for a sick
Nami
. Later on, following the Straw Hats for revenge, the crew finally found themselves back on their home island, and Wapol decided to return to his throne. However, he was defeated by Luffy and Chopper.
After the timeskip, Wapol does not seem to bear a grudge against Luffy, as he mentioned that the latter's actions allowed him to regain power and a new kingdom.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As king of the
Evil Black Drum Kingdom
, Wapol has full authority over the kingdom and its citizens and is able to attend
Levely
. He formerly possessed this authority on
Drum Island
before he fled and was eventually overthrown.
Tactical Skills
[
]
Wapol possesses a surprising amount of cunning, as he came up with a strategy to subjugate his country and later on, he came up with another strategy to catch Dr. Hiriluk by exploiting his personality. During his final fight with Luffy and Chopper, Wapol also thought of several ideas to give him an advantage, such as merging his two servants and consuming his castle's hidden arsenal and exploiting the towers super cannon. He also proved himself to be a skilled businessman, having successfully created an entire toy enterprise based on a metal he (unintentionally) discovered, to such an astounding popularity and success that he became even richer than when he was king of Drum Island, his wicked nature eventually being acknowledged by the World Nobles to which they awarded him a new kingdom. He is also observant with a strong sense of danger as after he secretly discovered Cobra being killed for learning about Imuâ€™s existence, he's also quick witted enough to hurriedly escape due to knowing he will be implicated and assassinated by the Five Elders for this discovery, while contacting Morgans as he knew only the famous journalistâ€™s connections could help him escape from the World Government.
Physical Abilities
[
]
He seems to lack battle or combat experience, and he mainly relies on his henchmen to perform such tasks. While living as a pirate, the disgraced liege and his crew were capable of surviving on the treacherous waters of the Grand Line. Wapol and his cabinet managed to subdue an entire nation, Dr. Kureha once stating his ironfisted rule was only tolerated due to everyone fearing him and his military might. Having bested Dalton quite handily in his "ultimate form" being a testament to such claims. It should be noted that Wapol did not get the chance to use this ultimate form during his battle with Luffy, which he would have achieved by eating all of Drum Castle's weapons, because Nami stole the key to the armory from him. Despite his obesity, Wapol has impressive durability, having quickly gotten back up after
Dalton
's sword strike on him and two consecutive punches in the face by Luffy. He can become rather agile after using the slim Wapol technique.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Baku Baku no Mi
Wapol using his powers to battle Luffy.
Wapol ate the Baku Baku no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
which allows him to expand his mouth and eat virtually anything, as well as transform his body to replicate the characteristics and function of whatever he's eaten in the most recent 24 hours. For example, if he eats a cannon, then he can transform a part of his body into a cannon. He is capable of using multiple manifestations at once.
He also has the ability to reconfigure ingested objects in his belly and regurgitate them, creating something new. He used this ability to produce a new shape-memory steel called
Wapometal
. He can even use this power to devour people whole and "combine" them within himself, allowing him to combine his subordinates into a single more powerful warrior.
Wapol can devour his own body until only his lower jaw is left, then regurgitate himself with his body temporarily altered to be better suited for combat.
Weapons
[
]
Wapol had in his possession the
Royal Drum Crown 7-Shot Bliking Cannon
. Wapol was going to use it to defeat Monkey D. Luffy, but he could not get the cannon working due to the freezing conditions and the cannon barrels becoming a nest for Snow Birds.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
During his childhood, he was a spoiled child whose troublesome behavior made his father worried about him. When his father (the previous king) died, Wapol inherited the throne and became the new king of Drum Island. Six years before the current storyline, Wapol now 21, exiled all of the country's doctors, with the exception of his personal doctors, the
Isshi-20
. These doctors were forced into servitude by Wapol as he believed he could control the citizens of Drum by forcing them to personally beg him for medical treatment and pay an inordinate amount of money. Only two other doctors,
Hiriluk
and
Kureha
, managed to elude Wapol's grasp.
Cobra scolds Wapol for his selfish behavior at the meeting in Mary Geoise.
In the midst of his rule, Wapol attended the world meeting in
Mary Geoise
. There he was told of the revolutionary named
Dragon
and how he would be a threat to the world in the next five to six years. Wapol, not caring about the situation at all since he believed his Drum Kingdom would not fall to Dragon, simply picked his nose and shrugged the whole matter off.
Nefertari Cobra
, the king of
Arabasta
, not believing Wapol's selfish reply, scolded him for not taking the whole situation more seriously.
Angered for being scolded by Cobra, Wapol tried to get even by intentionally hitting his ten-year-old daughter,
Vivi
, and saying it was an accident. Despite being hit however, Vivi simply apologized to Wapol instead of making a big deal out of the whole matter. Afterward, Vivi was seen crying with
Igaram
, and
Dalton
saw her crying. Wapol, unable to accomplish anything with his actions, decided to just leave and go back to Drum.
One year later, Wapol decided to lay a trap for Hiriluk. By spreading a rumor amongst his people that the
Isshi-20
were sick, Wapol believed that Hiriluk would foolishly come to save them. Sure enough, Hiriluk did respond to the news and Wapol was informed of the doctor's arrival. With several of his men, Wapol then boastfully told Hiriluk that the doctor was tricked when he finally arrived in front of Wapol's castle.
However, before Wapol could give the order to execute Hiriluk by firing squad, Hiriluk told the king and his men to wait and gave a speech on how there was only one way a person would truly die. This brought tears to Wapol's Captain of the Guard,
Dalton
. Wapol however was unmoved by the whole matter. Wapol and his men then witnessed as Hiriluk blew himself up. The entire sight made Wapol laugh as he found Hiriluk an idiot for killing himself.
Wapol defeats Dalton for his insubordination.
Wapol's laughter at Hiriluk's death however angered
Chopper
who had arrived at the area. Enraged, Chopper flew into a berserk rage while activating Heavy Point for the second time and attempted to attack Wapol only to be stopped by Dalton. Dalton then convinced Chopper to leave the area. Wapol, wondering why Dalton simply let him go, questioned him. Dalton then spoke up against Wapol about how reviled he and the government under his rule acted towards the country and its occupants. The former commander telling his king that no matter how good their country's medical skills were, there was no cure for Wapol's foolhardiness.
Angered by his commandants insubordination, Wapol transformed into a massive form consisting of various weapons and defeated Dalton. The tyrant then imprisoned Dalton for a week until he apologized to him for his impudence.
Wapol continued to rule tyrannically over Drum Kingdom until the
Blackbeard Pirates
arrived on the island about two to three months before the current storyline. The moment Wapol and those loyal to him realized that the pirates were too strong for them to fight, they immediately abandoned the country and fled to the sea on the
Bliking
. Only Dalton and the people of Drum Island were left behind to face the enemy alone. Wapol and his men, disguised as pirates, then wandered the seas trying to find their way back to their home nation.
Arabasta Saga
[

Drum Island Arc
[
]
Wapol asks if the Straw Hats have an Eternal Pose to Drum.
After waiting patiently for a time as a pirate, Wapol decided to return to Drum and resume his throne. He and his men came across the
Going Merry
and boarded the ship. With the Straw Hats temporarily held up at gun point, Wapol asked if they had any
Eternal Poses
to Drum. The Straw Hats had neither an Eternal Pose to Drum nor had heard about the country before. Wapol, seeing as he could not get anything useful from them, decided to steal any treasure they had on them. Before stealing anything from them however, Wapol decided to dine on the ship, literally. As he ate parts of the ship, the Straw Hats started to retaliate against their captors.
Luffy
in particular decided to attack Wapol directly. Wapol merely retaliated by swallowing most of Luffy. Wapol, however, had a hard time trying to chew Luffy due to his rubbery body, and Luffy's unswallowed and outstretched arms came back to hit Wapol. With a strike from Luffy's arms, Wapol spat out Luffy and was catapulted to the open sea.
Fortunately for Wapol, his men were able to fish him out before he could drown.
He and his men then continued looking for a way back to Drum.
The next day, Wapol and his men were able to reach Drum. Upon arriving, they were met with a small resistance from Wapol's former subjects, who were guarding the entrance. After dealing with them, Wapol decided to head back to his castle aboard
Robson
and resume his reign. However, before he could set off, Wapol was then informed by one of his men that the Straw Hats had also landed in Drum. Wanting to get back at them for what they did to him, Wapol decided to go to the town of Big Horn following the Straw Hats' trail.
Dalton confronts Wapol in Bighorn.
In
Bighorn
, Wapol and his men seized the town. With some of the houses in ruins, Wapol began eating the town itself. Wapol was then informed that the Straw Hats had headed to his castle looking for Dr.
Kureha
, who decided to live there. Angered by this, Wapol decided to eat her along with Luffy for the troubles they caused him. Before he and his men could set off to his castle, however, Wapol was attacked by his former Captain of the Guard,
Dalton
. Luckily for Wapol, the
Isshi-20
were able to stitch Wapol back up from his injury from Dalton's attack.
After being fixed up, Wapol talked with a defiant Dalton about the way he ruled before and his decision to exile most of their kingdom's doctors. In the midst of their discussion, Wapol ordered his men to execute the traitor. Dalton, however, was able to dodge most of Wapol's men with the power of
his Devil Fruit
.
Chess
, Wapol's Minister of Defense, however, countered this by shooting at some villagers who attempted to help Dalton. Dalton, being the person he is, stood in the line of fire and got hit by Chess' arrows. The entire situation made Wapol laugh. Suddenly, just in the middle of things, an avalanche appeared coming from Drum Peak to Bighorn.
Wapol attempts to escape the avalanche aboard Robson.
Hopping onto Robson, along with Chess and
Kuromarimo
, Wapol attempted to escape from the avalanche, leaving the majority of his men behind. Unfortunately for Wapol, he and the cohorts with him were not able to escape from the avalanche. Buried under tons of snow, Wapol chewed a way out and spat out Chess and Kuromarimo who he accidentally swallowed along with the snow. Angered by the situation, Wapol figured that the entire avalanche was part of some plan concocted by the Straw Hats. With Chess and Kuromarimo, Wapol riding aboard Robson rushed up the mountain and caught up with Luffy.
Upon catching up with Luffy, Wapol was completely ignored by Luffy due to the current circumstances involving
Sanji
and
Nami
.
Wapol, angered by this, created a new law stating that whoever ignored the king like that would be put to death. He then ordered Chess and Kuromarimo to attack Luffy and the two Straw Hats he was carrying. Wapol and his two cohorts then gave Luffy a hard time, though Luffy was able to keep dodging their attacks and keep both Sanji and Nami safe. Just in the middle of things however, several
Lapahns
came out and began protecting Luffy and company. With the Lapahns blocking their path, Luffy was able to escape from Wapol and his cohorts. After some time battling against the Lapahns, Wapol and his cohorts were able to defeat the giant rabbits. They then continued going towards Wapols castle.
Using Robson, Wapol and his two cohorts were able to scale the cliffs of the Drum Peak and reach his castle.
Having returned to his castle, Wapol decided to reclaim his throne. However, before he could celebrate, Wapol noticed that the Drum Kingdom's flag, that usually adorned the top of his castle, was replaced with a pirate flag. Wapol was then greeted by Kureha alongside Chopper. Kureha told Wapol to leave as his castle was now Hiriluk's tomb and the kingdom he once ruled was gone. Wapol was then met by Luffy who punched him directly in the face.
Having nearly been punched off the mountain by Luffy, Wapol regained his footing and decided to fight against those who stood in his way. He first sent both Chess and Kuromarimo to fight ahead. As he sent them forward to fight against Sanji, who had arrived at the scene, and Chopper, Wapol realized that Chopper was the same creature that attacked him when Hiriluk died. In the middle of the fight, Wapol swallowed Chopper as he came at Chess. Wapol however was hit in stomach by Luffy and so spat Chopper out before he could devour him. As Wapol flew due to the impact, he accidentally hit Robson along the way and sent the hippo flying away from his castle.
Wapol House.
After regaining himself once again, Wapol decided to show his opponents the power of his
Baku Baku Factory
and asked Chess to relate to his opponents what he ate recently. Chess did so as commanded. Wapol then showed what he could do with the stuff he ate. He transformed into a house with cannons for arms. He then devoured both Chess and Kuromarimo and combined them into a new being called
Chessmarimo
which emerged out of the door in the middle of Wapol's stomach. Wapol then decided to shoot down the pirate flag on top of his castle as he found it repulsive.
For this however, Chopper became enraged. Passing through Chessmarimo, Chopper climbed on top of Wapol and almost punched him in the face. Chopper however instead asked Wapol to leave. Seeing an opening due to Chopper's hesitation, Wapol shoot Chopper off him. Just then Wapol noticed that Luffy restored the pirate flag to its place. With Luffy holding the flagpole up and a part of the jacket Luffy was wearing holding the entire thing together, Luffy told Wapol that he and his men were nothing but frauds since they did not know the true meaning of the flag.
Wapol, upon hearing Luffy's words against him, decided to shoot Luffy down along with the flag. However, despite Wapol shooting directly at Luffy, Luffy stood his ground carrying the flag. Not believing the situation at all, Wapol decided to shoot Luffy once again.
However, before he could, Wapol was attacked by Chopper. Chessmarimo blocked the attack. Protecting his master, Chessmarimo stated that he would defeat a creature like Chopper who does not have anyone. Luffy disagreed and catapulted himself towards Wapol and Chessmarimo. After getting back up from the impact created by Luffy, Wapol prepared to fight him while Chessmarimo fights against Chopper. However, while Wapol and Luffy had prepared to fight against each other, Luffy got caught up watching Chopper's fight with Chessmarimo. With Luffy and everyone busy, Wapol saw a good opportunity.
Slim-up Wapol.
While Chopper fought against
Chessmarimo
and everyone was not looking, Wapol snuck back into his castle without anyone noticing. Inside, he is shocked and angered by the condition his castle had become. Wapol then noticed
Nami
and decided to attack her. As Wapol gave chase after Nami, his fat body gets caught in one of the stairway passages. To rectify, Wapol eats himself completely until his lower jaw is all that is left. Inside his "mouth", which looks like a bucket, Wapol rearranged his bones and muscles in order to become a slimmer and taller version of himself. In this form, Wapol decided to continue attacking Nami. Just when Wapol caught Nami however, Luffy came in and kicked Wapol in the face.
After getting back up, Wapol then tries to eat all the weapons inside his massive armory in order to turn himself into a super-weapon to fight against Luffy. Unfortunately, Nami had managed to steal the key to the armory from him when Wapol caught her earlier. Realizing he could not open the armory, Wapol decided to run away from Luffy in order to get to his trump card, the Royal Drum Crown 7-Shot Bliking Cannon, high within in his castle. Just when Wapol got to it and was about to fire the cannon at Luffy, the cannon did not fire. It turned out that the cannon had become a bird's nest while it was unmaintained, and the nest was clogging up the cannon's firing mechanism. Angered by this, Wapol yelled at the bird that decided to live in the cannon. In midst of his anger however, Luffy grabbed Wapol's entire jaw with his hand.
As Luffy held onto Wapol's jaw, Wapol threatened that what Luffy was doing here was an international crime since Drum is a part of the
World Government
. Unmoved, Luffy held firm to Wapol's mouth as he told Wapol that it did not matter to him. Wapol, responding to this, opened his mouth as wide as he could to swallow Luffy. Luffy's grip, however, simply stretched as it held onto Wapol's mouth. Wapol then countered this by turning his tongue into a cannon and firing it at Luffy. The resulting explosion blew a hole in Wapol's tower. Just when it seemed that Wapol had won, Luffy suddenly popped out from behind Wapol.
Luffy defeats Wapol.
Luffy latched onto Wapol and catapulted him up to the roof with his
Gomu Gomu no Bow Gun
technique. Lodged at the very tip of the roof, Wapol was placed before Hiriluk's pirate flag. Luffy then came up to the roof to finish off Wapol. As Luffy prepared to send Wapol flying off with a very long
Gomu Gomu no Bazooka
, Wapol pleaded to Luffy to spare him by offering various rewards such as a position in his government. In a last-ditch effort before being hit by Luffy, Wapol offered to make Luffy a "Vice-King" of Drum. Luffy completely ignored Wapol's pleas and sent Wapol flying far off from Drum.

Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah
[
]
After Wapol's second exile from his homeland, he wandered around the Grand Line in an eating spree and became fat again. He began eating various things from lamps to benches. He then transformed into them in order to eat more stuff. Soon even towns became his dessert. He was practically having the time of his life, eating stuff and causing misfortune to those around him.
Eventually however, Wapol's actions caught the attention of the
Marines
and he was soon arrested by two Marines who do not recognize him as a king, shocking Wapol.
A cutaway reveals that Dalton is the new king of the Sakura Kingdom. Wapol was able to escape his captors.
It was then that Wapol finally realized that he was no longer a king and became deeply depressed. He then became a homeless bum whose only companion was a
dog
that constantly peed on him. He tried to sell matches for a living but was turned down. Eventually Wapol, having nowhere to go, settled under a bridge. Having no money at all to spend for food, all he could afford to eat was the garbage scattered around him.
While eating garbage, strange new toys were inadvertently created by Wapol using his Baku Baku Factory technique. Among these toys, the dog that constantly peed on Wapol apparently got combined with the garbage and had obtained a googly eyed box for a head (hinting that he must have eaten the dog).
These toys eventually attracted children who were fascinated by these toys. Wapol, seeing how these toys attracted children, decided to set up shop and sell these toys for a living.
Eventually Wapol was able to build a proper toy shop with the earnings he got from selling toys. The shop soon in a short time became very popular. It became such a success that the demand for his toys was almost overwhelming, quickly running out of stock and having customers as far as he could see.
Wapol's rise back to power.
Eventually, scientists soon discovered a secret deep within Wapol's toys. It turned out that in the process of creating these toys, Wapol had also created a new type of steel. This steel, which was called
Wapometal
, instantly made headline news and made Wapol an instant celebrity.
With the publicity he gained, Wapol was able to expand his toy shop to great lengths. Soon Wapol had an industry on his hands. He was then able to open up an actual Baku Baku Factory which produced Wapol steel and his toys. This eventually led to the creation of the Wapol Konzern with him as the CEO.
With his wealth and hard work, Wapol was able to marry
Miss Universe
. Together with
Hakowan
his googly-eyed, box-headed dog and wife, Wapol was able to regain his world-famous status and become even more wealthy than when he was a king.

Wano Country Arc
[
]
Wapol and Vivi escape the World Government.
While the Levely was going on, Wapol spied on the meeting between the
Five Elders
and
Nefertari Cobra
through a hole in a wall. Unwittingly, he ended up learning about
Imu
's existence and witnessing Cobra's murder. Realizing the danger in which this knowledge placed him, Wapol immediately began running away through
Pangaea Castle
, destroying walls in his path. During his escape, he broke into a guest room where
Nefertari Vivi
was being held captive by
CP0
. Vivi took this chance to jump into Wapol's mouth and escape with him. The two eventually ran by Wapol's wife Kinderella, who mistakenly thought the two were eloping.
Meanwhile, the other monarchs at the Levely were told to proceed with the meeting despite Wapol and Cobra's absence.
After the Levely ended, both Wapol and Vivi stowed away in the
Eigis Kingdom
's ship. Wapol then contacted the
World Economy News Paper
president
Morgans
and said he had some information for him. Morgans became interested in the fact that Wapol was the subject of a manhunt and agreed to visit the ship under the pretense of a scoop so that Wapol could sneak on board. Vivi then asked Wapol what he saw at the Reverie and requested to use his Den Den Mushi to contact her father. Wapol refused both requests and told her that calling her father was the worst possible thing she could do.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
At some point after meeting with Morgans, Wapol went into hiding alongside Vivi, taking shelter in Morgans' balloon. Wapol showed great anxiety over the possibility of the World Government finding their location, begging Vivi to be quiet so as to not alert any possible
Den Den Mushi
hidden on the balloon.
Later while eavesdropping with Morgans and Vivi on a call from
Egghead
to
Mary Geoise
between
York
and the Five Elders, Wapol was visibly shocked at hearing Luffy speak on the call, holding York hostage and making demands to the Five Elders.
Afterward's the WENP HQ caught wind of Vegapunk's broadcasted message being signaled across the
World
via Marine comms traffic, Wapol silently watched the broadcast along with the other reporters.
Wapol was then surprised to see Vivi covering Morgans' beak to prevent him from interrupting.
As Vegapunk was going to impart a message to the people who bear the
will of D
, Wapol wandered what was he going to say but then the broadcast suddenly stopped.
Following the end of the broadcast, Vivi bickered with Morgans over his plans to create a grim story based on Vegapunk's theories. Upon hearing Morgans threaten to hand Vivi over to the government, Wapol, knowing he was being hunted as well, quickly attempted to get her to apologize, although his pleas fell on deaf ears.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
During the scene where
Dalton
attacks Wapol in the manga, it is shown that Dalton had completely decapitated Wapol. He was able to survive the attack and even move without a head thanks to
Isshi-20
's surgical skills. In the anime, the violent nature of this scene was toned down by showing that Dalton had merely slashed across Wapol's chest instead of slashing off Wapol's head. The part where Wapol's body moved without a reconnected head was also replaced with a nearly identical scene except with Wapol's head fully connected.
Wapol loses his head in the manga.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Name and Epithet
[
]
Due to the fickleness of romanizing katakana, some older fan translations render his name
Vapolu
; the proper romanization was first revealed in
his cover arc
, which depicts it on several of his business letterheads.
His
"Blik"
(
ãƒ–ãƒªã‚­
,
Buriku
?
)
epithet is, properly speaking, a term for any tin-plated material in Japanese.
It is largely if not wholly ignored by both the
4Kids
and
Funimation
anime dubs, while
the Viz manga
renders it as "Wapol
of
Tin".
(Similarly, most English translations adapt the "Bliking" name attached to
his ship
and
his crew
as "Tin Tyrant".)
Other
[
]
As the pun cannot be directly translated, Wapol's habit of calling people "hippos" is omitted from most English versions. The only known attempts to adapt it are
Manga UK
's subtitled version of
the ninth movie
("hippo head") and the English release of
Pirate Warriors 3
("boron").
The 4Kids-dubbed anime depicts him with a Russian accent.
