and a major supporter of
Kurozumi Orochi
.

Kaidou
for her interruption in his fight with
Kouzuki Oden
.
Due of her actions and role, she was a major overarching antagonist in the
Wano Country Arc
and
Saga

Appearance
[
]
Higurashi was an extremely old and decrepit woman with long, wild water green hair and a cleft chin. She had several missing teeth.
Over 41 years ago, during her meeting with
Orochi
, she wore a tattered light kimono and dark pants, and had two lit candles fastened to her forehead with a headband.
25 years ago, after Orochi became the shogun of
Wano Country
, her clothes seem to be well maintained. She is also shown to have
blackened
her teeth.
Due to her
Mane Mane no Mi
abilities, she could alter her physical appearance into a number of individuals, two of whom being
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
and
Oden
.
Personality
[
]
Higurashi believed that those with power decided what was right and wrong, and did not view any attempt to gain power as wrong, even if it involved murder. Thus, she was sympathetic to the
Kurozumi Family
's first attempt to gain the shogunate, and used deceit to help
Orochi
take the title.
Higurashi was very cunning, and would stop at nothing to get what she wants. She was very cautious, having
Orochi
gather funds and weaponry well before his rise to power, knowing the benefits of those markets in the long run. When she saw
Kouzuki Oden
humiliate himself on the street of the
Flower Capital
, she cackled with her family members, enjoying their successes.
In battle, she did not follow any code of honor, as she disguised herself as
Kouzuki Momonosuke
and with the help of a Beasts Pirate member, distracted Oden with a hostage situation so Kaidou could get the upper hand.
However, this came at the cost of her life, as Kaidou was intolerable of foul play in regards to his battles.
Like many other people, she possessed a unique
laughter style
: "Ni kyo kyo kyo kyo"
(
ニキョキョキョキョ
?
)
.
Relationships
[
]
Kurozumi Family
[
]
Being loyal to her family, Higurashi supported Orochi's grandfather and his attempt to seize the shogunate. Higurashi had faith in
Orochi's
ability to bring the Kurozumi Family to power and chose him to carry out her plot.
However, Orochi seemed to care little for her despite her support, as he did not express any concern over Kaidou killing her.
Kouzuki Family
[
]
Higurashi held a grudge against the
Kouzuki Family
for preventing the Kurozumi Family's rise to power years prior, and particularly despised
Sukiyaki
for being born at the time Orochi's grandfather started his takeover attempt.
She laughed when the Kurozumi Family successfully took power and Orochi forced Oden to make a fool of himself in public.
She did not hesitate in using underhanded methods to trick Oden in battle to have him lower his guard.
Kaidou
[
]
Higurashi seemed to be acquainted with
Kaidou
since his
Rocks Pirates
days and approached him 10 years after the
God Valley Incident
with an offer of cooperation. She understood Kaidou's personality well and gained his approval by speaking of the survival of the fittest.
After the two came to an agreement, Higurashi was an ally to Kaidou, and used her power to help him in his fight with Oden.
However, Kaidou was displeased with her for interfering and killed her for it.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Higurashi has proven herself to be an adept strategist, as she instructed Orochi to amass funding and weaponry in order for a successful coup-d'état, which Orochi eventually used the wealth and massive weapons stock to form an alliance with Emperor Kaidou. She also has knowledge of Devil Fruits, considering the isolated country of Wano's limited knowledge, as she knew the power of the one she ate while offering Orochi another.

History
[
]
105 years ago, Higurashi was born in the
Wano Country
.
Several decades before the present, Higurashi had witnessed the
Kurozumi Family
head's unsuccessful attempt to become the next shogun by poisoning his fellow daimyo, and be sentenced to commit seppuku. As the Kurozumi Family lost their status and became targets for persecution, Higurashi left
Wano Country
for a time and according to herself, faced many hardships then. During which, she ate the
Mane Mane no Mi
, giving her the ability to mimic appearance of anyone she meets.
At some point in her travels, she met
Shiki
, and
copied his face
.
She eventually returned to Wano over 41 years ago, where she found
Kurozumi Orochi
, the grandson of the treasonous family leader. She explained to him what had happened with his grandfather, blaming
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
for being born and preventing the Kurozumi Family from taking power. She instructed Orochi to gather up gold and start manufacturing weapons in order to become shogun, offering him the
Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Yamata no Orochi
if he obeyed.
Higurashi visting Kaidou to make a certain proposition.
Between 30 and 33 years ago, Higurashi posed as
Kouzuki Oden
and took Orochi to the shogun's castle, utilizing her disguise to get Orochi a job there. 28 years ago, Higurashi posed as an ailing Sukiyaki, and she decreed that Orochi would be the temporary successor as shogun until Oden returned from his absence.
Around the same time, she traveled to meet
Kaidou
and convinced him to ally with the
Kurozumi Family
in
Wano Country
in exchange for weapons.
25 years ago, Higurashi was with Orochi and
Kurozumi Semimaru
when Oden returned and unsuccessfully attempted to kill Orochi. As Orochi declared that he would remain shogun, Higurashi revealed her ability to impersonate Sukiyaki.
Higurashi, disguised as Momonosuke, distracts Oden long enough for him to be defeated by Kaidou.
Twenty years ago, Higurashi accompanied Orochi and Semimaru to
Kuri
as Orochi told Oden of his intention to build factories there.
Higurashi was present at
Udon
during the battle between Oden's group and the
Beasts Pirates
. After Oden wounded
Kaidou
, Higurashi disguised herself as
Kouzuki Momonosuke
and pretended to be a hostage, distracting Oden so Kaidou could strike him down. After his retainers were defeated, Higurashi revealed her true form to Oden and laughed at his defeat.
However, this action ended up being her downfall, as Kaidou killed her for interfering in his fight with Oden.
Legacy
[

Though Higurashi was executed by Kaido, her interference in Oden's duel against Kaido would lead to all the immense amount of suffering and deaths of countless Wano Citizens particularly the Kouzuki Daimyos and their samurai armies, making her indirectly responsible for the 20 years of tragedies and suffering the Wano Country was forced to endured under Orochi and Kaido's tyranny.
