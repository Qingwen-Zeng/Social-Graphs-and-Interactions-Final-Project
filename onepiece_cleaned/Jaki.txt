Jaki
is a member of the
Numbers
in the
Beasts Pirates
, representing the number "four".
Due to his actions and role, he is a minor antagonist in the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Jaki's concept art from the anime.
As an
artificially-created
ancient giant
, Jaki is immensely bigger than the vast majority of people, although among the Numbers he appears to be relatively short. He has yellow-green skin, a rotund physique with disproportionately short legs and little neck area between his head and torso. He has a wild mane of reddish hair that almost reaches down to the ground. He has a very small round nose and a mouth with large and sharp teeth; his two upper canine teeth are much longer and notably curve to the sides, resembling tusks. He also has a pair of broad, light-colored horns on his head which curve upward like a bull's and point toward each other. The only piece of clothing he appears to wear is a short, raggedy yellow loincloth with a black pattern on it. On the right side of his exposed chest, he has a tattoo of
Daiji
è‚†, which means four.
The color scheme first given to Jaki in the
Vivre Card
databook is completely different from his color scheme in the anime. In the anime, Jaki's skin is pink instead of yellow-green, his hair is blue instead of red, the tips of his horns are dark purple instead of being a solid color with the rest of his skin, and his loincloth is white instead of yellow.
Personality
[
]
Like many of his fellow Numbers, Jaki is a rowdy drunk and was considerably intoxicated when fighting broke out on
Onigashima
. Like the other Numbers, he has a unique laugh that is based on his name: "Jakikiki".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a failed ancient giant creation, Jaki has significant physical power to complement his size, as shown by his ability to wield his massive club as well as carry the
Brachio Tank V
with only one hand. However, he was quickly taken down after being struck in the face by
Franky
's
Radical Beam
.
Weapons
[
]
Jaki wielded a massive spiked club that was even larger than him; the club heavily resembled
Kaidou
's kanabo.
History

Past
[
]
Over 20 years ago, Jaki was a subject in an experiment on
Punk Hazard
that attempted to
recreate
the
ancient giants
. The experiment was a failure, but Jaki and his fellow test subjects were recruited by
Kaidou
. They began residing on
Onigashima
and joined Kaidou's crew, the
Beasts Pirates
, as a group called the
Numbers
.
After the events of the
Legendary Hour
, Jaki was among the pursuers of the
Nine Red Scabbards
, who were escaping from Kaidou's forces following
Kouzuki Oden
's execution. He was able to catch both
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
, who were distracted arguing with each other.
Wano Country Saga

Wano Country Arc
[

Five days before the
Fire Festival
, the Numbers arrived in
Hakumai
via Mogura Harbor and headed toward
Onigashima
with
Scratchmen Apoo
.
Franky attacks Jaki.
During the festivities on the day of the Fire Festival, the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
unleashed a surprise assault on the
Beasts Pirates
. At some point, Jaki,
Juki
, and
Goki
encountered
Usopp
and
Chopper
inside the
Brachio Tank V
, and Jaki easily picked up the contraption. The trio of Numbers then arrived at the
Live Floor
to fight the rebels, and
Franky
fired a
Radical Beam
in Jaki's face to free the Brachio Tank while also defeating Jaki after said attack.
Soon afterwards,
Hatcha
picked up and carried a still-unconscious Jaki while he chased after Franky.
