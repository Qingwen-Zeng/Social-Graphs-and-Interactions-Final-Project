Laskey is a tall man standing around a foot and a half shorter than Spandine who himself is 9 feet. Generally, he looks somewhat similar to Kalifa, which is what led to people correctly suspecting them to be father and daughter. He has flowing gray hair with an antenna jutting out the front, and a small goatee of the same color. Like his daughter, he has a serious and sharp looking face, wears thin-rimmed red sunglasses and blue earrings. He also wears a black suit, like all other

History

Past
[
]
Spandine and his agents arrive at Ohara.
Laskey was born into a family of
assassins
who would father at least two daughters,
Kalifa
and
Alpha
.
He was alongside with the then-CP9 chief,
Spandine
, entering
Ohara
in the
West Blue
under the orders of the
World Government
. They were attempting to stop the
scholars
in Ohara from illegally studying the
Poneglyphs
, and warranted an investigation. However, this was merely an excuse to launch a
Buster Call
against the entire island.
On the island, when confronted by an armed
Nico Olvia
, Laskey and
Kamaya
worked together to strike down the woman. After capturing the archeologists, Spandine then activated the
Golden Den Den Mushi
, and the
Marine battleships
immediately begun to
attack
. As the Buster Call's intensity increased, and the attack happened sooner than the CP9 expected, their chances of escape were drastically reduced.
