"Massacre Soldier" Killer
is a
pirate
from the
South Blue
and a
combatant
of the
Kid Pirates
. He is one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "
Worst Generation
".
After the timeskip, his bounty has been raised from
162,000,000 to
200,000,000.
Following the confrontation with
Kaidou
, Killer ate a defective
SMILE
and took on the alias of
Kamazo the Manslayer
, a street murderer in
Wano Country
who secretly acted as an
assassin
working for the shogun,
Kurozumi Orochi
,
until the shogun discarded him after he had failed his mission to kill
Toko
.
He later reunites with his crew and becomes an ally member of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
during the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Killer is a tall muscular man with fair skin, he has long wild messy blonde hair sticking up in all distance reaching down to his thighs he wears a plain, white and light-blue striped full-head helmet with many rows of holes in it, and what look like modern headphones on both sides. He also wears a black shirt with white polka-dots and an open collar that shows his chest, with blue riding chaps over his ankle-length blue-grey pants. Additionally, Killer has a red sash around his waist.
He carries a pair of handguards which have very long detachable scythes connected to them. When not fighting, these scythes are placed in a green large sheath tied to his right hip.
In an
SBS Volume 64
, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Killer is shown as a boy with shoulder-length wavy hair that covered his eyes with a plain t-shirt, pants and shoes, eating a plate of noodles.
This makes a reference to
SBS Volume 62
, that Oda stated that Killer, as an adult, prefers to consume food that can pass through the holes of his mask, such as stick-shaped ones and ramen.
After the timeskip, Killer is shown as more muscular and with a thicker neck. He has grown a blond goatee and is shown to have a prominent scar (similar to varicose veins.) on his left arm. His hair is shorter, now only reaching down to his back.
He has changed his attire after the two-year timeskip to a blue t-shirt with his customized
Jolly Roger
on. a blue slash, jeans, black dress shoes,
Under the guise as Kamazo the Manslayer, Killer lost his mask and has bandages covering most of his face and arms. He has sharp, slanted eyes with blue pupils and purple-coloured lips. His hair is kept bound into a high ponytail, and he wears a red violet kimono with yellow sickle-shaped patterns placed on it irregularly, as well as a dark violet obi around his waist and a cape that both have target patterns on them.
By the time of the Fire Festival, Killer regained his mask, although it was heavily damaged during his fight with Hawkins, having received several cracks.

Personality
[
]
Like the rest of Kid's crew, Killer comes across as both mildly arrogant and level-headed, in the latter case, probably more so than their captain. Of course, this does not mean he is not as enticed toward violence as anybody else on the crew. He also remains fairly silent during combat, save for the slicing of his blades, and tends to focus on the elimination of his enemies.
Killer is more knowledgeable than his captain in terms of historical facts, as shown when he informed Kid the meaning of the
Ox Bell
.
After the timeskip, Killer has been shown to be much calmer than his captain, advising him to be polite when meeting with his fellow Supernovas, and was then able to prevent a fight between him and
Scratchmen Apoo
from escalating while reminding them of the purpose of their meeting. He also seems to be more reasonable than his captain, which is in contrast to his name, as he tried to reason things out rather than immediately trying to start a fight.
"Kamazo" sheds tears through his smile.
Killer is very caring towards his allies. Though the exact terms are unknown, he was made an offer where he could save his crew by eating a SMILE fruit and working for Orochi, and Killer accepted the deal. After eating a faulty SMILE fruit, Killer lost the ability to express negative emotions and is now only able to smile and laugh.
After taking on the alias Kamazo, he displays the traits of a violent man who takes pleasure in killing. If he encounters someone whom he has not been ordered to kill, he will give them the chance to get out of his way but will kill anyone who stands between him and his target without issue. He is very confident in his abilities, constantly taunting his opponents and being sure that they will lose to him. As someone who worked for Orochi, "Kamazo" held the shogun in high regard and would get mad if anyone referred to the shogun in an impolite manner.
By the time of the raid on
Onigashima
, Killer started regaining much of his former personality, though he still suffers from the effect of the faulty SMILE fruit. A week after the raid, Killer expresses admiration at
General Franky
, continuing a running gag that male characters often partake in when they see robots.
Like many other people, he has a unique
laughter style
: "Faffaffaffa"
(
ファッファッファッファ
?
)
.
According to Kid, Killer hates his own laugh to the point of stopping himself from doing so ever since. Moreover, he also hates people laughing at his laugh and is willing to kill them for it.
His favorite food is spaghetti, his mask being specially designed so he can eat it without removing the mask.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Like his
Captain
, the
Kid Pirates
seem to have the most respect for him after Kid. After eating a defective
SMILE
and losing the ability to express negative emotions, the crew also laughed like Killer out of respect for his new condition and knowing that he hates his own laugh.
Eustass Kid
[
]
Kid and Killer Drowning.
Kid and Killer grew up together, so they share a close bond that goes all the way back to childhood.
Kid refers to Killer as his partner and is aware that the latter is sensitive about his own strange laugh, which is why, despite being unaware about Killer having eaten a defective
SMILE
, he knew something was wrong with his subordinate. This was enough for Kid to attempt a reckless rescue of his friend, which led to his second capture from the
Beasts Pirates
after managing to escape the first time.
Killer has displayed immense loyalty for Kid multiple times; it was due to Kid's life being in danger that Killer ate a defective SMILE fruit and became a subordinate of
Kurozumi Orochi
, showcasing extreme loyalty for Kid.
Another notable instance of this happened during the war against the Beasts Pirates at
Onigashima
, when Hawkins managed to link his life to Kid's, which forced Killer on the defensive so he would not accidentally kill his captain, even begging Hawkins to take his life instead as long as he left Kid's alone.
Killer usually acts as the voice of reason for his captain, making sure Kid stays focused and does not lose sight of his goals due to impulsiveness, especially if it was about achieving your
goal
. Killer also provides Kid with useful information whenever the latter displays curiosity in a certain topic.
Enemies
[
]
Basil Hawkins
[

During the meeting between the
Hawkins Pirates
, the
Kid Pirates
and the
On Air Pirates
to form an alliance, Killer tried to reach for Hawkins so he would not leave before hearing their proposal, showing he was interested in having the Magician on his side.
That said, Hawkins submitted to Kaidou when the latter attacked the hideout of the Kid Pirates, eventually becoming their enemy in the
Wano Country Arc
.
Hawkins confronted Killer during the
raid on Onigashima
and where Killer taunted him for being a true watchdog of Kaidou, feeling confident that he would win.
Using Kid's life as a hostage, Hawkins managed to get the upper hand in the battle despite Killer's efforts. However, Killer was able to figure out a way to bypass the effects of the
Wara Wara no Mi
, something Hawkins could not foresee. Killer claimed that Hawkins was unsure about his loyalty to Kaidou and regretted joining forces with the Emperor. He also taunted his former ally about his choice to become part of the Beasts Pirates, citing that, despite Hawkins' predictions, he and Kid were still alive from their previous fight with Kaidou.
Rivals
[
]
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
Killer and
Roronoa Zoro
first met in
Wano Country
when Zoro fought off Killer—who was working under the alias "Kamazo"—to protect
Hiyori
and
Toko
.
During the
raid on Onigashima
, Zoro recognized Killer as Kamazo due to his laugh. Killer claimed that if he had used his Punishers, the outcome of their fight would have been different to which Zoro responded that the outcome would just end the same. It is shown to be well connected when they attacked Kaidou
and when they were going to rob Big Mom's homies.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Killer effortlessly defeating Marines.
As a member of the
Worst Generation
, he is a powerful pirate, being the only one (alongside Roronoa Zoro), not to be a captain; where along with him he is also one of the two members who does not have the powers of a
Devil Fruit
, unlike everyone else.
Prior to the timeskip, he obtained a bounty of a
162,000,000 by the time he had reached the
Sabaody Archipelago
, where he briefly faced off against
Urouge
, another member of the Worst Generation, with apparent ease.
After the time skip, his abilities have increased, where his bounty increased to
200,000,000.
He was able to face Zoro, where the latter recognized Killer's power. At the same time, he managed to wound him, albeit with a surprise attack, only to be defeated in the end.
Killer himself believed that he could have killed Zoro if he had used his Punishers. During the
raid on Onigashima
, he earned the distinction of injuring
Kaidou
, formerly of the
Four Emperors
and considered the "The Strongest Creature", where Kaidou himself recognized his power.
He later defeated to
Basil Hawkins
, another Worst Generation member, where the latter seemed to recognize he could not defeat Killer, so he decided to use dirty tricks.
Additionally, Killer has a strong will, as he was completely unaffected by a burst of
Rayleigh
's
Supreme King Haki
.
After eating a failed
SMILE
, Killer lost his ability to swim and to show other expressions besides a smile.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Killer's style of fighting seems to rely mainly on his extraordinary speed and agility, which he uses to overpower his opponents before they can strike him or dodge his attacks. Killer's fighting style tends to be highly acrobatic as a result and he is able to slice targets before being noticed or detected.
During his battle with Zoro, he managed to put him in constant trouble in terms of speed,
and he was even able to steal
Napoleon
from Emperor
Big Mom
's clutches before she could realize it.
Killer possesses immense physical strength, being capable of fighting head on with
Urouge
, a man twice his size.
He has incredible levels of physical endurance and stamina, being able to continue fighting after a lightning strike from
Zeus
, one of Big Mom's most powerful homies.

Weapons
[
]
Further information:
Punishers
Killer using his Punishers.
Killer is seen wielding a pair of gauntlets equipped with scythe-like blades, which he dubs "Punishers". The blades are capable of spinning around like buzzsaws or simply being used as hand scythes. These weapons can also be used to block other weapons, leaving the foe open for Killer to kick the enemy's flank or other exposed areas. This, combined with the agility he has so far displayed in combat and the notion that he is not afraid to kill, makes him a formidable foe.
If spun at a high enough speed, the Punishers can generate powerful soundwaves to inflict damage to its target from the inside.
This way, Killer even managed to hurt
Kaidou
, in his full
dragon form
, a feat only a few people were capable of, let alone dared to.
In the anime, the Punishers were destroyed when Killer attempted to block
Shanks
' attack at
Elbaph
,
while their fate is unknown in the manga.
As Kamazo, Killer used two regular scythes, but lost them after he was defeated by Zoro.
In the anime, Killer was shown able to launch flying slash attacks with both sets of weapons.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Killer was born in the
South Blue
in an island unaffiliated with the
World Government
.
He knew
Eustass Kid
since they were children. One day, they ate curry udon with their first love,
Victoria Shiruton Doruyanaika
. They laughed when she spilled curry broth all over herself while eating it, causing her to beat them up. This caused curry udon to become their least favorite food.
According to Kid, Killer hated his own laugh so much that he beat up anyone who made fun of it. He eventually stopped laughing at all and started to wear a mask to hide his face.
Killer, Kid,
Heat
and
Wire
were bosses of gangs ruling the island's four towns. After Victoria was murdered by a rival gang, Kid unified the four groups and took down the rival gang. He then decided to form
a pirate crew
, naming their ship
Victoria Punk
after Victoria, with Kid as the
captain
and Killer as his right-hand man.
While his captain gained more and more infamy, Killer himself became well known as well, earning himself a
162,000,000 bounty alongside his captain. They were noted to have been responsible for a great deal of damage and had caused many civilian casualties for the slightest provocations along their journey.
They eventually entered the
Grand Line
in search of the
One Piece
. After a long voyage following one of the
Log Pose
routes of the Grand Line, Killer and the crew arrived at the
Sabaody Archipelago
to prepare themselves for the
New World
.

Killer having his fight with Urouge interrupted by Drake.
After a long voyage following one of the
Log Pose
routes of the
Grand Line
, Kid and his crew came to the
Sabaody Archipelago
to prepare themselves for the
New World
. For unknown reasons, he ended up facing
Urouge
around one of the archipelago's groves. Killer's fight was eventually broken up by
X Drake
, who told them to reign in themselves until they hit the
New World
.
He later rejoined with his captain at the
Human Auctioning House
, to observe the auction taking place. After interruptions caused by
Monkey D. Luffy
, Killer found himself fighting to escape alongside
Trafalgar Law
's and Luffy's crews, in the face of a daunting
Marine
attack.
During the battle, Luffy remarked how he will be the one to find the great
treasure
One Piece
; Kid responded to this statement by ceasing current fighting, and facing Luffy. After a brief recollection between the captains, on how their journey was met with laughter and dismissal at their crews' dreams, on their route along the Grand Line, the crew escaped together.

The crew managed to defeat the Marines and headed back to their ship to escape the island. Destroying a bridge to halt enemy progress, their crew was amazed at the tenacity shown by the Marines, as they continued the chase despite the bridge being destroyed. Their attention was drawn at that moment, however, to the presence of a
Pacifista
, whom they assumed to be
Warlord of the Sea
Bartholomew Kuma
. With the Heart Pirates eventually joining in, both crews prepared themselves to confront the human weapon.
Marineford Arc
[
]
The Kid Pirates managed to escape capture by the Pacifista and later were seen somewhere in the Sabaody Archipelago. They watched the live broadcast of the execution of
Portgas D. Ace
up until it was cut off by the Marines.
Post-War Arc
[
]
The Kid Pirates then approached Marineford and watched the war unfold from a safe distance on board of their ship.
Kid Pirates defeat Haritsu Kendiyo.
Several weeks after the war, Killer and the rest of the Kid Pirates were on a rainy island in the
New World
. When Kid read the
newspaper
about Luffy ringing the
Ox Bell
and asked about it, Killer explained the significance to his captain.
They had taken another pirate crew captive. After the crew begged Kid to let them go back to "Paradise" (the first half of the Grand Line), Kid tied them to branches in the shapes of different crosses and crucified them using his Devil Fruit powers, saying that people with that little amount of resolve have no business in the New World.
During the Timeskip
[
]
During the timeskip, Killer's bounty was increased to
200,000,000. At some point, the crew engaged in a battle against the
Red Hair Pirates
.
Sometime later, the crew arrived in
Totto Land
, where they retreated after forcing one of Big Mom's
Sweet Commanders
to give them a copy of her
Road Poneglyph
.
Dressrosa Saga

Killer and Kid watched
Caesar Clown
's broadcast of his new
weapon of mass destruction
via a video
Den Den Mushi
, and Killer commented on how his captain was not suited to be a
broker
. Leading Kid away to one of the main rooms, he warned the other to be civil before entering the room. Discovering the place, a mess due to
Scratchmen Apoo
looking for an alleged sniper, Kid quickly started a fight with Apoo, while
Basil Hawkins
decided to leave. Calming the others down, Killer then revealed their intention to create an alliance with the
On Air
and
Hawkins
pirates.
Later on, he continued watching Caesar's video broadcast, where Luffy defeated Caesar.
The next morning, the newspaper printed a story which announced the alliance between the three crews. The group was confused on how the information got out but put the issue aside, as they were planning to take down an
Emperor
.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Kid Pirates find themselves facing Kaidou.
Kid, Hawkins, and Apoo were dining together when they heard the news of
Doflamingo
's defeat. They figured that Luffy and Law were after
Kaidou
. Killer revealed that the target of the Kid's alliance is
Shanks
.
A mysterious figure then landed on the Kid Pirates' base, and when it got up, Killer wondered in shock what kind of monster it was before the figure revealed himself to be Kaidou.
At that time, Killer, Kid, and Hawkins discovered that Apoo was already working for Kaidou with the intention of setting them up to join Kaidou as
his subordinates
. While Hawkins joined Kaidou, Killer and Kid refused to submit to the Emperor and tried to fight him only to be defeated. Afterwards, the Kid Pirates were separated.

At some point after the encounter with Kaidou,
Kurozumi Orochi
offered Killer a chance to save his captain by giving him a
SMILE
fruit, but the fruit was a failure and it stripped Killer of his ability to express his emotions except happiness, which angered Killer (partly due to how much he hates his own laugh).
Later Orochi hired him as an assassin under his orders, taking the name "Kamazo".

Delta Island
. He participated in the main event, the Treasure Race, safely sailing up the
Knock Up Stream
and landing on the central Treasure Island, where all the pirates raced for
Gol D. Roger
's treasure, all the while battling other Worst Generation members. When
Buggy
ended up exposing himself after snatching the treasure, Killer and his crew chased after the Warlord. However, the Treasure Race was cut short, when someone threw a galleon at the island, destroying it, and sending everything plummeting back to the surface. When Killer realized that the one who did this was
Douglas Bullet
, he notified Kid, who was quite surprised. In the end, after his captain gave into Bullet's taunting, he and the other Worst Generation members (except for Zoro and Law) attacked the Demon Heir. At first the Worst Generation pirates managed to deal a few good blows on the veteran, but when the opponent revealed his
Gasha Gasha no Mi
powers, the battle quickly ended in their defeat.
Later, after Bullet was defeated, his crew along with the other Worst Generation pirates and several other crews attempted to break through the
Marines
encirclement surrounding the island. They were able to successfully escape thanks to
Sabo
and
Ann
creating a blazing barrier to protect them.

According to a Wano newspaper, he was responsible for a street murder on the eighth street in District 2 of the
Flower Capital
.
Zoro defeats Kamazo.
After the chaos at the palace, Orochi hired Kamazo to kill the kamuro
Toko
. He then pursued Toko and
Kouzuki Hiyori
to the Ringo region, where he came across a confrontation between
Roronoa Zoro
and
Gyukimaru
. Zoro then clashed with Killer in order to protect Toko and Hiyori. When Zoro was distracted by Gyukimaru, Killer managed to land a grievous hit on him. However, Zoro was able to take one of his scythes as a result and strike him.
After that blow, Killer fell to the ground defeated.
Killer and Kid undergo water torture.
Later on, for failing to kill Toko, he was sent to the
Prisoner Mine
in
Udon
alongside Kid, who previously escaped and got recaptured. Kid questioned him on what Kaidou had done to him and the fate of their crew, but Kamazo could not answer through his laughter and tears.
Queen
then subjected them both to water torture and threatened to keep them submerged until Luffy and
Hyougoro
die.
When Big Mom was swinging Queen around, Killer and Kid were saved from drowning when Queen crashed into the contraption holding them and knocked them out of the water.
As Luffy and his allies from the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
were fighting against the Beasts Pirates,
Raizo
tossed some keys to Killer and Kid, which they used to escape their cuffs.
After the prison takeover, Kid rejected Luffy's offer for an alliance and Killer left the Prisoner Mines with Kid.
Killer and Kid later reunited with their crewmates and joined the battle against the Beasts Pirates during the
Fire Festival
, with Killer having regained his original identity and look at some point.
When the Straw Hats took over the port in front of
Onigashima
, the Kid Pirates promised to be the ones who would defeat Kaidou, all while laughing with Killer out of respect for his new condition.
After disembarking on Onigashima, the Kid Pirates received Beasts Pirates disguises from
Kin'emon
.
As the alliance began their raid, the Kid Pirates went ahead of the Straw Hats.
While deep inside Onigashima, the Kid Pirates overheard the commotion caused by Luffy and Zoro and attempted to remain incognito, but when their former ally Apoo started getting involved, Killer was unable to hold Kid back.
Killer assisting Kid with metal gathering.
After Kid's brief scuffle with Apoo, the situation became more chaotic as a Number entered the fray. As Killer, Kid, Luffy, and Zoro ran to the castle, Killer told the others a possible way to avoid Apoo's attacks.
Inside the castle, Killer and Kid got separated from their allies and found themselves fighting against several Gifters.
As the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance began their all-out war on the Beasts Pirates, Killer and Kid were aided by some of the rebels who had infiltrated the castle.
Killer and Kid eventually reached the third level of the castle, where Killer cut through opponents as Kid focused on collecting metal.
Killer and the other Supernovas face Kaidou and Big Mom.
The two later reached the roof, where they were joined by Law, Zoro, and Luffy as they prepared to fight against Kaidou and Big Mom.
When watching Luffy successfully deal damage to Kaidou with his improved Armament Haki at the opening clash of the battle, Killer mentioned that they actually do have a chance of winning. Later and after a brief discussion with Zoro about their fight back in Ringo and how the outcome would have been different if Killer was using his
Punishers
, they both attacked Kaidou simultaneously, with the Emperor praising their combat skills.
As the battle went on, Killer tried attacking Kaidou with
Kamaa Sonic
in order to injure his internals and was successful to some extent. However, Killer was struck by a lightning bolt unleashed by Big Mom right afterwards. While Killer was falling, Kaidou tried to chomp on him, but Luffy was able to kick Kaidou away.
After Luffy pummeled Kaidou with Gomu Gomu no Kong Gatling, Killer and Kid tried to continue on the offensive, but Kaidou stopped them by creating some twisters. Killer is then shocked to see that Zoro managed to hurt Kaido by penetrating his scales. The emperor thus launches several air cuts from which Killer defends himself using his weapons.
Having trouble facing the combined might of Kaidou and Big Mom, the Supernovas devised a plan to split the two Emperors away from each other.
Kaido and Big Mom use a combo attack, which Zoro manages to slow down allowing the others to avoid it, after Killer asks the others where the Straw Hat is, Killer and Zoro separated Big Mom from her special
homies
, with Killer knocking
Napoleon
out of her hand and chasing away the sword.
After Kid and Law trapped
Zeus
in a box and threw Big Mom off the island, Killer accompanied his captain to the edge of Onigashima in order to prevent her from returning.
Big Mom flew back to Onigashima with a
new thundercloud homie
and attacked Killer and Kid. The lightning bolt sent them crashing back inside the
Skull Dome
. When Big Mom searched for them in the floor below, they chased after her to prevent her from rejoining Kaidou.
Their former ally, Hawkins blocked their path, so Killer told Kid to proceed while he took care of Hawkins himself. Hawkins transforms into a straw monster, thanking Killer, since his chances of beating both of them were very low, so Killer mocks him back. Hawkins started taunting Killer about the latter's chances of dying in this fight, which were a staggering 92%, but Killer brushed off Hawkins' fortune-telling, laughing it off while showing reassurance of his own strength.
Killer continues to attack Hawkins, depriving him of many of his dolls, asking him how many he has left, to which Hawkins replied that he is running out. Killer then stabbed Hawkins, who redirected the injury to a doll linked to Kid. Hawkins revealed the truth about the link because he wanted to watch Killer struggle with killing his captain, at which Killer laughed at his mercilessness.
Killer cuts Hawkins down.
Hawkins hits a pillar to injure Kidd even though Killer, who is lying on the ground, yells at him to stop, where Hawkins taunts his condition for the Smiley, while Killer tells his teammates not to go. When Killer offers his life in exchange for the Kid, Hawkins violently kicks him, taunting that now that the Kid is finally fighting an emperor, there is no need to intervene. In addition to telling him that if he wanted to, he could cut him off now, while if he agrees to surrender, he could make Kaido forgive him. Hawkins tells him that there is no point in continuing to fight, and he and his allies will have no chance of defeating the emperors. Killer, however, countered that Hawkins was covering up his own regret for siding with Kaidou due to how the alliance had fought against the intended results, to which Hawkins angrily tells him that in the end it will be decided who was right.
Killer gets up saying that he has no regrets, as well as asking Hawkins to explain his power again. Killer then cut off Hawkins' left arm because it wouldn't affect Kid since he no longer had one, where he removed the last straw dummy from Hawkins' amputated arm. Hawkins then uses his cards to summon the Straw Man from him, but Killer decapitated him and quickly defeated Hawkins. Afterwards, Killer cheered on Kid to win in his fight with Big Mom.
When the castle was engulfed in flames, some of Killer's companions started carrying him around under his protest. At that point they were hit by an immense amount of water, realizing that they were safe.
As Onigashima finally lands, he and Kid hear
Nekomamushi
announce that Luffy has finally defeated Kaido and that
Momonosuke
has facilitated the fall of the island.
Killer celebrates Wano's victory with his crew.
One week later, in the port of Tokage, Killer and the other members of the Kid Pirates oversaw the repair of their ship, the
Victoria Punk
, with the aid of
Franky
,
Usopp
and
Minatomo
, with Killer showing admiration for the
General Franky
. Kid warned his subordinates to stop being so friendly with the Straw Hats. As the pirates began discussing potential bounties, Apoo arrived with a
newspaper
containing Kid's new bounty and information about who had replaced Kaidou and Big Mom in the
Four Emperors
.
Killer correctly guessed that Kid was displeased with the news and had rushed to the
Flower Capital
to confront Luffy about it. He then took the opportunity to call his crewmembers to the festival happening at town in order to celebrate their win.
A few days later, as the Kid Pirates were readying themselves for departure, Law gave the Kid Pirates a copy of Wano's Road Poneglyph. Recognizing that it was like the one they took from the Big Mom Pirates, Killer remarked that they had to get serious in the race for
One Piece
, specifically by going after
Hinokizu
.
As the three crews departed from Wano, the ships all went down the Climbing Koi Waterfall.
Final Saga

Egghead Arc

Following the sea route their captain chose back at Wano, the Kid Pirates eventually reached their next destination,
Elbaph
. Killer woke Kid and questioned if they should disembark due to the danger of the island.
Shortly after their arrival, they encountered the
Giant Warrior Pirates
, the
Red Hair Pirates
, and the captains allied with the Red Hair Pirates, thus prompting the crew to prepare for battle.
Killer warned his captain about underestimating the other captains because he recognized some of them from bounty posters. Killer then informed him that there were nine ships, so Kid prepared to destroy them all with Damned Punk. When Shanks leapt to attack Kid directly, Killer jumped in to protect his captain. Shanks'
Kamusari
destroyed the railgun and heavily injured Killer and Kid in the process. As Shanks left the Victoria Punk,
Dorry
and
Broggy
's Hakoku split the ship in half, and the crew sank with the it.
