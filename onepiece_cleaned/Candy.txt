CP9's Independent Report
[
]
Lucci shows excessive justice against the Candy Pirates.
Candy led his crew and docked at
St. Poplar
's harbor. He then ordered his crew to raid the town, terrorizing the townspeople.
Unfortunately for them,
CP9
had arrived in town after having escaped from
Enies Lobby
. Upon hearing reports of trouble happening, the former CP9 agents arrived at the harbor to see what was causing the problem. Candy was walking around carefree when Lucci immediately attacked him
and knocked him unconscious. Then the other former CP9 agents fought and defeated Candy's crew.
However, even after Candy had passed out, Lucci continued to display "
excessive justice
" against the defeated pirate captain by stepping on his skull, which horrified the townspeople.
Afterwards, Candy and his crew were left bloodied in the streets as CP9 decided to leave the town.
