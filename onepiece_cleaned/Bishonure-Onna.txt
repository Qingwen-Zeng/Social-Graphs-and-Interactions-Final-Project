Wano Country Arc
[
]
Brook defeats Bishonure-Onna and the others.
After
Black Maria
captured
Sanji
, Bishonure-Onna and her comrades chased him until he fell, surrounding him.
She watched as Maria battered him and demanded he call out for
Nico Robin
, and was shocked when he did so. She was equally shocked when Robin and
Brook
arrived almost immediately, and watched as Robin attacked Maria and Brook rescued Sanji.
The Beasts Pirates attempted to use a hallucinogenic fog on the two Straw Hats, but when it failed, Bishonure-Onna and a few of Maria's subordinates attempted to chase them down. Once Maria joined the chase, her and Robin began fighting in earnest, while Maria's subordinates were held off by Brook.
After he made a wall of ice between them and Maria, she heard a scream from the other side, and peeked through a crack to see Maria defeated and Robin standing over her. With the Gifters all lined up to peek through, they were defeated by Brook in a single attack.
