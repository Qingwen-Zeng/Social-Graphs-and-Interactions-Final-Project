Whole Cake Island Arc
[

The Noble Croc encounters the Sanji retrieval team.
The Noble Croc was swimming through a river in the Seducing Woods when the Sanji retrieval team entered the woods. As they crossed a bridge, the Noble Croc leaped out and tried to eat them, but the team managed to dodge his attack. Upon seeing that most of them were humans, Noble Croc decided not to eat them and departed.
Later, the Noble Croc was with
Charlotte Brûlée
and several other of her henchmen in her house in the Mirro-World as she prepared to cook
Carrot
in a soup.
The Noble Croc is defeated by Chopper.
The hungry crocodile looked forward to trying mink, but Carrot and
Tony Tony Chopper
managed to escape from their confinements. Chopper then snuck up behind Noble Croc and activated
Monster Point
before grabbing him by the tail and flipping him over, crushing Brûlée's henchmen underneath him and leaving them all defeated.
