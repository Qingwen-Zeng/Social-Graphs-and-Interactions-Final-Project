from
Elbaph
and a member of the
Giant Warrior Pirates

Dorry
and
Brogy
.
After being captured by the
Marines
50 years ago, he and his comrade
Kashii
were tricked into serving as the guards of
Enies Lobby
's main gate. During the
Enies Lobby Arc
, Oimo and Kashii defected against the World Government and allied themselves with the
Straw Hat Pirates
,
Galley-La Company

Franky Family
.
During the
Egghead Arc
, Oimo and Kashii became major allies of the Straw Hat Pirates as members of the Giant Warrior Pirates.
Appearance
[
]
Oimo is a thickset giant with a flat, pig-like nose and long, flowing orange hair, along with some stubble on his chin. He sports viking attire, with a light green short-sleeved shirt lined in brown-green. He also wears tab suspenders with large gold buttons, and a big pink tunic with brown lace lined on the top with a lighter colored fluff. Under that, he sports green-brown pants with big black boots. He is seen wearing a Roman style helmet, with gold around the edges and red in the middle, with pink frills on the top. He has a big black belt with a gold buckle, and is usually seen with his gargantuan wooden club.
Sixty-three years ago, Oimo had less girth and wore a brown hat with flaps on the sides.
Personality
[
]
Oimo has shown himself to be devoted to serving and helping his comrades and allies. Oimo does not take kindly to enemies threatening his friends or mocking him, but his rage can cause him to act rashly, such as when he tried to hit the Franky Family standing on Kashii's body and ended up striking Kashii instead.
Oimo was even willing to devote 100 years of his life to working for the World Government just to save his two captains from imprisonment, and when he thought he had failed in this duty, he wept bitterly.
After allying with the Franky Family and Galley-La Company, Oimo and Kashii were even willing to risk themselves for them, as shown when they took the brunt of the
Buster Call
's fire to keep their allies out of harm's way.
Oimo is very confident in his power as a giant and has no issue with using excessive force against smaller opponents. He takes the pride and customs of Elbaph extremely seriously, viewing Dorry and Brogy's duel to the death as natural and nearly becoming very angry at Usopp when briefly under the impression that the pirate was mocking the giants' pride.
Like Kashii, Oimo does not take kindly to being deceived, and so immediately turned against the World Government after finding out they had lied to put them in service.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Kashii
[
]
Oimo and Kashii have never been seen apart and have worked together as comrades for over 100 years. The two of them frequently converse when working and are shown to work together in combat very well. Oimo was very angry when the Franky Family managed to subdue Kashii, and was aghast when he accidentally struck and knocked out his comrade.
Dorry and Brogy
[
]
Oimo has the utmost respect for his captains Dorry and Brogy, and although he left them to duel to the death as Elbaph tradition dictated, he and Kashii eventually became concerned for their captains' safety after neither one had returned to Elbaph in 50 years and so set out to find them. After being tricked by the World Government into believing that Dorry and Brogy were being held in prison, Oimo and Kashii readily agreed to serve at Enies Lobby for 100 years in order to free them.
After learning that Dorry and Brogy were actually still at large, Oimo and Kashii were very relieved and intended to celebrate after leaving Enies Lobby.
Since Usopp informed them that Dorry and Brogy were continuing to duel, Oimo and Kashii ceased looking for them.
Enemies
[
]
World Government
[
]
As a member of the Giant Warrior Pirates, Oimo became an enemy of the World Government and Marines, and so they captured him and Kashii upon encountering them at sea. Wanting the two giants' tremendous strength, the World Government lied that they had captured Dorry and Brogy and successfully got Oimo and Kashii to serve as guards at Enies Lobby. The duo did not suspect any deception until
Usopp
exposed the lie by revealing that he had met Dorry and Brogy at
Little Garden
.
This made Oimo and Kashii extremely angry at the World Government, and they immediately began working with the forces invading Enies Lobby and rampaged against any Marine or guard standing in their way.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a giant from Elbaph and a former member of the Giant Warrior Pirates, Oimo is a very powerful warrior. Together with Kashii, he guarded the main gate to Enies Lobby without fail for 50 years. Oimo and Kashii were able to quickly overwhelm the
Franky Family
and
Galley-La Company
when they invaded Enies Lobby, although they were ultimately overpowered by the invaders' strategy and teamwork.
After defecting against the World Government, Oimo and Kashii quickly became a fearsome threat against the legions of guards and soldiers in Enies Lobby,
although they were eventually subdued by the guards' vast numbers and tied up.
Oimo and Kashii have a notable degree of seafaring skill, as they were able to navigate the treacherous
New World
on their way to find Dorry and Brogy, although they ended up being captured by the Marines.
Physical Abilities
[
]
As a giant, Oimo possesses immense physical strength. He and Kashii showed themselves to be vastly superior to the
Kairiki Destroyers
, a trio of large humans, by defeating each of them with a single attack.
When attacking the World Government forces at Enies Lobby, Oimo used his vast frame to his advantage to quickly overpower the opponents around him.
Oimo was shown ripping off part of a building with no effort during his rampage,
and later he was able to carry the gigantic King Bull
Sodom
on his shoulder along with many Galley-La and Franky Family members who were on Sodom's back.
Oimo possesses a tremendous level of durability. Although he fainted after being rapidly spun around, he very quickly regained consciousness. He then proceeded to be struck in the back by
Rocketman
, a high-speed runaway train with a front section resembling a drill; he regained consciousness soon after this attack as well, and although the train left a noticeable dent in the skin on his back, he was not shown to have been impaled by it.
Later, Oimo was hit by an extremely powerful cannonball barrage from a
Buster Call
fleet with the firepower to destroy an entire island, but he was shown to be conscious afterwards.
Attacks
[
]
Oimo Press
(
オイモプレス
,
Oimo Puressu
?
)
: Oimo jumps belly-first onto his target, capable of crushing a large crowd of people under his immense weight. This was first seen used against a legion of guards at Enies Lobby.
Weapons
[
]
Oimo wields a very large wooden club with metal studs. He uses this in conjunction with his natural strength to strike enemies with immense force, and was even able to knock his fellow giant Kashii unconscious after accidentally striking him in the face with the club.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Oimo and the rest of the crew leaving their captains on Little Garden.
Over 100 years ago, Oimo sailed with the
Giant Warrior Pirates
and rampaged across the world. However, his captains
Dorry
and
Brogy
began dueling after having a disagreement, and the rest of the crew decided to dissolve and return to their homeland of
Elbaph
, where they waited for the winner of the duel to return. However, many years passed and neither captain returned.
38 years after the crew's dissolution, Oimo's former crewmate
Kashii
voiced his concern about their captains, and Oimo said they should wait 10 more years before going to find them.
50 years after the crew's dissolution, Oimo and Kashii decided to set out to sea and find their captains. However, they were captured by the
Marines
, and after being interrogated, they were told that Dorry and Brogy had been captured and were being held in a large prison. The
World Government
offered to free Dorry and Brogy if Oimo and Kashii guarded the gate to
Enies Lobby
for the next 100 years, and the duo agreed to this.
Oimo and Kashii twenty-two years before the start of the series.
Twenty-two years before the start of the series, Oimo and Kashii heard the news that the Pirate King
Gol D. Roger
had been executed. Kashii believed that there would be more pirates in the future, but Oimo was confident that they would not attack Enies Lobby.
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
When invading forces from the
Franky Family
broke through the Main Gate, Oimo and Kashii quickly woke up and leaped over the wall to confront them.
The large
Kairiki Destroyers
moved to attack the two giants, but Oimo and Kashii immediately overpowered and defeated them. As the duo began battling the rest of the Franky Family, reinforcements from the
Galley-La Company
came in and managed to overpower Kashii with their tools and weapons. Oimo was shocked to see this and, in a fit of anger, tried striking them with his club, but instead hit Kashii right in the face and knocked him out.
Franky Family vs. Oimo.
Oimo started attacking the invaders, but
Mozu and Kiwi
then announced that they had unlocked the Main Gate. As Oimo turned to attack them,
Paulie
used
Rope Action
to instantly wrap a rope around the giant's entire body. The King Bulls
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
then grabbed onto the end of the rope and spun Oimo around while they charged into the gate to open it. When the gate was opened, Oimo fell onto the ground and briefly fainted. He quickly regained consciousness and stood up to begin attacking again, but was then suddenly struck in the back by the flying runaway
Sea Train
Rocketman
, knocking him out once again.
After regaining consciousness, Oimo remained on the ground and started weeping as he believed that Dorry and Brogy would remain imprisoned now that he and Kashii had failed in their duty. The pirate
Usopp
then came to him and asked if he was really from Elbaph. Oimo decided to tell him about how he and Kashii started working for the World Government in order to free their captains from imprisonment, but Usopp then revealed that he had met Dorry and Brogy and that the World Government had lied about capturing them.
Oimo believed Usopp, and when Kashii got back up and rejoined him, the duo began rampaging through Enies Lobby and attacking the World Government forces to punish them for their deception.
The guards were powerless to put a stop to the giants' rampaging, and some of the Galley-La members started riding with Usopp on the duo's shoulders as Usopp told them to head toward the Courthouse.
Oimo and Kashii quickly reached the Courthouse, and noted how the giant frog
Yokozuna
had valiantly kept the guards at bay before they got there.
They then started attacking the guards to keep them out of the Courthouse, and quickly gained the upper hand.
However, the guards were eventually able to overwhelm the giants and invaders and tie them up. From outside the Courthouse, they then heard
Spandam
speaking over the intercom about how he had called in a
Buster Call
on Enies Lobby.
The giants help the Franky Family and Galley-La foremen escape.
The guards immediately fled to escape the island before it was destroyed, and the giants and invaders were able to break free of their ropes. Oimo and Kashii ran toward the front gate, carrying the injured Sodom and Gomorrah as well as the Franky Family and Galley-La fighters.
The group then saw the Tower of Justice being hit with a cannon blast as the Buster Call's bombardment began.
The group eventually made it out of the Main Gate, but found themselves confronted by three massive Marine battleships. The battleships then opened fire on the main island, and Oimo and Kashii took the brunt of the bombardment as they and their allies were sent plummeting into the bottomless pit below the island.
However, since the Galley-La workers were kept out of harm's way, Paulie managed to use Rope Action to keep the group attached to the side of the island. Oimo was held to the cliff by his ankles, and commented that blood was rushing to his head.
The giants, Galley-La, and Franky Family managed to get to the
Puffing Tom
and ride it out of Enies Lobby as the Straw Hat Pirates successfully sailed past the Buster Call fleet on the
Going Merry
, making their mission a success.
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Two days after the raid, Oimo and Kashii were in
Water 7
helping the Galley-La workers repair the wreckage of the dock. Having learned that Dorry and Brogy were still dueling, they decided to return to Elbaph rather than reunite with their captains, and invited Usopp to come with them.
Later, the giants and workers joined the Straw Hats at the Galley-La pool and celebrated with a big feast.
Usopp decided to decline the giants' invitation but promised that he and the Straw Hats would one day come to Elbaph and reunite with them.

Later on, Oimo and Kashii would take notice of
Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro
's attempted attack on
Jewelry Bonney
and her allies. After Nusjuro injured Sanji, the two giants jumped to his defense, holding the Elder back from injuring him further as Bonney
turned into giant
and attacked Nusjuro.
Nusjuro managed to free himself and attacked Bonney, Oimo, and Kashii, with Oimo being pushed to the ground. Oimo then witnessed Nusjuro cutting their ship's head off while trying to kill Bonney after which Nusjuro left.

The scene where Usopp explains the truth to Oimo is extended in the anime. Flashbacks from the Little Garden Arc are added in, Usopp demonstrates Dorry and Brogy's signature laughs as his initial attempt to prove that he met them (suffering a horrid sore throat as a result), and after saying that the World Government had lied to them, Oimo is seen crying for joy at the news that their bosses are all right.
