Personality

Little is known of Part's personality, but like many of Sorbet's residents, he is fiercely loyal to
Bartholomew Kuma
, starting riots at the kingdom's Castle Town after Kuma was unjustly imprisoned for protesting the enslavement of citizens. He was willing to leave the island and abandon his home to keep Kuma's daughter, Bonney, safe from the World Government.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Part's overall abilities are unknown, but Conney stated that he, much like the other fishmongers of Sorbet, was quite formidable in a fight, saying that other pirates and sea beasts would run at the sight of his strength. Despite this, however, he is clearly no match for the strength of the
Blackbeard Pirates
.
History

Past
[
]
At some point, Part became a fishmonger in the
Sorbet Kingdom
.
22 years ago, Part and other men joined Ginny in an attempt to free Kuma from jail, but the group was defeated and arrested. They were freed when
Monkey D. Dragon
and the
Freedom Fighters
overthrew the corrupt king
Bekori
.
Part and others celebrate Bonney's birthday.
3 years ago, Part celebrated Bonney's 9th birthday party alongside her other friends.
At some point following this, he was asked by
Conney
to accompany Bonney on her escape from the
World Government
's "protection" of her. After remodelling their fishing ship into a
pirate ship
, Part and the other fishermen of Sorbet waited for Bonney at a port and quickly set sail when she arrived. Soon after, they witnessed Bonney taking down a pursuing
Alpha
and cheered for her.
This moment was the foundation and the start of the Bonney Pirates and their goal was to search for their captain's father and their friend, Kuma. Later they heard that Kuma appeared on an island so they disembarked and searched there, but unfortunately couldn't find him because he
teleported
away from the island.
