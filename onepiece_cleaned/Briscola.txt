Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
When the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
invaded
Onigashima
on the day of the
Fire Festival
, Briscola was in the first level of the basement when
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Sanji
started beating up his subordinates. Briscola got angry at them and tried attacking them with his gorilla, but they managed to dodge him. As Luffy and Sanji argued over who would fight him,
Jinbe
suddenly punched through the floor from the level below with
Samegawara Seiken
and sent Briscola crashing into the ceiling, defeating him.
Later,
Speed
gave Briscola one of
Tama
's
kibi dangos
, and she told him and the other Gifters that it was one of
Queen
's medicines to boost healing.
Because Tama did not have a chance to give the Gifters a command, Briscola continued to fight the samurai, gloating about his crew being strong enough to beat the most powerful
rookies
.
Later, Tama used
Bao Huang
to broadcast an order across all of Onigashima, and Briscola froze before suddenly turning on his crewmates.
When the flames blocked all the escape routes in the dungeons, Briscola and other pirates were desperate.
A week later, he enjoyed the
Flower Capital
's festival and joined everyone in the toast.
