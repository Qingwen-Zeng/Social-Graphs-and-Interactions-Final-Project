Appearance
[
]
Cabaji is a tall slender man with a unique hairstyle that covers half of his face. In the manga, his hair appears black. However, in the anime his hair is light green where it is shaved and dark green where it is longer. He is usually seen wearing a large blue and white checkered scarf that covers the lower portion of his face, a sleeveless brown coat (purple in the anime) reaching down to his knees, white pants larger near the end and held up by a white sash (light blue in the anime), and white shoes. His hair is particularly interesting in its design, long on one side and a parallel shaved design on the other.
During the
Zou Arc
, he shows off wearing a white top hat.
Personality
[
]
Cabaji is always serious, mysterious, and elegant. He is a proficient acrobatic fighter as well as somewhat formidable as an opponent. He appears to be concerned for his captain, along with Mohji. He is usually by Buggy's side, unlike
Mohji
, who is ordered to do other things. Cabaji does not seem to care for Mohji's pet lion,
Richie
, at all, and even used it as a shield from the Buggy Ball just to prevent himself from getting dirty.
Despite these traits Cabaji has immense loyalty for Buggy, grieving after his captain when he and Mohji perceived him to be dead and was overjoyed when he later returned to them with
Alvida
.
Though two years later it appeared Cabaji had grown colder as he brushed off Buggy's impending death at
Crocodile
's hands due to his mistaken leadership of
Cross Guild
, merely suggesting to the others that they had no choice but to follow Crocodile as their new leader.
Relationships
[
]
Buggy Pirates
[
]
Cabaji shows respect and loyalty for his captain,
Buggy
, and also shows great appreciation for him, such as when he cried in sadness when he thought Buggy was dead or when he was taken to
Impel Down
, or also great joy when he returned after the Marineford war.
He has a constant rivalry with
Mohji
, both wanting to show who is the best in the crew. When
Alvida
took over the crew after Buggy was arrested, he showed fear towards her.
After Buggy was beaten up by
Crocodile
and
Dracule Mihawk
for accidentally taking leadership of
Cross Guild
, Cabaji, alongside the rest of the administration, nonchalantly agreed to follow Crocodile while brushing off their chairman's impending death as they continued to party.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
After
Zoro
beat him, like the rest of the crew, he has a grudge over the
Straw Hat Pirates
after being defeated by them.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the staff superior of the Buggy Pirates and Buggy's Delivery, Cabaji has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. His position seems to be the same as Mohji's.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Cabaji has significant physical strength, shown when he was able to lift Richie with one arm and send Mohji flying with a single kick.
Carnival Tricks
[
]
Main article:
Carnival Tricks
Cabaji's primary fighting style, known as
Carnival Tricks
, combines swordplay and acrobatics to distract and take advantage of his opponents. It incorporates a variety of circus props and feats, including Cabaji's signature unicycle and tops, sword swallowing, and fire breathing.
Weapons
[
]
Along with his acrobatic skills, which he uses to glide to enormous heights on his unicycle, he has displayed a fondness for using both daggers and a sword during his fights, not unlike his captain. He also uses razor-sharp spinning tops and has a flame breath. He can also swallow swords with ease, as witnessed when he pulls out a sword from his mouth when the town mayor comes to challenge Buggy. Also, if necessary, in Chibi Buggy Pirate Adventure, he has shown to be fairly skilled in hand to hand combat after his sword was broken.
History
[
]
East Blue Saga
[
]
Orange Town Arc
[
]
Cabaji kicking Zoro's stab wound.
Cabaji is at
Buggy
's side when he first appears.
When
Boodle
appeared before them and challenged Buggy, Cabaji wanted to slice him up, but Buggy told him to stand down, since the mayor had challenged Buggy.
However, after
Luffy
successfully bounced back a
Buggy Ball
and destroyed much of Buggy's crew, Cabaji was forced to use
Richie the Lion
as a shield in order to survive the ricocheted cannonball's effects. He then jumped back into the fray to execute Luffy, but was halted by
Zoro
, who challenged him to a duel.
Cabaji defeated by Zoro.
He proceeded to fight with Zoro and played dirty by striking Zoro's wounds whenever he had the chance. He also created flames through his breath and breathed directly into Zoro's face.
However, once Cabaji was knocked off his unicycle, he became angered and attacked with a slew of spinning tops and more deadly acrobatic maneuvers. Buggy tried to help him by sending his arm to help hold Zoro in place for Cabaji's strike, but Luffy did not allow Buggy to interfere in Zoro's duel. Zoro then took his own sword and slit his own side to ensure that he can battle Cabaji even when he was greatly injured. Cabaji recognized Zoro's honor and thought of this as the perfect opportunity to take him down.
Zoro declared that if he cannot topple all men who call themselves swordsmen, such as Cabaji, then he should give up his own dream to become the greatest swordsman. Cabaji was defeated by Zoro's "
Oni Giri
" which cut open his chest. After Cabaji fell to the ground, Zoro also fell, claiming that he needed a rest after the grueling struggle. As he fell to the ground, Cabaji is stunned that he, along with Buggy's deadly crew were all defeated by "common thieves". Zoro responded by saying they are not common thieves; they are pirates.

The Buggy Pirates surprised to see Luffy and Boa Hancock fighting together on the Groseade.
Immediately after Buggy became a new
Warlord of the Sea
, the Buggy Pirates received the summons to fight against the
World Pirates
. Coincidentally, they happened to come upon the
World Pirates' ship
and saw that Luffy and
Boa Hancock
were fighting with
Sebastian
. Under Buggy's command, Cabaji and the rest of the crew invaded the enemy ship. On board the ship, they watched as
Byrnndi World
fought and defeated Luffy. Buggy then ordered them to help revive him.
Later, they encountered
Gairam
who then attacked them with his
Kyubu Kyubu no Mi
Cube Booster attack. Alongside Buggy and
Mr. 3
, Cabaji was caught in the middle of the attack and was forced to continuously dodge to onslaught of cubes. Later, when the
Tightrope Walking Funan Bros
began crying because they were moved by Buggy's supposed words of encouragement for Luffy, Cabaji and Mohji noticed that something was up and that Buggy was only thinking about himself. However, when the whole crew began cheering Buggy's name, Cabaji asked Mohji what they should do, to which Mohji responded that they should just go with the flow. Hearing that Cabaji joined in with the rest of the crew in their cheering. However, when Gairam began attacking again, the crew made a run for it while Mr. 3 fended off the attack. Cabaji stood in surprise when Buggy was turned into a cube by Gairam. When Buggy said he still had a trick up his sleeve that could destroy a town, Cabaji asked him if it was the Buggy Ball, to which Buggy then screams at him for revealing the surprise. Buggy then used the Muggy Ball which created a smoke cloud which allowed Hancock to attack Gairam. Upon the smoke clearing up, the crew saw Gairam defeated and believed that Buggy had been the one to do so; however, Cabaji and Mohji had their doubts. But instead of questioning them, the two thought it would be best to go with the flow again and joined in on the cheering.
The crew then made it outside the enemy ship and saw a fleet of Marine ships approaching. The Marines began firing and as such, Cabaji and the rest of the crew escaped back to their ship.
