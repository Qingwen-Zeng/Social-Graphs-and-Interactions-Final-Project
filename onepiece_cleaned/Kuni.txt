went up to him and demanded that he pay them a fee to keep his stand safe. When Sanji refused, Kuni decided to become violent as he kicked Sanji's soba pot onto the ground, ruining its contents. Sanji told Kuni he would have to eat all the soba on the ground, and Kuni responded by having Kaku and Suke attack, but Sanji immediately kicked his head into the ground.
