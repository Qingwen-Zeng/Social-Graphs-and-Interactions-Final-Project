"Gourmet Knight" Streusen
is the
executive chef
of the
Big Mom Pirates
,
and is also the co-founder of the crew alongside
Big Mom
herself, having accompanied her even during her time at the
Rocks Pirates
. Prior to his current position, he was the chef of a pirate crew that has since fallen apart.
Appearance
[
]
Streusen is a short and rotund, elderly man. He has a beak-like nose, big lips, and a large mustache shaped like a clover on each end. He wears a pink button-down shirt with a light apron under it, as well as dark pink pants, a yellow scarf, and a very large hat with a big feather attached to it. He also keeps a stopwatch on his left hip.
At age 29, he lacked a mustache, and his hair was black. He wore a dark blue buttoned shirt, a grayish green cape, a yellow bandanna around his neck, and a large dark blue brimmed hat with a white feathered plume sticking out of it.
His appearance appeared unchanged by age 54.
Personality
[
]
Streusen has a great penchant for operatic singing, as he frequently sings in a deep and flowy manner be it when preparing food while doing his job as a chef or celebrating important occasions such as weddings, and can get emotional while doing so. The lyrics of his songs suggest that he views life as cruel, and full of hardships, so people should eat sweet cakes to relieve their suffering.
He also displayed modesty when Big Mom praised his culinary skills.
As a younger man, Streusen appeared to be power-hungry and intuitive, as he quickly deduced that a young
Charlotte Linlin
could help him rise back to power and so worked with her to ensure he got what he wanted, giving Linlin anything she wanted in return. This was born out of a sense of sadism, as Streusen became interested in her when she committed a horrific action that he found amusing.
He was also cautious, as he maintained a distance from Linlin when first approaching her, after witnessing her actions that he found amusing.
Streusen also cares for the safety of both the citizens of Totto Land and members of his crew, as he instinctively turned the Whole Cake Chateau into a cake to soften its impact as it collapsed and at the same time cushion the people affected.
He is against encouraging violent behavior in children as he refused to give knives to Anana.
In the anime, Streusen was enthusiastic when a juvenile Linlin uses her ferocious powers for crime in the past.
Like many characters in One Piece he has a
distinct laugh
: "Kukukuku".
Relationships
[

Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Streusen first met Linlin when she was six years old. After witnessing Linlin's action that caused the disappearance of Carmel and the other orphans, Streusen was amused by it and even jokingly called her a "monster". He believed it would be a waste to let her die and approached her in a friendly and helpful fashion, though he maintained his distance and withheld his knowledge of the fates of Carmel and the orphans. The two then formed the Big Mom Pirates together and built Big Mom's
dream country
.
In the present time, Streusen respects Linlin's authority and acts humbly towards her. In turn, she admires his culinary skills.
He was worried for her safety when
Capone Bege
and the
Fire Tank Pirates
were about to assassinate her, and begged her to come to her senses. Like all of Linlin's subordinates, Streusen addresses her as "Mama";
however, he has also used her given name.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Streusen shows a tremendous amount of leadership and guidance skills, being able to guide a team of chefs to craft an immensely intricate wedding cake,
and influence Linlin into the infamous pirate she is today.
He was also able to survive in the dangerous
Rocks Pirates
, where the members would frequently kill each other from infighting.
Streusen possesses a strong will, enough to withstand a burst of Big Mom's
Supreme King Haki
and remain conscious from her loud screams.
Physical Abilities
[
]
According to
Capone Bege
, Streusen may be a powerful fighter.
Despite being nearly a century old, Streusen has exceptional endurance, as he survived a hard fall to the ground from the top of the Whole Cake Chateau, though he was rendered badly injured and incapacitated in the process.
Streusen is also fast, as he ran across on the outer walls of the castle.
Culinary Expertise
[
]
As their executive chef, Streusen is in charge of all of the
Big Mom Pirates
'
cooks
. He is renowned as an outstanding master chef with more than 60 years of culinary experience. He could give commands to his subordinate chefs to prepare and bake a gigantic wedding cake of very refined culinary craftsmanship with intricate designs of skulls, crosses, roses, and even a large wedding altar. Even
Big Mom
holds his culinary skills in high regards. He has also been noted to be the only one who could remake the wedding cake that had been destroyed by
Luffy
. The
WCI 31
, who are the finest head chefs of
Totto Land
, held utmost respect for Streusen's skills and were shocked that Sanji actually succeeded in figuring out Streusen's newly designed secret recipe. Chiffon notes that despite Streusen's preeminent cooking prowess, Sanji's cooking skills are on a higher level.
Musical Skills
[
]
He is also a very skilled opera singer. While he was preparing the wedding cake, he sang
NON SUGAR LIFE
in an elegant and moving tone that caused his subordinate chefs to respond emotionally, and during
Sanji
and
Pudding
's
wedding
ceremony, he led a makeshift choir consisting of some of his subordinate chefs to sing a melodious love song.

Streusen ate the Kuku Kuku no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to turn any object into food.
By plunging his sword into an object, even an incredibly massive object, such as an
entire castle
, it becomes any kind of food of Streusen's choosing. The food he creates with this ability does provide nourishment, but it does not taste good, according to Big Mom.
In addition to being able to feed himself and others, he can use this power to make things less dangerous, such as by transforming a large falling object into something soft, like
Sponge Cake
.
