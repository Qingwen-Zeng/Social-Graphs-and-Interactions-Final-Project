that has transformed his entire body (sans head) into that of a pug, a small dog breed.
Wanyudo is employed by Black Maria as her personal weapon. Due to his small dog body, he can run along a hamster wheel-like mechanism installed on Black Maria's polearm, allowing him to generate fire around himself and increase the destructive power of Black Maria's swings.
Despite being surrounded by fire most of the time, Wanyudo seems to be vulnerable to freezing.
