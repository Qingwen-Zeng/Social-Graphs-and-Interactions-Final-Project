Muret
was the
doctor
of the
Bellamy Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Muret in the
Digitally Colored Manga
.
Muret is a young woman with long pink hair tied up in a chignon, with one tuftÂ going down. She is wearing a tight-fitting, cleavage revealing yellow outfit with a zipper running down the middle and boots decorated with crosses. She also seems to have a tiny mole or freckle under her left eye.
Personality
[
]
As a member of Bellamy's crew, Muret appears to think highly of
Bellamy
and
Sarquiss
' strengths. She has almost no interactions with the crew, but when
Nami
refused Bellamy's offer to buy her off the
Straw Hat Pirates
, she had been the first to laugh at her response. After Bellamy's defeat, Muret showed her cowardice, refusing to take action against
Luffy
even when the Straw Hats took all the gold that Bellamy stole.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Muret has not demonstrated much in battle. However, as the Bellamy Pirates' doctor, her talent may lean more on first aid and medical treatment rather than direct confrontation. Also, being the crew's physician, she presumably made the bandage around
Bellamy
's head that was seen when
Doflamingo
came to
Jaya
to punish him. It is unknown how advanced her medical skills are.
History

Later Events
[
]
After Doflamingo punished Bellamy, Muret would travel with the Bellamy Pirates to a
Sky Island
. It is unknown what became of Muret and the rest of the Bellamy Pirates when their captain forfeited his captaincy to join the
Donquixote Pirates
.
