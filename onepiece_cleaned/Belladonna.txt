History

Summit War Saga
[

Amazon Lily Arc
[
]
On
Amazon Lily
, Belladonna instructed
Marguerite
and
Sweet Pea
to remove the
Body Mushrooms
from
Monkey D. Luffy
's body and to burn off the mushrooms' roots. Noticing his numerous injuries, she then instructed the two women to wash him in the river. There,
Elder Nyon
revealed that Luffy is a man,
and he was imprisoned after Belladonna treated his wounds.
When Luffy later awoke, a group of
Kuja
gathered around his cell and began observing him. When his arm
stretches
to steal back his
straw hat
from Sweet Pea, most of the group fell back in shock. After Luffy angrily shouted at Marguerite for adding frills to his clothes, Kikyo and the other Kuja prepared to attack with their
snake bows and arrows
, and Belladonna explained that Marguerite was the one who saved his life. Regardless of Luffy's apology, the Kuja unleashed their arrows, but Luffy managed to escape through the roof.
After Luffy's fight in the battle arena, Belladonna was delighted to see that
Boa Hancock
had reversed the
petrification
of Marguerite, Sweet Pea, and
Aphelandra
.
That night, Belladonna was brought to Hancock's room because the Snake Princess was suffering a
strange illness
, with which Belladonna was unfamiliar. However, Nyon recognized the symptoms.
