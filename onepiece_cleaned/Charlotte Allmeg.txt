Allmeg reported to
Cacao Island

siblings
and crewmates to join
Charlotte Oven
's battalion in preparation to ambush
Monkey D. Luffy
and the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Upon seeing the large gathering of forces, Allmeg noted that it felt like a festival. As the arranged time for the Straw Hats to arrive drew near, the decuplets brought out their scythes, and one of the brothers wondered if Luffy would defeat
Charlotte Katakuri

Charlotte Brûlée
would likely get captured, with Allmeg calling her clumsy. With five minutes to go, the Big Mom Pirates prepared to ambush Luffy.
Allmeg later fused with

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, it is
Nutmeg
rather than Allmeg who hits one of the brothers over the Katakuri comment, and
Akimeg
is the one who calls Brûlée clumsy. Instead, Allmeg warns Akimeg that Brûlée could hear her comment through a mirror.
