When

was to be executed at
Marineford
, Forliewbs and his crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
in order to save him from execution. While the
Marines
were bracing for the arrival of the pirates, Forliewbs and the allied fleet of the 43 subordinate captains caught them by surprise when the fleet suddenly appeared out of nowhere just off the shores of Marineford.
After the siege wall was raised and
Akainu
melted the ice with his
magma powers
, Forliewbs boarded Whitebeard's hidden ship and entered the plaza with the help of

But he would retire when
