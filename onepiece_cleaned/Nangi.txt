Appearance
[

As one of the Numbers, Nangi's size seems to be large even by
giant
standards; in one instance he was shown to utterly dwarf the likes of
Jack
, who himself is over eight meters tall.
Nangi greatly resembles depictions of oni in traditional Japanese art. He is broadly built and bears a wide mouth full of sharp teeth, including a particularly big pair of upper canines. Nangi has round eyes, light skin, a wide nose, short, curly, green hair with a matching beard, and a small pair of horns on his head. On his lower body he dons an enormous tiger pelt, which in the anime is depicted as having been fashioned into a pair of shorts.
Personality

Nangi is loyal to the
Beasts Pirates
, as he joined the forces that went out to confront
Kaidou
's attackers. He was shown laughing when the
Mink Tribe
forces activated their
Sulong
forms.
Nangi has a
unique laughter
that, like his fellow Numbers', is based off his name and the number seven: "Nagigigi"
(
