Yarisugi
is a
Marine
Commodore
of
G-5
Unit 06.
Appearance
[
]
Yarisugi is a tall and muscular man who wears a round hat with a short dark brim and a "5" at the front. He also has brown colored hair sticking out from the sides of his head to form a circle and a small black beard with a mustache of the same color, and a scar on his left cheek.
Under a light fur-lined coat, he wears a bow-tie and a dark-colored leotard with the Marine symbol and "G 5" on it that goes from the middle of his chest to the middle of his thighs. He has three circular badges with dark-colored stars on them, two on the right of his coat, one on the left. He also has a belt strapped diagonally across his chest where he carries a sword. He wears metal greaves on his legs.
Personality
[
]
Yarisugi is a harsh and violent Marine, fitting the image of the G-5 branch where he works. Uncompassionate and unsympathetic, he kicked one of the citizens who was begging him to help find their children and even went as far as threatening the depressed citizens outright.
He also tends to exaggerate things, saying, "too" in almost every sentence.
Like most of the other G-5 Marines, Yarisugi enjoys torturing pirates. After Jinbe left
Caribou
at the G-5 base, Yarisugi quickly started coming up with ideas on how to torture him in the cruelest manner possible.
In the anime, he is shown to have a crush on
Tashigi
, even getting a nosebleed from thinking about her and regretting that she has to work under
Smoker
instead of him.

Caribou Pirates
arrive. After setting the stake on fire, he engages
Coribou
in combat and gets hit in the chest by his shovel. The G-5 Marines later defeat the Caribou Pirates, but Caribou manages to escape and flees on his pirate ship. Yarisugi holds Coribou at sword point as his brother abandons him.
