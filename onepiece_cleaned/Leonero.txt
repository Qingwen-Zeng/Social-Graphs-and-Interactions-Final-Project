History

Making their Mark
[
]
Leonero joined the Spade Pirates and traveled with Ace as he made a name for himself. He helped fight off a group of bounty hunters, and, when
Isuka
infiltrated the crew's ship, he surrounded the
Marine
Ensign alongside his crewmates. However, she easily fended them off. After the confrontation, the crew reached
Sabaody Archipelago
. While they waited for their ship to be
coated
, Leonero and his crewmates explored the island and secretly read Deuce's adventure diary. They laughed at his poor writing skills, leading Deuce to exclude their names from the diary.
After the coating was completed, Leonero and his crew descended to
Fish-Man Island
to begin their journey in the
New World
.
At one point, the Spade Pirates were shipwrecked in
Wano Country
. The people from Amigasa Village were starving to death, so they tied the entire crew and stole all their food. The crew watched the villagers finish their meal and then broke out. Instead of attacking, Ace asked the villagers where he could get them dessert. They stayed in Amigasa Village for a few weeks and became good friends with
Tama
.​​ They also went to Onigashima to liberate the abducted children from the Beasts Pirates. They never encountered
Kaidou
and his top subordinates because they were away on an expedition. After Ace did so much damage to Kaidou's castle, they rescued the children and met Yamato, whom Ace had a brief scuffle with.

The Spade Pirates prepare to fight Whitebeard.
After Ace and

tied, Leonero and the other Spade Pirates defended their captain against

like their captain.
Leonero has not been seen since his joining.
