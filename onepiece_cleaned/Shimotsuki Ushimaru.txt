of

Appearance
[
]
Ushimaru had a pronounced nose and dark blue hair that was somewhat spiky in the front and gathered into a large, bushy bun at the back.
Thirty-nine years ago, he wore a dark colored yukata with a light colored marking and a light colored jittoku haori with dark colored images of bulls

)
. On his back, he has a tattoo of two crossed cutlasses over a circular design, which is a symbol heavily associated with the Shimotsuki Family. After being imprisoned by
Kaidou
, he wore bandages around his head that covered his left eye. He bore a striking resemblance to his grandnephew
Roronoa Zoro
, particularly in his youth.
Personality
[
]
Ushimaru was an honorable, selfless, and kind
samurai
. He opposed the takeover of
Kurozumi Orochi
and remained steadfast in this even after being imprisoned by
Kaidou
, his spirit never showing any signs of breaking. When Kaidou attempted to force his imprisoned samurai into a death game over
food
with his son
Yamato
, Ushimaru and the others showed no hesitation in refusing the food and allowing Yamato to have it, not wavering from the samurai code. Ushimaru displayed exceptional kindness towards Yamato, encouraging the boy's dream to become
Oden
and bearing no resentment over his heritage as Kaidou's son. Ultimately, Ushimaru's selflessness and unwillingness to give into enemy pressure led him to break out of the cave with the other samurai and mount a suicidal final stand against Kaidou purely for the sake of Yamato surviving until the
final battle
Toki
prophesied.
Although he maintained his dedication to the code, Ushimaru considered himself to be a disgraced samurai after being defeated and imprisoned by Kaidou and so humbly declined to share his name with Yamato.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As daimyo of
Ringo
, Ushimaru had full control over the region.
Swordsmanship
[
]
According to
Kawamatsu
, he was a master
swordsman
whose swordsmanship was very similar to his grandnephew
Roronoa Zoro
.
With the aid of Armament Haki, Ushimaru could cut through
Yamato
's chain and later through a massive boulder using only what seemed to be regular
swords
provided by
Kaidou
. When cutting through the boulder, Ushimaru was shown dual-wielding with a sword in each of his hands, and true to Kawamatsu's statement, he was shown with a hunched-over, lunging posture very similar to Zoro's charging attacks.
Haki

History
[
]
Ushimaru alongside Onimaru as they appeared 39 years ago.
Ushimaru served as
daimyo
for an unknown period of time before 20 years ago, with the
komagitsune
Onimaru
serving as his companion.
Thirty-nine years ago, Ushimaru was seen reading the news of Oden's takeover of Kuri alongside Onimaru.
Twenty-eight years ago, he took part in a daimyo meeting where
Kurozumi Higurashi
posing
as
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
convinced the daimyo to support
Kurozumi Orochi
as a temporary
shogun
.
Eight years later, after executing the daimyo of
Kuri
Kouzuki Oden
, Orochi gave the remaining four daimyo the chance to submit to him. The daimyo all refused and staged a rebellion against him.
The rebellion was ultimately quashed by
Kaidou
as Ushimaru and his fellow
samurai
,
Fugetsu Omusubi
and
Uzuki Tempura
, ended up imprisoned on
Onigashima
not long after the end of their rebellion. Around that same time, Kaidou locked his son
Yamato
in a cave along with the samurai prisoners for a month or until they agreed to finally obey him. He left them all with
food
provisions for only a single person, and gave them
swords
to fight over it. Yamato grew extremely scared, believing the samurai would hate him due to his heritage; however, the samurai proceeded to immediately give him the food, saying they did not feel hunger.

Ushimaru then cut Yamato free from his chains, saying that he had been friends with Oden and that everyone in the cave adored Oden, and they heard Yamato's declaration as him. As the other samurai request to Yamato that he be called "Nobody Important", Yamato shows Ushimaru
Oden's journal
, but says he has trouble reading it. Everyone proceeds to read it together as Yamato is left amazed by Oden's tales. Ten days later, the samurai tell Yamato that at this rate, they may not be able to see the
battle
that Oden predicted would happen in twenty years. Yamato says he will fight for
Wano
that day, but the samurai decide to break out and fight Kaidou immediately to make sure Yamato does not die in the cave like Kaidou wants and that he survives until that day.
This ultimately led to Ushimaru and the other samurai's demise.
Legacy
[
]
Ushimaru's actions during imprisonment, and his teaching Yamato, would cause him to take on the mantle of Kouzuki Oden himself. Twenty years later, Yamato would assist the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
in liberating Wano Country, in part due to his relationship with Ushimaru.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, Ushimaru takes part in the daimyo meeting held by
Kurozumi Higurashi
posing as
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
28 years ago.
However, the anime interpreted him as a different character and gave him brown hair in contrast to the blue hair they gave Ushimaru in
Episode 954
. In addition, the other two daimyo shown in the anime do not match either of the actual daimyo later revealed in the manga,
Fugetsu Omusubi
or
Uzuki Tempura
.
