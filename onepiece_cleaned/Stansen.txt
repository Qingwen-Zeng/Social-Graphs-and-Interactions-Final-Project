Appearance
[
]
As a giant, Stansen is much larger than a human. He is rather portly, though has muscular arms, a black beard, a thin mustache, and a crescent scar under his right eye. He wears a hat with flaps on the sides, a leather armband on each arm, and jeans.
Two years after being freed from slavery, Stansen's beard and mustache grew larger. He wears a blue open fur vest, a brown fur cape with skulls on the shoulders, a large spotted black belt with a skull-shaped buckle, and yellow baggy pants. He also wears a viking helmet.
While he was still a child on Elbaph, he wore a similar-looking outfit (albeit smaller for the size of his age), with an addition of a light-colored fur vest, and a sword buckled to his back.
Personality
[
]
Befitting a warrior of Elbaph, Stansen is an honorable person, as he thanked Rayleigh for helping him and the other slaves escape. He also offered to help the other slaves get off the island after their collars had been removed.
While he was in captivity, he remained calm and sociable.
During his childhood, he appeared to be cheerful, as he sat watching
Hajrudin
training with
Raideen
while happily eating snacks.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Due to his massive size, Stansen possesses very powerful physical strength. He was able to crash through the walls of the auction house using his bare hands and with little effort.
The only reason he was caught into slavery was because he dropped his guard while sleeping, as his captors noted the impossibility of taking him in otherwise.
Alongside his fellow members of the New Giant Warrior Pirates, he was an S Class member in Buggy Pirate Dispatch Society whom Buggy noted to be their best soldiers. As the shipwright of the New Giant Warrior Pirates, he has sufficient carpentry skills to maintain and repair their ship
Naglfar
.
He also has knowledge of
Haki
, as he knew that it was Rayleigh who knocked out
Disco
with it, although it is unknown if he can use it himself.
Weapons
[
]
While as a child, Stansen carried a sword strapped to his back.
As a member of the New Giant Warrior Pirates, he is equipped with a giant hammer.
