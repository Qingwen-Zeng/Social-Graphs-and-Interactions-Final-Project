Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga version of Whitebeard and Ace's funeral in
Chapter 590
, Delacuaji cannot be seen among those in attendance. However, the anime version of the exact same scene in
Episode 505
explicitly shows Delacuaji alongside the other attendees.
Although it can be assumed that Delacuaji was at the funeral, there is no visual evidence of his attendance in the manga to support this assumption and, as such, his attendance can only be considered non-canon.
