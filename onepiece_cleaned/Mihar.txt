History

Making Their Mark
[
]
Mihar used to be a teacher, and he joined the Spade Pirates and traveled with Ace as he made a name for himself. He helped fight off a group of bounty hunters, and he saved Deuce from a bounty hunter who tried to sneak up on him. When
Isuka
infiltrated the crew's ship, he surrounded the
Marine
Ensign alongside his crewmates. However, she easily fended them off. After the confrontation, the crew reached
Sabaody Archipelago
. While they waited for their ship to be
coated
, Mihar and his crewmates explored the island and secretly read Deuce's adventure diary. Unlike the rest of his crewmates, he did not laughed at his poor writing skills.
After spending time in Sabaody, Mihar and the Spade Pirates descended to
Fish-Man Island
to begin their journey in the
New World
.
Aggie 68, Mihar, Ace, and Tama.
At one point, the Spade Pirates were shipwrecked in
Wano Country
. The people from Amigasa Village were starving to death, so they tied the entire crew and stole all their food. The crew watched the villagers finish their meal and then broke out. Instead of attacking, Ace asked the villagers where he could get them dessert.
They stayed in Amigasa Village for a few weeks and became good friends with
Tama
.
They also went to Onigashima to liberate the abducted children from the Beasts Pirates. They never encountered
Kaidou
and his top subordinates because they were away on an expedition. After Ace did so much damage to Kaidou's castle, they rescued the children and met Yamato, whom Ace had a brief scuffle with.
