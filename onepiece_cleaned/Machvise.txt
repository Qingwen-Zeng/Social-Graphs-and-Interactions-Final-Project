Machvise
is an
officer
of the
Donquixote Pirates
'
Diamante
Army.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist during the
Dressrosa Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Machvise is a large overweight man, with long, wavy, blond hair under a big red hat. He has a large beard and mustache. He has a hairy chest and thick, club-shaped arms, with very thin forearms, which are a bit hairy. He also has short, hairy legs.
He sports a large red shirt with swirly designs on it and a tail-like appendage on its back. He wears sunglasses, and has the Donquixote Pirates'
jolly roger
printed on both his arms, and a red
peaked cap
that also has the crew's jolly roger on the front.
He also wears a clover-shaped iron plate on his back.
As a child, he possessed his tail as well as his red hat. He wore a button-down shirt with a belt and a jacket with polka dots over it.
At age 36, he had a more muscular figure, a shorter beard, and wore a wrestling singlet with a single swirly design on the front.
At age 42, he wore a sleeveless buttoned shirt with a pocket on the left and was already overweight.
Personality
[
]
He seems to have a habit of ending his sentences with "iin". More specifically, he ends his sentences with words that normally end with "ing", which he changes to "iin".
He is rather compassionate, showing concern (though in what seems to be a mocking way) for Baby 5's well being after she was shot.
He is also very headstrong, as he was ready to fight any Marines who came to the island after Doflamingo supposedly resigned from the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
.
When fighting Hajrudin he has proven himself to be both merciless and cruel, increasing the destructive power of an attack against an opponent who was injured to the point of barely being able to stand.
Oddly in spite of his large size, he often stands in pirouettes.
Like many One Piece characters, Machvise has a
distinct laugh
: "Nihihihihihi".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As an officer of the Donquixote Pirates, Machvise held authority over the crew's lower-ranking members. He is powerful enough to frequently participate in the
Corrida Colosseum
's tournaments, where the caliber of the fighters is very high.
It is said that when Machvise and the other three officers of the Diamante Army enter the tournament, they have a 100% chance of victory.
Machvise's true strength was shown when he and the other officers engaged the former Colosseum fighters. He was able to defeat
Boo
, the lieutenant of the
Happo Navy
, and severely wounded
Hajrudin
, a powerful
giant
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Machvise himself seems to have an extremely high level of resistance and durability, not even flinching when crashing into several feet of stone when using his Devil Fruit powers. He was even able to shrug off one of Dellinger's high powered kicks with his only reaction being mild pain, while powerful fighters like
Bellamy
were seriously injured by similar attacks.
Devil Fruit
[

Further information:
Ton Ton no Mi
Machvise shattering the ground with his increased weight.
Machvise ate the Ton Ton no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to drastically increase his own body weight, leveled by
metric tons
. The force of his weight is powerful enough to easily crack the ground, and even the bones of a giant.
His main style of fighting involves getting above his targets, high into the air, and then swiftly increasing his weight to fall on his enemy in an attempt to crush them into the ground.
Weapons
[
]
Machvise using his shield to augment his bodyslam.
Machvise's signature weapon is a round, cross-shaped shield that he uses to crush his enemies with in conjunction with his Devil Fruit power. He keeps it held on his back by four chains while not using it. The shield was later broken in half by Hajrudin.
History
[

Past
[
]
Machvise was born in the
North Blue
fifty-two years ago. He ate the
Ton Ton no Mi
at a young age, but many people tried to take the fruit's power by killing him, forcing him to live on the run from frequent pursuers. The pirate
Donquixote Doflamingo
also took interest in Machvise's Devil Fruit, and after Machvise was unable to escape him, he joined
Doflamingo's crew
.

Sixteen years ago, soon after
Trafalgar Law
joined the crew, Machvise was seen having a meal with the other members of Doflamingo's "family". The crew then learned that Law was sick with the
Amber Lead Syndrome
and that he was a survivor from the extermination of
Flevance
. Machvise later participated in a raid alongside
Lao G
,
Gladius
,
Baby 5
,
Senor Pink
, and
Giolla
.
After returning to base, Machvise and Giolla caught Law trying to run away and brought him to Doflamingo, unaware that he had stabbed
Corazon
. After Law was made an official member of the crew, the Donquixote Pirates spread their influence as they traveled to the
Grand Line
. They participated in various activities such as looting, making business deals, and collecting bounties.
Six months after Corazon and Law left the crew, the Donquixote Pirates plotted to steal the
Ope Ope no Mi
from pirates who were going to sell it to the
Marines
.
They later arrived at
Minion Island
and were informed by
Vergo
of Corazon's treachery.
While Doflamingo covered part of the island in his
"Birdcage"
, the Donquixote Pirates raided and looted the
Barrels Pirates
' hideout. When they found Corazon, they viciously attacked him until Doflamingo arrived.
Buffalo
and Baby 5 later informed Doflamingo that the Marines stationed at the island took custody of a boy. Thinking that the boy might be Law, the Donquixote Pirates left Corazon for dead and prepared for departure. Before they left the island, they found themselves under fire by
Tsuru
's squadron.
Machvise participated in Doflamingo's takeover of
Dressrosa
. After
Monet
opened the gates to the royal palace, the Donquixote Pirates invaded the palace.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Punk Hazard Arc
[
]
On Dressrosa, Machvise was standing behind Doflamingo when
Baby 5
attacked their captain. As she continued in her attempt to kill Doflamingo, Machvise asked her what she was doing.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
After
Doflamingo
supposedly resigned his title as
Warlord of the Sea
, Machvise proclaimed that he would fight the Marines if they showed up.
He was later introduced in the
Corrida Colosseum
as a representative for the Donquixote Pirates in the tournament for the
Mera Mera no Mi
.
Senor Pink, Dellinger, and Machvise defeat Franky.
While
Franky
was breaching the Toys House, Machvise joined
Senor Pink
in the battle against the
Straw Hats
. Machvise was seen unable to move and Senor Pink took a direct hit from one of Franky's rockets in order to protect him. He later jumped at Franky in an attempt to smash him with his stomach. His attack failed, and the battle was interrupted altogether by the Marines, who had come to arrest Franky.
He later stood over the defeated Franky with Senor Pink,
Dellinger
, and the Marines.
When
Sugar
lost consciousness and
her powers
became undone, Machvise expressed his annoyance over her defeat.
After Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his
"Birdcage"
and put a price on the heads of twelve people (including Franky), Machvise, Senor Pink, and Dellinger noticed that Franky disappeared from the Toys House.
They were surprised that the Marines were not taking any action against the Donquixote Pirates even after the truth about Doflamingo was exposed. They then saw
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Roronoa Zoro
, and Law drop from the sky and land right in front of them. The three officers wasted no time engaging Law and the two Straw Hats in combat. Once Senor Pink swam up to Luffy and grabbed his legs, Machvise attempted to crush the Straw Hat captain but only managed to pin down his legs. When Dellinger tried to attack Luffy with a kick, Zoro kicked Dellinger towards Machvise. This caused Dellinger to accidentally kick Machvise instead. The fight was soon interrupted by the arrival of
Issho
.
When
Pica
joined the fray as a
massive stone giant
, Luffy made him angry by laughing at his high-pitch voice. Machvise fled before Pica struck his offender.
Machvise crushes Boo.
Later, on the second level of the new King's Plateau, Machvise guarded the palace alongside Gladius, Baby 5, Lao G, and Dellinger.
As the colosseum fighters fought through the second level, Machvise pointed out that the lower-rank troops were no match for them.
Machvise and his four fellow officers later joined the fray. He got the jump on
Boo
and crushed him into the ground. However, Boo managed to withstand the attack.
After the colosseum fighters banded together, Machvise tackled Boo. Afterwards, Machvise was confronted by
Hajrudin
.
The officer later used his 10 Ton Vise attack to bring down the giant.
Hajrudin defeats Machvise.
He then turned his attention to Zoro, who was fighting Pica at the time, and initiated his 1000 Ton Vise attack, hoping to crush the swordsman. Midway through his free fall, he spotted Hajrudin, who had risen once more. Intending to kill the giant, he quickly magnified his attack, turning it into the 10,000 Ton Vise. Hajrudin lashed out with his signature attack, Gungnir, which sent Machvise rocketing towards the sky. His momentum slammed him into Doflamingo's "Birdcage", with the threads cutting deep gashes. He fell to the ground, motionless and incapacitated.
His unconscious body was later brought to the palace alongside the fallen Dellinger,
Lao G
, and Sugar.
Giolla
intended to use
Mansherry
and
her healing powers
to revive him and the others. However, Giolla's plan was thwarted thanks to
Leo
and
Kabu
arriving and defeating Giolla and saving Mansherry.
After Doflamingo's defeat, Machvise and his fellow officers were arrested by the Marines.
