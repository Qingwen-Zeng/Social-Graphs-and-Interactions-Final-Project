Going Merry
.
Merry
is
Kaya
's butler, and the original designer of the
Going Merry
.
He is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Syrup Village Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Merry is a tall, formally dressed butler whose most distinguishing feature is his lamb-themed appearance. His hair is curly like a lamb's fleece and has two lamb horns sticking out of it; these have been seen shorter 20 years before the start of the series. His lips also resemble those of a lamb's. Even his collar has a fleece around it.
After the timeskip, Merry has grown his hair out somewhat longer and has also grown a light mustache and goatee. His horns are also bigger.
Personality
[
]
Merry is a dutiful butler who sees his mistress' well-being the top priority. It was for this reason that he previously saw Usopp as an untrustworthy and negative influence on Kaya, and even threatened him with a gun while declaring him a criminal. Merry is also friendly and loyal with his fellow colleagues whom he trusts, as he was cordial and jovial with Klahadore when regarding Usopp's claim about former being a pirate as ridiculous, while happy with tears when Klahadore found the present that Kaya had prepared for him, considering their mistress' thoughtfulness and perceptiveness.
However, when Klahadore revealed his true colors as the pirate Kuro, Merry realized his mistake and affirmed his loyalty to Kaya by screaming for her to run for her life. He was logical to understand that the household was not the only ones in danger, thinking of the well-being of the entire village, and that it would be better to just give Kuro the entire estate and fortune as a negotiation standpoint for sparing their lives (unaware that Kuro required Kaya's death to ensure a smooth transition into a life of peaceful luxury).
Relationships
[
]
Kaya
[
]
Merry is a very dutiful and empathetic servant to his mistress, willing to fight and even die for her. He was logical enough to persuade her to just hand over her fortune and estate to Klahadore in order to preserve their lives.
Usopp
[
]
At first, he is very antagonistic towards
Usopp
, who would constantly jump over the fence and hedges of Kaya's mansion and tell her eccentric stories as Merry felt that Usopp's lies would somehow corrupt
Kaya
. When Usopp felt he had no time to explain Klahadore's betrayal to Kaya and tried to force her to leave the village, Merry immediately came to her defense and fired a gun at Usopp, wounding him in the left arm without killing him. Merry knew the tragic story behind Usopp's chronic lying - it is the only thing that helped him cope with the death of his mother, whom he tried to save from her sickness by lying that his father,
Yasopp
, had returned to be with his family. He does, however, change his view of Usopp after being attacked by Kuro, when he tells Kaya that Usopp had been telling the truth.
Usopp, in particular, holds a strong attachment to the ship that Merry designed for the crew, to the point where it once blinded him from the inescapable fact of being irreparable, and he nearly severed his bond with the crew over that.
Kuro/Klahadore
[
]
Merry shocked when Kuro reveals his true colors.
At first, Merry trusted his fellow butler
Klahadore
, as they both see their mistress' well-being as the most important factor. They had a friendly relationship during the three years of serving their mistress together. They also both saw Usopp as an untrustworthy liar who only loves to cause trouble, and as such, Merry refused to believe Usopp's claim that Klahadore was a pirate attempting to steal Kaya's fortune, and even laughed it off as something ridiculous when discussing it with Klahadore. However, when his colleague revealed his true colors, Merry's trust and liking instantly turned to fear and hate.
Kuro, in turn, showed no genuine sympathy for Merry from the beginning, and even attempted to murder him for no necessary reason, but instead for the sheer pleasure under the crescent moon. If anything, Kuro was rather disappointed that Merry managed to cling onto his life despite that attack.

History

Past
[
]
In his youth, roughly two years after the execution of
Gold Roger
(contemporaneous with
Shiki
's escape from
Impel Down
), Merry began designing a prototypical
Going Merry
.
Eventually, he completed it as a luxury vessel for
Kaya
.

Syrup Village Arc
[
]
When the
Straw Hat Pirates
arrived at Syrup Village and—on Usopp's advice—began approaching Kaya for a proper
pirate
ship
, Merry alerted Kaya's most trusted servant
Klahadore
.
Later in the day, thinking matters settled, he collected a pair of eyeglasses Kaya had custom-ordered for Klahadore—a gift to mark his third anniversary at the estate.
Around this time, Usopp accidentally learned that "Klahadore" was actually the notorious
Captain
Kuro
under masquerade—ready to pursue a massacre of Syrup Village and usurp Kaya's inheritance. His ensuing warnings were, predictably, rejected by the village, with even Kaya thinking he was only lying out of spite; when the desperate Usopp tried to evacuate her by force, Merry deemed him a kidnapper, and drove him away with a pistol. Only at Kaya's pleading did Merry refrain from further shooting, instead directing a mob of villagers to chase Usopp off the estate.
Kuro slashes Merry.
That night, after comforting Kaya and putting her to bed, Merry related these events to "Klahadore", who—excited by the
crescent moon
and the impending invasion from his
former crew
—casually confirmed Usopp's words and destroyed Kaya's gift. As the stunned Merry tried to scream a warning, Kuro donned his
Cat Claws
and attacked, leaving the defenseless man to die in a pool of his own blood.
Miraculously, Merry survived well into the next day, when a horrified Kaya found him. Despite his wounds, Merry managed to explain the situation to her, reluctantly concluding that the village's only hope was for her to freely surrender her inheritance to Kuro. Kaya immediately agreed, and though she ultimately failed to appease Kuro, her presence distracted the Black Cat Pirates enough for the Straw Hats—and the
Usopp Pirates
—to completely defeat them and save the village.
After Kuro and his men were driven off, Kaya returned to Merry, and mended his wounds while relating everything. As she finished, she made two requests on Usopp's behalf: that the village's near-invasion (especially Usopp's role in stopping it) be kept secret, and that the Straw Hats be given the Going Merry. Relieved at his mistress' safety, and astonished by Usopp's selflessness, Merry readily agreed.
Merry presents the Going Merry to the Straw Hats.
Once Merry had stocked and prepared the ship for launch (and explained its workings to
Nami
), the overjoyed Straw Hats quickly boarded it, stopping only to accept Usopp as their newest crewmate. As the quartet sailed away, Merry noted that Kaya was actually heartbroken by Usopp's leaving; gently, he shared what he knew of Usopp's past and dreams of piracy, and urged her to draw strength from a dream of her own. Heartened, Kaya resolved to become a
doctor
for the village.

Live-Action and Manga Differences
[
]
In the
live-action series
, Merry is the initial owner of
Kaya
's parents' shipyard and the lawyer of the estate, instead of Kaya's butler.
In the manga,
Kuro
slashes Merry after breaking the gift from Kaya, and Merry survives Kuro's attack. However, in the live-action series, Merry goes into a wine cellar to see Kaya, only for Kuro to show up. He attempts to talk to Kuro about transferring the shipyard's ownership, something he needed to discuss with Kaya instead, and he showed far less trust in Kuro than in the manga. Kuro stabs Merry from behind with his
claw blades
, and
Sham
and
Buchi
toss Merry's corpse down a well. Instead of Kaya finding Merry in the mansion, Zoro and Usopp find his body in the wine cellar,
which is the last that Merry is seen.
Additionally, the
Going Merry
is given its name by Luffy to honor Merry's memory.
