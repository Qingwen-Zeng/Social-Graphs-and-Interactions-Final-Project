Tsunagoro was working in the Iron Factory when
O-Lin
rampaged through the prison and the Beasts Pirates tried to call for help.
After
Monkey D. Luffy
led a rebellion in the prison, Tsunagoro was freed with the rest of the prisoners. The yakuza bosses later approached
Hyougoro
to show him respect, and upon seeing Luffy's casual way of addressing Hyougoro, they tried to punish Luffy, only to be stopped by Hyougoro. The bosses then let Luffy go and left to recruit their followers from across Wano.
Two days before the raid on
Onigashima
, Tsunagoro and the other yakuza bosses contacted
Kin'emon
and informed him of the number of allies they had recruited.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, the alliance began the raid on Onigashima and the rebels successfully infiltrated the island. After the
Red Scabbards
launched a surprise attack on
Kaidou
, the rebels waged an all-out war on the Beasts Pirates. Tsunagoro fought alongside Hyougoro at the
Live Floor
.
As
Tony Tony Chopper
began mass-producing the antidote for the
Ice Oni
virus, the yakuza bosses volunteered to guard him.
As
Omasa
was succumbing to the virus again, he requested Tsunagoro to end his life. However, Chopper managed to successfully mass-produce the
antidote
and cure all the infected, including Omasa.
