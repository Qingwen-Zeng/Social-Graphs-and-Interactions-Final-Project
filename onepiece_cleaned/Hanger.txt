While
Nami
was trying on the clothes in his store, Hanger kept complimenting her on how good she looked. After letting Nami try on all of the clothes in his store, Hanger prepared to checkout and asked if she was going to buy it all. However, she simply declared that she was not interested in anything and wanted something more casual to travel in. Upset by her decision, Hanger was seen crying, but he still asked for her to please come again.
