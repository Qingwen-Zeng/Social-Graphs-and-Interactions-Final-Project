Pell the Falcon
is one of the two head guards in the
Arabasta Kingdom
that serve under
Igaram
, the other being
Chaka
.
He is said to be the strongest fighter in all of Arabasta.
Appearance
[
]
Pell is a tall man with a purple line under each eye that runs down the sides of his face, making him resemble a falcon, his
Devil Fruit's animal
. Underneath these robes, he is fairly muscular, and has two large, star-shaped scars on his torso.
He wears a long white robe with brown star-like motifs on it and a matching hat. He has a big orange necklace around his neck, and also sports striped socks under a pair of normal shoes. He carries his sword on his right hip, so it might be assumed that he is left-handed or even ambidextrous.
Personality
[
]
Pell has a great sense of honor and respect, and protects the royal family. He was willing to protect
Vivi
from
Miss All-Sunday
, regardless of how powerful she was. He has also shown strong loyalty to Arabasta, as he selflessly sacrificed himself to save the country from the exploding time bomb
Crocodile
had set.
Pell appears to have a soft side, gently conversing with Vivi as a child when she asked about his role as a guardian, and using his Devil Fruit abilities to give her a ride. It seems that Pell is very fond of Vivi, as he is shown with a happy smile while flying with Vivi in his flashback before sacrificing himself to save Alubarna from the bomb.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Pell is renowned as
Arabasta
's strongest warrior. With the aid of his Devil Fruit powers, he dispatched a group of
Baroque Works
agents in mere seconds. He is also extremely resilient, as he was able to stand back up shortly after having his back broken or at least heavily injured by
Nico Robin
,
as well as somehow surviving an explosion that could have wiped out a kingdom. Carrying the bomb is also a demonstration of immense physical strength, as, even in his falcon form, the bomb was both completely made of metal and at least twice Pell's size.
Devil Fruit

Further information:
Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Falcon
Pell ate the Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Falcon, a
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a falcon, which has earned him the nickname "Pell the Falcon". The fruit is, apparently, one of five that have been discovered that give the user the ability of flight. Since the fruit is a Zoan type, he has three types of transformations meaning that he can turn into a falcon and a man/falcon hybrid, as well as maintain his natural human form.
Weapons
[
]
He carries around an exotic looking sword with a handle and hilt resembling a plane, and has been shown to be adept at using it. He also carries a pair of Gatling guns which he uses in conjunction with his Devil Fruit, causing him to resemble a fighter plane.
History
[

Past
[
]
Not much is known about Pell's early life other than he was born within the
Arabasta Kingdom
35 years ago and became a
Commander
of the
Royal Guards
.
13 years ago, Pell and
Chaka
defeated remnants of a kidnapper crew who were after the
Princess
Nefertari Vivi
.
During this time however, he was often seen having fun with Vivi, even though he was strict.
When Vivi tried to make fireworks with gunpowder to celebrate the anniversary of Pell's enlistment, Pell slapped and yelled at Vivi out of concern for her safety before breaking down and exclaiming that he would not know what to do if anything happened to her.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
Pell, together with
Chaka
, came to the incident where
pirates
were attacking civilians. Sir
Crocodile
came and helped the people by defeating the pirates before the two reached their destination. When the rebellion began to move, Pell and Chaka wanted to fight back but
King
Nefertari Cobra
refused. Later, they found
Karoo
bringing Vivi's letter, and learned of their enemy's identity from the information. King Cobra planned to attack Crocodile but was rejected by Pell's reasoning that
Rainbase
is far and that the opponent could see the army and leave. He was later commanded by the King to scout out the enemy at Rainbase.
When he found Vivi, he shot the
Millions
who were after her in
his Devil Fruit form
and took her to a safe place on a nearby rooftop. He proceeded to finish off the Baroque Works agents. At this moment,
Miss All-Sunday
appeared on the same rooftop as Vivi.
Pell discussed with Miss All Sunday about the fate of
Igaram
(whom Robin had pretended to have killed, although Pell believed his death to be true). Miss All Sunday then enraged Pell by pretending to pierce through Vivi's body with her hand. However, it was the use of
her Devil Fruit power
(making a hand appear on the back of Vivi's body while her actual hand only punched her). A furious Pell attacked her, but he was easily defeated by her Devil Fruit ability.
Later, he regained consciousness and caught up with Miss All Sunday after she pulled
Monkey D. Luffy
out of Crocodile's sand-pit. He attempted to engage in a fight but Miss All Sunday pointed out that he was already too injured to stand any chance. She then let him know that Vivi was perfectly safe with the
Straw Hat Pirates
and that he should instead help save Luffy, who had protected Princess Vivi.

During the final battle, he reappeared in Alubarna with Luffy on his back.
While Luffy fought Crocodile, he learned that Crocodile had set up a massive bomb with an eplosion radius of around 2.5 km. Vivi and the Straw Hats managed to find the bomb, but they were unable to disarm it in time. Pell sacrificed himself by carrying the bomb high into the sky where it exploded, leaving the city unscathed.
Although believed to be dead, Pell had survived and his injuries were treated by
Potsun
at a remote hospital out in the desert. Even before he had fully recovered, Pell trekked back to the capital.
