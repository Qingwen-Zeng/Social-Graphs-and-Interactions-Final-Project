Mishoin Cashible
is a salesman based in
Water 7
who rents
bulls
to ferry people around the canals.
Appearance
[
]
Cashible is an average-sized, somewhat thickset man. He has a pig-like nose and has long, unkempt black hair, a thin mustache, and a goatee; he wears a small pair of glasses that rest on his nose well below his eyeline. He wears a casual v-neck button down shirt and dark pants.
Personality
[
]
Cashible is a friendly and helpful salesman who will gladly explain what his
bulls
do and give tips and directions regarding
Water 7
to newcomers. He tended to ignore and laugh off the more outrageous things
Luffy
said, such as that he had gold
treasure
in his bag, and was shocked when that statement was proven to be true. He does have a cheeky and greedy side, as he immediately said he would take some treasure when Luffy showed it to him and exponentially raised the rent price of the bulls for the
Straw Hats
, though he was not truly serious and is an honest businessman.
History

Monkey D. Luffy
,
Nami
, and
Usopp
entered Cashible's shop looking to rent
bulls
; when he learned they were from out of town, he explained to them what the bulls did as he outfitted two yagara bulls for them. When Luffy took his large bag to the bull, Cashible asked what was in it; Luffy responded that it was gold
treasure
, and Cashible did not believe him until Luffy showed him, leaving him awestruck and causing him to increase the rental price in jest. Nami asked if there was a currency exchange nearby, and Cashible recommended they go to Main Street on Shipbuilding Island. He then bid farewell to the
Straw Hat
trio and wished them well as they set off.
