Manga and Anime Differences

The Marine that replaces Candre in the anime.
In the anime, Candre was replaced with a Marine with brown hair, rather than black hair.
The only resemblance this Marine bears with Candre are their jawline and puffy hair. In terms of actual resemblance to his twin brother or the manga version of him, he bears little similarity.
