"Diamond" Jozu
is the former 3rd division
commander
of the
Whitebeard Pirates
,
serving as one of the crew's most prominent members.
Appearance
[
]
Jozu is a big, very muscular, broad-chested, heavily-armored and dark-skinned man, called a giant by Crocodile. Even when standing in a hunched position, he is roughly twice
Crocodile
's height. He has a long face with black stripe-like patterns for a beard and hairstyle. His legs are relatively thin in comparison to his muscular arms. He appears battle-hardened and has a perpetual scowl on his face. The dark armor he wears and his hair style are very similar to that of an
Aztec
warrior, with red-bolted dark shoulder pads (the bolts were later changed to gray). On his chest he has a green cuirass, whose front and back portions are connected by metal straps that go over both his collarbones. The cuirass' color was later changed to a rusty red color. Around his waist there is a big, elaborated golden belt, worn over what looks like a green skirt similar to the ones worn by Aztecs, with golden decorations near the edge. He also wears what look like studded, black and gold large-buckled shoes or boots and matching black studded pants. During the
battle at the summit
, he lost his right arm when
Aokiji
froze him in a brief moment while Jozu's attention was turned away from him, causing the limb to become very brittle and break off once he fell over.
Twenty two years ago, Jozu wore a black tanktop and a red sash instead of armor and had a much thinner neck, but otherwise looked the same as he is today. In the past, when Whitebeard declared Fish-Man Island his territory, Jozu is seen wearing a different tanktop design.
When Jozu was a child, he was rather round and chubby. He had stubby little legs, and and sported large black overalls, with round buttons. His hair was still in balls on top of his head, but he had less of it.

Personality
[
]
Jozu is a gruff, fairly quiet individual who tends to point out information to his crewmates. He has been shown as unrelenting to his enemies as he had no qualms in attempting to strike Crocodile a second time immediately after a first hit. He is loyal to
Whitebeard
and his crew, having protected them in at least three instances. However, this loyalty can be taken advantage of, as Aokiji freezes him the moment he was distracted by
Marco
being injured by
Kizaru
.
When he was young, he showed a playful side when he noticed Oden and Toki together.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As 3rd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, Jozu held authority over all crew members ranked lower than commander. An experienced veteran, he has been part of the Whitebeard Pirates for at least three decades, from the times of
Gold Roger
.
Combat-wise, Jozu was one of the most formidable, esteemed men of his crew, able to fight and hold his own against
Warlords of the Sea
and
Marine admirals
alike.
The very division he led specialized in combat, acting as a vanguard to the rest of the crew.
Jozu is also shown to be strong-willed, remaining unfazed by a powerful
Supreme King Haki
blast released by the
Emperor
Shanks
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Jozu hurling a gigantic ice chunk at a
squad of giants
.
Jozu has vastly superhuman brawn, with his arm, grip, and lifting strength demonstrated when he tore a massive chunk out of a thick, sea-covering ice sheet—akin to an iceberg several hundred times his own size, dwarfing even
giants
—picked it up and hurled it back over his head a significant distance.
Belied by his massive frame, Jozu's speed and agility are incredible as well, on par with his brute strength. While still a poverty-stricken, rotund child trying to make a living in the streets, Jozu's quickness and dexterity allowed him to survive through petty theft, evading all pursuers and never once getting caught.
In the present day his speed, coupled with his strength and
Haki
, makes Jozu (especially when in diamond mode) particularly dangerous against
Logia
users used to simply let blows pass through them harmlessly and reform; when he tackled
Crocodile
, the former Warlord commented on both the great speed and force of the attack that had hit and left him little time to recover.
A powerful hand-to-hand combatant, Jozu has a penchant for wrestling-style moves such as tackles and suplexes.
Jozu further has great endurance, shown when he took, point-blank while not in diamond mode, a
sandstorm
released by Crocodile (though one more meant to get him and
Doflamingo
out of Crocodile's way rather than as an actual attack) and emerged unscathed despite being positioned at the eye of the storm.
Later, Jozu was completely
frozen solid
by
Aokiji
, losing an arm in the process. Though he was incapacitated, he survived.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Kira Kira no Mi

Jozu ate the Kira Kira no Mi,
a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform any part of his body into diamond, earning him the
nickname
"Diamond Jozu".
with this power, Jozu used to serve as the "diamond shield" of his crew, protecting them from the front.
In the anime Jozu is depicted using the Kira Kira no Mi 26 years ago in a battle with the Roger Pirates, indicating he ate the fruit at no older than 16.
While transformed, both Jozu's physical attack power and defensive might are significantly bolstered by his diamond body's unparalleled toughness (diamond being among the world's hardest substances, alongside
Seastone
).
A notable example of his diamond form's durability is that he was able to block the "
strongest slash in the world
" from the world's greatest
swordsman
,
Dracule Mihawk
, with no visible damage done to himself or even being pushed back much at all.
Haki
[
]
Further information:
Haki
Armament Haki
[
]
Jozu proved himself a proficient
Armament Haki
user when he successfully attacked and harmed
Logia
users in two separate instances. He launched a devastating surprise attack against Crocodile that knocked him a great distance back
and later another against admiral
Aokiji
, which shattered his
ice form
and caused the admiral to bleed from the mouth.

Early life
[
]
Jozu was born 42 years ago in the
West Blue
and grew up poor. He was forced to steal to survive and was never caught due to his agility.
Adventures With Kouzuki Oden
[
]
Thirty years ago, A 12 year old Jozu was among the
Whitebeard Pirates
when they arrived for the first time at
Wano Country
. The crew was shipwrecked and before going to civilization to get supplies, they encountered
Kouzuki Oden
, who asked
Whitebeard
to let him join their crew after a brief clash.
The Whitebeard Pirates later had a feast with Oden and his retainers. Oden kept asking to join the crew, but he was turned down. Two weeks later, the Whitebeard Pirates tried to leave Wano without Oden. As they were leaving, the crew was surprised when Oden wrapped a chain around the
Moby Dick
's mast and got dragged with the ship. As Oden held onto the chain,
Izou
was also holding on to Oden and got dragged with him. After Izou was pulled up onboard, Oden accepted Whitebeard's challenge of holding onto the chain for three days before he could be accepted into the crew. For the next three days, the crew watched how Oden withstood his ordeal. When Oden had an hour left to complete the challenge, the crew started cheering for him. After Oden was accepted into the crew, the Whitebeard Pirates had adventures with him as well as
Toki
, whom Oden helped, and
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
, who had stowed away on the Moby Dick.
Four years after Oden joined, the Whitebeard Pirates arrived at an island and noticed a commotion that frightened even the animals. The crew then clashed with the
Roger Pirates
for three days and three nights before the skirmish ultimately became a gift exchange. Afterwards, the Whitebeard Pirates parted ways with Oden and his family.
Shiki's Visit
[
]
Twenty-two years ago Jozu was aboard Whitebeard's ship when
Shiki
visited after escaping from
Impel Down
, two years after
Gol D. Roger
's execution.

Thatch's Murder
[
]
After the murder of
Thatch
at the hands of
Marshall D. Teach
,
Portgas D. Ace
decided to search for Blackbeard and make him pay for what he did. However, Whitebeard, who was feeling uneasy, told Ace not to go, something that Ace did not want to hear. Jozu was one of the crew members who protested to Ace leaving the ship and going after Teach, but this was in vain.

Summit War Saga
[
]
Marineford Arc
[
]
Jozu showed up at
Marineford
with the rest of the
Whitebeard Pirates
and their subordinate crews from the New World, in order to save Ace from execution. Including him and Marco, all the division commanders were ready to battle. When
Dracule Mihawk
, the greatest swordsman in the world, sent the strongest slash in the world towards the
Moby Dick
and Whitebeard, Jozu intercepted the attack, and was able to effectively stop it in its tracks by becoming diamond.
Shortly afterwards, he destroyed a section of ice, picked up an enormous iceberg, and hurled it at the
Marineford giants
, but this was in turn nullified by
Akainu
's
magma Devil Fruit powers
. However, this failed assault proved to be indirectly useful shortly afterwards, when
Monkey D. Luffy
and the Impel Down prisoners arrived and were able to land safely in the water instead of the ice.
Jozu hits Crocodile.
He then launched a surprise assault at
Crocodile
after the latter's attempt to kill Whitebeard, and landed a devastating hit. Moments before he was able to land a second blow on Crocodile,
Donquixote Doflamingo
, who had jumped on Jozu's back, stopped him in his tracks with his puppeteer power, and asked Crocodile if the two could team up.
Crocodile refused and sent both Jozu and Doflamingo (along with several Marines and pirates,
Buggy
included) flying with a massive sandstorm.
Jozu was then seen shocked when
Squard
stabbed Whitebeard.
Later, Whitebeard told him to get ready for their trump card, in which
Little Oars Jr.
was to smash one of their ships through the opening of the Encircling Wall and into the plaza; after its success, Jozu was seen with his crewmates.
When
admiral
Aokiji
attempted to halt Whitebeard's advance, Jozu intervened in the battle and smashed Aokiji into pieces, telling his captain to press on. As Aokiji reformed, all the while bleeding from the mouth, he murmured Jozu's epithet, and the two resumed their fight.
Jozu completely frozen by Aokiji.
When Jozu witnessed Marco getting struck by
Kizaru
's lasers, he called out Marco's name; Aokiji then took advantage of Jozu's distraction and froze over his arm. Soon afterward, he was shown entirely frozen falling to the ground. Because his right arm had become especially fragile from being frozen longer than the rest of his body, it broke off of him when Jozu fell over.
Sometime after Ace had been freed, Jozu was carried away to the escape ship by his comrades, specifically by
Blenheim
, another division commander, where he was eventually thawed out. However, he was not present during both Ace and Whitebeard's deaths.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
First Appearance
[
]
In his first appearance in the anime, it was not known yet that he would later be revealed as a commander, and as such, he had a generic and vastly different appearance than he does now.
After the correction, Jozu was shown wearing a green cuirass that had red bolts on its shoulder pads. In
Opening 13
, however, the color scheme had been changed: his cuirass is red, and the bolts are gray.
Marineford Arc
[
]
In the manga, Jozu blocked the attack from Mihawk with his body. In the anime he was forced back and then deflected it into the sky.
In the anime, he was seen smirking when he blocked Mihawk's strike and after he hurled the iceberg. In the manga, he did not smirk or smile and kept his usual serious demeaner.
Translation and Dub issues
[
]
Before the official romanization of his name was revealed, Jozu's name was often spelled differently in different translations. These include Joss, Jaws, and Jose to name a few. In
One Piece Green: Secret Pieces
, his name is confirmed to be Jozu.
