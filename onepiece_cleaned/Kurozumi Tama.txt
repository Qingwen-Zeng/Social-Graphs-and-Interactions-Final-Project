Appearance
[
]
Tama is a fairly short and thin (given her wanting nutrition) girl whose face, befitting her age, has big, soft features, including black (violet in the anime) eyes. She has dark-violet hair arranged in a
Shimada style
with a yellow comb inserted where the back bun is sectioned off plus a pale-pink
hana kanzashi
on each side with a hanging bura (a string of petals resembling upside-down hearts).
She wears a light-green girl's
yukata
with a plain, yellow flower pattern, several differently colored and patterned patch-works, and a yellow, bow-knotted tsuke obi with long tails in the back as well as a light-pink obiage, and an orange obijime. For footwear, the girl has brown-soled
zōri
.
Personality
[
]
Tama is quick to make friends, trusting and helping
Monkey D. Luffy
moments after he assured her he means her no harm.
Being a
kunoichi
in training, she has a habit of starving herself as a means of training her body, forcing it mentally to let go of her hunger.
She is also very brave, as she stood up to the
Beasts Pirates
when they tried stealing her belongings and even attacked one of them after being freed from captivity. Tama has great faith in the
Kouzuki Family
as she used their name as a threat to those who upset her.
However, she can also be careless as shown when she revealed her allegiance to the Kouzuki Family to the Beasts Pirates, drank out of a contaminated river and falling ill in the process
and disregarded her master's warnings not to show her powers in front of others, which caught the attention of
Holed'em
.
Tama speaks with an Edo and a
Tōhoku
dialect. She tends to end her sentences in
de-yansu
(
でやんす
?
)
.
Yansu
is an auxiliary verb used in the Kansai Dialect, most specifically in the Shiga Prefecture, meaning "to be". Tama also uses the personal pronoun
ora
(おら) for herself, which is associated with ruralism.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Tama at her parents' grave.
Tama's parents died when she was still very young and they seemed to have had a caring relationship as Tama brought incense and flowers to their grave while she reassured them that she would survive on her own.
Her parents were members of the
Kurozumi Family
, but the people around Tama are currently unaware of her lineage. Despite her heritage, she holds no loyalty in regards to their plot for revenge; instead, she aids the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
in bringing down the false shogun,
Kurozumi Orochi
.
Friends
[
]
Tenguyama Hitetsu
[
]
As Tama's master, Hitetsu cares for her very much to the point that he attacked
Monkey D. Luffy
when he thought Luffy had stolen one of the only two rice meals she has every year.
He was also angry at Luffy for revealing
Portgas D. Ace
's death, which made Tama sad.
However, she has no clue that her master is in fact
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
.
Portgas D. Ace
[
]
When
Portgas D. Ace
visited
Wano
, Tama formed a bond with him and had wanted to join his crew, but Ace refused based on her current age. However, he did promise that once the two meet again and she becomes a
kunoichi
, he would bring her on board. When
Monkey D. Luffy
informed her of
Ace's death
, Tama was deeply upset and refused to believe him.
When Luffy struck
Holed'em
with the
Gomu Gomu no Red Hawk
, Tama stated that he reminded her of Ace.
Komachiyo
[
]
Tama raised
Komachiyo
from a little pup and he was her only companion after her parents died.
As such, he is very loyal to and protective of Tama.
Hihimaru
[
]
While initially antagonistic,
Hihimaru
befriended Tama after she fed it some
dango
and joined her as the group headed toward Tama's home.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
inadvertently rescued Tama when her kidnappers attacked him. Because of this, she has immense gratitude and refers to Luffy with a "big brother"
(
アニキ
,
aniki
?
)
honorific. She even went as far as to give him the rice she was meant to have, even though it is the most she eats all year.
However, Tama became furious when Luffy reported
Portgas D. Ace
's death to her.
After she was abducted by
Gazelleman
and brought to
Holed'em
, Tama hoped for Luffy to save her, showing her faith in him.
After Luffy freed her from Holed'em, Luffy promised that he would make her life better before leaving
Wano Country
. She was initially unaware that Luffy is Ace's brother though she did notice similarities between the two.
After hearing that
Kaidou
attacked her, Luffy regretted not taking her to her home safely himself and attacked Kaidou in a fit of rage.
When she heard about Luffy's capture, Tama was more concerned about him than her own injuries.
She cares about Luffy so much that she went with the group heading for
Udon
to get him out. She was later happy to be reunited with him after his group's takeover of Udon. However, Luffy scolded her for putting herself in danger by coming to the prison. Tama has grown so attached to Luffy that she is seen mostly by his side. Also, she does not like to see Luffy get hurt, even from people he has associated with when he does something that irritates them. Tama later learned from
Nami
that Ace was Luffy's brother and felt regretful for how she acted, knowing that Ace's death was also hard for Luffy.
After becoming
Shinobu
's kunoichi apprentice Tama swears that she will join
Luffy's crew
when she can properly use ninjutsu, to which he accepts.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Due to her bond with
Monkey D. Luffy
, Tama is shown to have become acquainted with his crew, the
Straw Hat Pirates
. She gets along well with
Tony Tony Chopper
during her time training with him and traveling to
Udon
to rescue Luffy. She also helped
Nami
and
Usopp
by saving them from
Ulti
and
Page One
. Nami was deeply offended when Ulti smacked Tama when the latter was trying to protect
Komachiyo
from Ulti, to which Nami was ultimately successful in bringing down Ulti for attacking a child.
Kouzuki Momonosuke
[
]
Tama befriended the heir of the
Kouzuki Family
,
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, when he was staying in Amigasa Village. She has no problem being casual with him, calling him "Momo".
The two further developed their bond during the raid on the
Udon
Prisoner Mine
where Tama convinced Momonosuke to enter the facility with her
and held him in place when he lost his temper at
Monkey D. Luffy
.
Tama has expressed a wish to see Momonosuke become the
Shogun
of
Wano Country
, which she later got to witness after the fall of the
Beasts Pirates
.
Speed
[
]
Tama rides on Speed.
After
taming
Speed
, Tama quickly bonded with the Shinuchi, who had become loyal and protective of the girl.
Tama also took to calling her "Umami" (English version: "Horselina"), like
Monkey D. Luffy
did.
Despite being separated during
Kaidou
's attack,
Tama later sought out Speed's help in reaching
Onigashima
for the
raid
, as well as distributing the dangos to
Gifters
.
Knowing that her dango's effect would wear off after a month, Tama wished for Speed to stay with her forever as a mother, which shocked and moved Speed.
Enemies
[
]
Beasts Pirates
[
]
As an ally of the
Kouzuki Family
, Tama defies everything the
Beasts Pirates
stand for and was kidnapped as a result. While being tied up in a sack, the Beasts Pirates planned to either sell her in the Red Light District or turn her in until
Monkey D. Luffy
interfered.
Also,
Holed'em
had an interest in her ability to tame animals and tried to force her to use it until Luffy came to her rescue.
Kaidou
almost killed her when he saw
Speed
's betrayal.
Tama utilized her ability to turn many of the Beast Pirates'
Gifters
into her subordinates—including, but not limited to,
Speed
,
Babanuki
,
Briscola
,
Daifugo
,
Gazelleman
,
Mizerka
and
Poker
—causing a huge discord for the
Tobiroppo
, with the intent on having them help the Kouzuki to overthrow the corrupt regime.

After
Big Mom
lost her memories, Tama developed a friendly relationship with her, although she wanted to take advantage of her strength to break
Monkey D. Luffy
out of
Udon
prison. After breaking into the prison, Big Mom showed willingness to share oshiruko with Tama.
Even after she regained her memories, Big Mom still had a soft spot for Tama. However, after Tama witnessed Big Mom's true nature when she had her newest
homie
Hera
consume
Zeus
, Tama became afraid of her, enraging Big Mom as a result of Tama leaving her, to which she is now determined to kill her former friend as well.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Tama has some experience with cooking rice.
She is also capable of weaving
kasa
from bamboo.
Tactical Skills
[
]
Tama has been shown to be very shrewd for her age, coming up with the idea of manipulating an amnesic
Big Mom
into invading
Udon
to break
Monkey D. Luffy
free of imprisonment, which later proved crucial in liberating Udon and all of its prisoners to join the Kouzuki Revolution. Tama also ingeniously thought of using her
Devil Fruit
powers to tame all the
Gifters
of the
Beasts Pirates
to provide support to the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's
final battle
against the Beasts Pirates by having
Speed
,
Gazelleman
and
Daifugo
distribute her dangos to other Gifters to turn them against
Kaidou
, as well as getting
Usopp
's and
Nami
's assistance in her actions.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Kibi Kibi no Mi
Tama makes a dango from her cheek.
Tama ate the Kibi Kibi no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to create "
dango
" from her cheeks. They taste good, but they don't satisfy hunger. Any animal that eats one of these dangos will become utterly tame and subservient to Tama, obeying all of her orders and defending her from harm.
The effects wear off after one month, at which point an animal may go back to the way they were before and return to the wild or choose to remain her companion, whichever they prefer.
While the dangos usually do not tame humans, those who have eaten functional
SMILEs
are susceptible to being tamed due to being part animal.
Weapons
[
]
Tama was shown using a club against a member of the
Beasts Pirates
and had enough strength to knock him out with it in the manga.
In the anime, she used leaves while practicing
ninjutsu
with
Tony Tony Chopper
.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Tama meets Hitetsu who buys a kasa from her.
Several years ago, Tama became an orphan after her parents had passed away. Later on, she started selling hats but couldn't earn enough money to afford for food. But at one point,
Tenguyama Hitetsu
came across Tama and bought a hat from her and assured her that the
Kouzuki Clan
's warriors will return. Tama was then taken under the protection of Hitetsu.
At some point four years ago,
Portgas D. Ace
and his crew visited
Wano Country
and Tama formed a bond with him. Tama wanted to go out to sea with Ace, but he told her that she was too young at the time. He promised that he would take her with him if she became a
kunoichi
by the time he returned and Tama waited for him since.
On her eighth birthday, Tama went to the marketplace to buy some rice. However, she was confronted by some
Beasts Pirates
scouts and their baboon
Hihimaru
.
Komachiyo
came to protect her from Hihimaru, but the scouts took her belongings and she mentioned the Kouzuki Family to threaten them, causing them to capture her.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Tama was tied up in a sack and begging to be free. The scouts went to confront
Monkey D. Luffy
, who had arrived in the country illegally. However, Luffy easily overwhelmed them, allowing Tama to free herself out of the sack and knock out one of the scouts.
Tama takes Luffy to her master's house.
Afterward, Tama formally introduced herself to Luffy and tamed
Hihimaru
by giving it some
Kibi
Dango
. She offered to make food for Luffy out of gratitude and helped him put the
Thousand Sunny
in a safe alcove on the coast. They went to her house, where she made rice confections for him before going to drink from the river to quell her hunger. She came back to find her
master
angered at Luffy for eating the rice, but she told him what had happened. However, she then fell ill due to drinking the contaminated river water polluted by
Kaidou
's factories.
After
Tenguyama Hitetsu
had revealed that Tama had been waiting for Ace, Luffy informed them of
Portgas D. Ace
's death. Tama was distraught at the news and passed out.
Luffy then decided to take her to a doctor, and as
Komachiyo
gave them a ride through the bamboo forest, Tama accused Luffy of lying and explained about the promise Ace made to her. They later entered a wasteland and Tama explained about the terrible environment created by the
Beasts Pirates
before falling unconscious again.
Tama eats some real food as she recovers from her illness.
Tama remained unconscious as Luffy reunited with
Roronoa Zoro
after the latter saved a woman from Kaidou's thugs. After Komachiyo dragged Luffy and Zoro away from a battle with Basil Hawkins and his men, the woman that Zoro saved,
Tsurujo
, told the two
Straw Hats
to bring Tama to her tea shop. They later arrived at Okobore Town.
Tama felt better after receiving some medicine and she reluctantly ate some
oshiruko
that Tsuru made for her. She then took a nap until Tsuru was attacked by the
Gifter
Batman
. During the confusion, Tama was abducted by another Gifter,
Gazelleman
, and taken to Bakura Town.
Tama was later taken to
Holed'em
, who took an interest in her after hearing that she tamed
Hihimaru
, and planned to force her to use her ability.
Holed'em holds Tama hostage.
Holed'em pulled on Tama's cheek, but was unable to get anything out of her. He continued torturing Tama until
Urashima
was sent flying into his house by Luffy. Holed'em then confronted Luffy, putting Tama into his lion's mouth and threatening to crush her.
In a blink of an eye, Luffy attacked the lion head and freed Tama. After finding out that Holed'em had used pliers to pull on Tama's cheek, Luffy dropped Tama in midair and turned around to strike Holed'em with a powerful Red Hawk punch.
With Holed'em defeated, Luffy then grabbed Tama again and ran away with her on the back of
Speed
, whom he mistook for a horse. Speed got angry, but quickly became subservient to Luffy and Tama after Tama offered some kibi dango at Luffy's request. They made their way to Okobore Town with the supply of food stolen from the Beasts Pirates. As Tama ate an apple, Luffy promised her that she would not go hungry again.
Tama then parted ways with Luffy and went back to her home by riding on Speed's back.
On the way, both Tama and Speed were attacked by Kaidou when the Emperor discovered them and Tama was left lying bloodied on the ground.
She was found by
Inuarashi
, who took her into the forest to receive treatment.
Tama was then returned to her home where she was treated by
Tony Tony Chopper
and some of the
minks
. When Tama was worried about Luffy, Chopper assured her that Luffy has incredible recovery speed, and his will would not be broken. He also added that
Raizo
was planning on rescuing him.
While
Kouzuki Momonosuke
was practicing swordsmanship in Amigasa Village, Tama asked him about his
sister
, whom Momonosuke believed to still be alive. Tama commented that it would be nice if Momonosuke could meet her, but he stated that he could not reunite with her until the defeat of both the shogun and Kaidou.
Tama's group takes Big Mom to Udon.
Tama, Chopper,
Kikunojo
and Momonosuke then went to Kuri Beach where they encountered an amnesiac Big Mom.
On the following morning, Tama's group took Big Mom to Okobore Town. Although Chopper was worried about Big Mom regaining her memories, Tama insisted on taking her to
Udon
, which Chopper reluctantly agreed with.
The group then traveled to Udon, with Big Mom having tamed a
Wanizame
to carry them there. On the way there, Tama spoke to
Tenguyama Hitetsu
through a
Smart Tanishi
. Hitetsu objected to their quest and urged Tama to return to Amigasa Village, but Tama continued on with her group's journey.
During the journey, Tama and Big Mom happily talked about oshiruko.
After night fell, the group eventually arrived at Udon.
On the next day, Tama's group arrived at the Prisoner Mines after Big Mom had broken through the front gate. Kiku told Tama and Momonosuke to hide before proceeding with Chopper.
When the emergency gates began to close, Tama and Momonosuke entered the Prisoner Mines.
While hiding, Tama and Momonosuke witnessed Luffy persuading the prisoners to rebel against the Beasts Pirates, prompting Tama to remember Luffy's promise to her.
After the prison takeover, Tama reunited with Luffy though the latter was in a serious condition from being infected with the
Mummy virus
.
Tama tamed
Babanuki
and had him give a false report to
Queen
.
After Luffy had finished his training in Udon, Tama returned to Amigasa Village with him and Chopper two days before the
raid on Onigashima
.
At some point, Tama tamed
Daifugo
and Gazelleman.
Prior to the raid, Tama spoke to Speed and requested her assistance. During the
Fire Festival
, she went to Onigashima on Speed's ship along with Speed, Daifugo, Gazelleman, Komachiyo and Hihimaru. On the way, Tama created many dangos for her allies to distribute to the Beasts Pirates.
After arriving, Tama, Komachiyo and Hihimaru managed to rescue
Nami
and
Usopp
from
Ulti
and
Page One
.
Tama and Komachiyo fled with the two Straw Hats while Hihimaru stayed behind to stall the two Tobiroppo.
As they were talking about Ace while riding on Komachiyo, Nami revealed to Tama that Ace was Luffy's brother.
Tama participates in the raid by commanding allied Gifters.
Tama and her group used her dangos to turn several Gifters into allies. As they were pursued by Ulti and Page One, they went through the area where
Franky
and
Sasaki
were fighting and they converted Sasaki's subordinates as well.
As Tama made her way to the Live Stage, Page One jumped onto Komachiyo's back, but Usopp's projectiles forced Page One to let go. They then ran across an angry Big Mom, much to their horror. Tama called out to her and she switched into "Mother Mode" and happily talked with the little girl, who was delighted to learn that Big Mom had regained her memory. Tama reluctantly informed her about the Beast Pirates destroying Okobore Town, which refueled Big Mom's anger. Tama continued on toward the stage while Big Mom attacked Page One
, knocking him unconscious. While Ulti confronted Big Mom, Tama and the others fled on Komachiyo, but Ulti charged head first into the
komainu
. Tama cried as Ulti began torturing Komachiyo, so Ulti struck her, telling her to be quiet. This angered Big Mom and Nami, who electrocuted Ulti in retaliation.
After Big Mom helped take down the
Tobiroppo
, Usopp and Nami carried the injured Tama toward the Live Stage. However, Big Mom plucked Tama out of Usopp's arms, placed her to the side and prepares to attack the Straw Hats. Tama pleaded that they were her friends, but Big Mom ignored her. While Big Mom and Nami were distracted by
Zeus
' return, Usopp picked Tama back up. Seeing Tama run from her as well, Big Mom was furious and attacked her and the Straw Hats, but
Eustass Kid
stopped the Emperor.
As they ran, Tama cried at hearing the announcement that
Kaidou
had defeated Luffy
and then cried again when Momonosuke announced that Luffy was still alive.
As they reached the Live Stage, Ulti caught up to them, knocking down Usopp and grabbing Tama. Usopp used Sargasso to free Tama from Ulti's grasp while Nami and Zeus electrocuted Ulti again.
Bao Huang
, who had been interrupted during a broadcast, accidentally announced Ulti's defeat to the whole castle, so Usopp captured the Shinuchi and had Tama use her as a loudspeaker.
When
Queen
turned to look at Tama, she briefly fainted but, with Usopp and Nami's encouragement, stood back up and ordered the Gifters to fight for Luffy and Momonosuke and beat Kaidou. The Gifters who had been fed Tama's kibi dangos then turned against the fellow Beasts Pirates. After realizing what Tama had done, Queen prepared to fire his laser at her, but
Sanji
kicked him and interrupted the attack while Usopp and Nami fled with Tama.
As Tama and the Straw Hats fled, Daifugo fought off the Beasts Pirates chasing them and Speed carried them. Gazelleman also informed Tama that the Gifters would look after Komachiyo, which delighted her.
After reuniting with Komachiyo, Tama and the others stumbled across
Kin'emon
's lower body. While Usopp and
Hamlet
split off to rescue the samurai,
the rest sought shelter in the Beasts' Bath where
Marco
checked over Komachiyo and Hihimaru.
When Kaidou descended from the roof and announced Luffy's death, Tama cried while Nami accused Kaidou of lying. Marco then defended Nami from Kaidou's retaliatory fire breath and Tama ran to Nami's side.
When she and Nami learned that Luffy was still alive, both of them were in tears.
Tama was encouraged by Nami to believed in Luffy, and later fainted when she witnessed Luffy's giant head slammed into the rooftop.
After
Nekomamushi
had announced Kaidou's defeat, Tama and the rest of the alliance celebrated.
Later, Usopp asked Tama how long her powers last and she reveals that the gifters will turn back to normal after a month, but some also stayed tame. Speed then told Tama that she wants to stay with her as her master and Tama happily responds to Speed that she wants her to stay with her like a mother forever, to which Speed became touched by what Tama had told her. As Momonosuke announced the citizens freedom, Tama became shocked and thought back to when her parents died working in the factories and when she first met Hitetsu. She then jumped into Nami's arms and started crying. Later, a tearing Tama watched Momonosuke's speech.
After the festival, Tama began to work as
Shinobu
's apprentice and she vowed to join Luffy's crew when she became a better kunoichi.
