Hera the Thundercloud
is a
thundercloud
homie
created by
Big Mom
at
Wano Country
as a replacement for
Zeus
. She is a special kind of homie, having received a
soul fragment
from Big Mom herself,
and serves as one of her personal weapons alongside
Prometheus
and
Napoleon
.
Appearance
[
]
Hera typically takes the form of a small, puffy yellowish cloud. She possesses a notably long and pointy nose, as well as pronounced eyelashes, lips, and blush marks on her cheeks. She possesses long strands on her head resembling hair, and her "hairdo" is parted toward the right side of her face and covers her right eye.
When powered up, she can become completely shrouded in lightning.
And whenever she eats something, her mouth opens wide and reveals several sharp teeth.
Personality
[
]
Hera is almost always in a jovial mood and speaks in a sweet, flirtatious tone denoted by hearts at the end of her sentences. She's also shown to be rather conceited, calling herself glamorous.
In contrast to Zeus, Hera holds the utmost loyalty to Big Mom. However, she does not seem to care much for her fellow special homies, as she immediately turned down
Prometheus
when he expressed interest in her becoming his girlfriend. She was also delighted to devour
Zeus
on Big Mom's orders, even mockingly "thanking" her fellow homie for the meal.
Like other characters, Hera possesses a
unique laugh
: "Ohohoho"
(
オホホホ
?
)
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Hera is far more powerful than normal homies, being made from a fragment of
Big Mom
's very own soul, which gives her a will strong enough to resist the soul projection of the
Yomi Yomi no Mi
's user. Like her predecessor Zeus, Hera is capable of unleashing large and powerful lightning bolts that wreak great destruction.
According to Prometheus and
Napoleon
, she is more "in-sync" with them than Zeus ever was, allowing the three homies to unleash powerful combined attacks they were unable to before.
Attacks
[
]
Fulgora
(
震御雷
,
Furugora
?
, literally meaning "Seismic Thunder")
: Big Mom has Hera unleash an enormous horizontal lightning bolt that creates a massive explosion upon impact, causing tremendous destruction to whatever it strikes. It was first used against
Eustass Kid
and
Killer
, and was strong enough to create a giant hole in the
Skull Dome
of Onigashima.
"Fulgora"
is the name of the female personification of lightning in Roman mythology; the attack's name is also a pun given the near-matching pronunciation of the kanji:
furu
(
震
?
)
,
go
(
御
?
)
,
ra
-i
(
雷
?
)
.
Maser Ho
Maser Ho
(
鳴光砲
,
Mēzā Hō
?
, literally meaning "Roaring Light Cannon")
: A combined attack with her fellow special homies Prometheus and Napoleon. The three homies assemble together, with Napoleon's gladius blade piercing through Prometheus at its base and Hera at its tip, and Prometheus and Hera combining their energies, forming several tendrils of lightning and fire that create a large circular ring in between them. Then, by swinging Napoleon, Big Mom unleashes the energies in the form of a thin, highly concentrated beam that can pierce through flesh in an instant and culiminates in a large explosion. It was first used against
Ulti
, easily piercing through her
tough scaly skin
and immediately knocking her unconscious despite her superhuman durability.
A
maser
is a device that produces coherent electromagnetic waves, especially microwaves, through amplification by stimulated emission. The technique's name may also be a reference to the
Maser Cannon
, a fictional weapon in the
Godzilla
film franchise. In the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Maser Cannon
.
Marma-Raid
(
マーマ
急襲
,
Māmareido
?
)
: Big Mom infuses Napoleon with Hera and jumps in the air, spinning forward vertically while holding the blade before striking the target downward with a lightning-powered slash. This was first used against
Eustass Kid
.
The name of the attack seems to be a pun on "
marmalade
", "mama" and "raid". In the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Mama-Raid
.
Tenman Daijizai Tenjin
(
天満大自在天神
,
Tenman Daijizai Tenjin
?
)
: Big Mom commands Hera's lightning to strike through the clouds in all directions, bombarding her surroundings with an electrical thunderstorm. The lightning itself is sentient, and can change direction to strike at targets who are trying to dodge or take cover. It was first used against the assembled
Kid Pirates
and
Heart Pirates
after they tried to save their captains.
"Tenman Daijizai Tenjin" or simply
Tenjin
is a god of thunder in the Shinto religion. In the Viz Manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
God of Lightning Tenjin
.
Maser Saber
(
鳴光剣
,
Mēzā Sāberu
?
, literally meaning "Roaring Light Sword")
: Another combined attack by Hera, Prometheus, and Napoleon. Instead of firing a beam like

metal bull
clean in half.
Bahoho: Misery
(
母訪砲
三千里
,
Bahōhō: Mizarī

History
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
During the war on
Onigashima
after Big Mom had been knocked off the floating island and, frustrated by once again being separated from and hindered by her previous thunder homie,
Zeus
, she decided to create Hera on request from
Prometheus
. Big Mom then flew back toward Onigashima wielding Hera in her right hand, and, eager to test her power, had Hera unleash a thunderbolt to attack
Eustass Kid
and
Killer
atop the
Skull Dome
.
Big Mom then summoned Hera, alongside her fellow homies Prometheus and
Napoleon
, to fight
Ulti
, combining their powers to unleash a powerful laser beam that took her down in one hit. When Prometheus and Napoleon tried to get close to Hera, she casually brushed them off. Zeus then returned to Big Mom, but she said she no longer needed him, ordering Hera to eat him in order to absorb his soul and grow stronger. Zeus managed to briefly escape Hera, and tried to attack Big Mom to help
Nami
escape, but he was easily stopped, and Hera seemingly consumed him, alongside the
thunderclouds
that Nami had attempted to feed Zeus.
She joined Big Mom alongside Napoleon and Prometheus as Big Mom prepared to fight both Kid and Law after being assaulted by Kid.
She was then infused with Napoleon to strike at Kid with
Marma-Raid
, unsuccessfully though and left Napoleon to fight separately with Big Mom,
but was once again infused with Napoleon when Big Mom, carried by Prometheus, sent Kid out of the floor to finish him off once again. She was forcefully separated from Big Mom after Law, who awakened his Devil Fruit powers, managed to hurt Big Mom's insides and buried alongside Big Mom, Napoleon and Prometheus under the framework of Kaidou's castle by Kid, who turned Big Mom into a magnet with his awakened Devil Fruit powers.
Big Mom and her special homies grow massive after she consumes a year of her own life.
Eventually, Big Mom broke free of the debris and turned the framework into homies by absorbing the souls of the nearby Beasts Pirates. After Big Mom used one year of her own life to grow massive in size, Hera, alongside Prometheus and Napoleon, grew massive in size as well, once again preparing to battle Kid and Law.
After Big Mom beat up Law and Kid, Hera created a lightning storm to stop the
Kid
and
Heart Pirates
from helping their captains, and Big Mom prepared to fly up to the roof and join Kaidou. However, Law used
Shock Wille
on Big Mom again, causing her to fall off of Hera.
Big Mom uses Hera in combination with her other two Homies to attack Kid with her
Maser Saber
again, before Hera is combined with Prometheus to produce a new Homie
Misery
.
After Misery is defeated and Big Mom is sent plummeting down through Onigashima, she calls out for Hera's help but thanks to Law's Devil Fruit the sound of her voice is unable to reach her Homies.
