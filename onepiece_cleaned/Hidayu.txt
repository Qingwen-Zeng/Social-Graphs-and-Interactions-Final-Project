Past

In the past, Hidayu was allied with the Kouzuki Family. After hearing
Kouzuki Toki
's
prophesied
the downfall of
Kurozumi Orochi
and the opening of

Wano Country Arc
[

Hidayu was carrying a log through the
Flower Capital
when he passed either
Usopp
,
Shachi
,
Bepo
, or
Penguin
and was handed a piece of paper. He read the cryptic message on it and wondered if it was true.
Hidayu was among those arrested and thrown in
Rasetsu Town
for conspiring to defy Orochi.
In prison, he and the others received
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's final message of the rebels' new gathering place.
The group watched as the
Straw Hat Pirates
saved
Toko
and fought off Orochi's subordinates.
Two days before the raid, he and his comrades still patiently waited, trapped in Rasetsu Town.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Hidayu and the other rebels were freed from Rasetsu Town by
Denjiro
, adding 1,000 soldiers to the raid's forces. The group sailed to
Tokage Port
to retrieve the Scabbards and commence the raid.
Hidayu joined the resistance and traveled with the Kouzuki Family's other allies to
Onigashima
, looking toward the
Skull Dome
's entrance as they approached.
Hidayu joined Kin'emon's Eastern forces, and the group approached a
brothel
. The group split up but heard
someone
from inside the brothel. They all jumped in the water to hide, except
Chopper
and
Usopp
who were riding in the
Brachio Tank V
.
When Big Mom charged at the samurai and blew a hole in the Skull Dome with
Ikoku
, Hidayu and his comrades were surprised and intimidated.
