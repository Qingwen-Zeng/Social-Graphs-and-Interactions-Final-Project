Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Curiously, the manga has given his name two different romanizations:
Gaburu
(on the covers of
Chapter 702
and
Chapter 719
) and
Gabull
(on the cover of
Chapter 708
). The
VIZ manga
has maintained both of these when translating their respective covers, though its initial translation (on the cover of
Chapter 696
) was
Gobble
.
For the purposes of this wiki,
Gaburu
—being the most recent and often-used—is treated as the
canonical
spelling.
