Shinuchi

Appearance
[
]
Mizerka is a slim young woman of average height with shoulder-length blonde hair that has tips curve upwards and she has a pair of thin and straight light-colored horns on her head which point somewhat to the sides like other
Gifters
.
She wears very little clothing, only wearing a light blue bra with straps around her stomach and dark boots with her waist area being covered by the gorilla
Gorishiro
generated with a
SMILE
fruit.
In her first appearance, while with the other
Shinuchi
, Mizerka has both arms exposed in Gorishiro's body, crossing them over her chest.
Personality
[
]
Not much is known about Mizerka's personality except that she seems to get easily annoyed as shown by her reaction to her gorilla
Gorishiro
's banana crumbs dropping on her face.
Otherwise, she has been shown to be loyal to her crew and will attack people who defect, although she later defected herself due to the influence of
Kurozumi Tama
's power.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a
Shinuchi
, Mizerka has authority over lower-ranking members of the
Beasts Pirates
.
She possesses enough strength in her legs to constantly support Gorishiro without any difficulty.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Mizerka ate a Gorilla
SMILE
(
ゴリラの
SMILE
,
Gorira no Sumairu
?
)
, which caused the top half of a large gorilla to generate from around her waist. The gorilla is named
Gorishiro
and its body is positioned behind Mizerka's, although her arms are trapped in its torso.
Mizerka relies on Gorishiro's arms in combat with the gorilla's punches packing significant power.
History
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Mizerka took part in
Queen
's Golden Kagura festivities with the other
Shinuchi
.
When the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
later
invaded
Onigashima
, Mizerka, other Gifters and
Scratchmen Apoo
stood in
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Roronoa Zoro
's way.
After the Alliance invaded the tower, Mizerka and
Poker
were stationed on the third level at the base of the stairs to the fourth level. Although
Eustass Kid
managed to get by them, the duo received a report that Luffy and his group were headed their way. To their surprise, Luffy never came as his allies had built a ladder to the fourth level elsewhere.
Later,
Daifugo
forced her to eat one of
Kurozumi Tama
's
kibi dangos
.
Since she was not given any orders, Mizerka initially remained loyal to
Kaidou
and headed to the Live Floor to attack the Waiters and Pleasures that had defected. However, Tama then went to the Live Stage and ordered the tamed Gifters to fight against Kaidou, causing Mizerka to defect herself.
