Biography
[
]
Honner was among Noland's crew when they arrived at
Jaya
. They soon stumbled into a weakened
Seto
, who was suffering from
Tree Fever
. Noland then ordered Honner to vaccinate the whole crew with the remaining
conine
they had as precaution.
After Noland killed
Kashigami
and saved
Mousse
's life, Honner and the rest of Noland's subordinates were imprisoned by the
Shandia
and sentenced for execution the next day, unless Noland managed to save the tribe from the sickness that was plaguing them. While some of Noland's crewmembers panicked, Honner tried to calm them down by putting their trust on Noland. Mousse, who had been locked up in a nearby separate cage, asked them about Noland with curiosity, leading Honner and his crew to explain the kind of person their admiral was.
Honner also witnessed Seto standing up for the imprisoned sailors when some impatient Shandia tried to kill them before the agreed time.
Once Noland came back with samples of Kona Tree to make more conine, his subordinates were spared, and Honner went on to assist with the immunization of the Shandia tribe through mass vaccination. He also treated Noland from the injuries he had received that day. In the following days, Honner and his crewmates continued to mingle with the Shandia, watching over their health and providing them with medicinal crops.
One month later, Honner discussed with his admiral the growing discontent among the Shandia regarding the trees their crew had been cutting to prevent the spread of Tree Fever. Noland simply told Honner to ignore it and inform the rest of the crew about their eventual departure once they finished cutting the necessary trees, leaving the doctor worried about Noland's crumbling friendship with Kalgara.
While drinking alone, Honner was approached by
Mousse
, who wanted answers to Noland's tree-cutting behavior. Honner learned the motive behind the Shandia's sudden uneasiness with them, and then went on to explain how Tree Fever had been infecting the Shandia through their sacred trees, which were actually vectors for the disease. The next day, Honner told Noland about the significance of the trees they had cut down, as they were ready to depart.
Years later, when Noland was set to be executed for "lying" about
Shandora
, Honner and his crew attempted to stand up for him when an impostor testified against Noland, but were held down by the Lvneel military. After Noland's execution, it is unknown what happened to Honner and the rest of Noland's men.
