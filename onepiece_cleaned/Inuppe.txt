Inuppe
was a
Wild Zombie
on
Thriller Bark
in the service of
Gecko Moria
who was eventually assigned to guard
Hogback
.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist in the
Thriller Bark Arc
.
Appearance
Inuppe's concept art from the anime.
Inuppe was a penguin whose face had been replaced with that of a bull dog. His left eye was sewn shut, and he had dog ears. He wore a round, checkered hat on his head and a bow tie on his chest, and had short flippers and tiny penguin feet, as well as bandages circling part of his lower body.
Personality
Due to being animated by
Sanji
's shadow, Inuppe initially shared his refusal to ever harm a woman, going so far as to attack
Hippo Gentleman
for trying to harm
Nami
before daring the other zombies to come at him if they had a problem with him doing so.
This extended to his fellow zombies as well; even if he stopped one from attacking a woman, Inuppe would not harm a female zombie, no matter what she looked like.
Though he did not know why he was protecting a woman he was supposed to be hunting,
Inuppe would go as far as to challenge
Absalom
in order to prevent him from pursuing her.
However, as with all zombies who complete a past erasure contract with
Gecko Moria
, Inuppe eventually lost Sanji's memories of his fellow
Straw Hat Pirates
, as well as his emotions, and became completely obedient toward his masters,
to the point of attacking
Nico Robin
, something Sanji himself would never do,
and jumping out of a tower if ordered to do so.
Relationships
Straw Hat Pirates
Despite having been ordered by
Perona
to capture the
Straw Hat Pirates
,
Inuppe was unwilling to lay a hand on
Nami
or allow any of his fellow zombies to attack her,
though he himself did not know why;
this did not hold true for male members of the Straw Hat Pirates, such as
Usopp
and
Tony Tony Chopper
.
However, after the past erasure contract that he formed with
Gecko Moria
fully took effect, Inuppe became completely obedient toward his masters' commands and thus willingly attacked
Nico Robin
at the behest of
Hogback
.
Jigoro
Inuppe's rivalry with Jigoro reflects Sanji's rivalry with Zoro.
Initially, Inuppe managed to fight alongside
Jigoro
well enough to subdue
Tony Tony Chopper
and
Nico Robin
.
However, when one of Jigoro's attacks almost hit Inuppe, the rivalry of their shadows'
previous
owners
sparked up once more, causing them to begin clashing and arguing with each other; Chopper noted that even without their memories, their personalities were still in conflict with one another.
Abilities and Powers
Inuppe breaks Lola's axe with a single kick.
Due to
Gecko Moria
and his crew not connecting
Sanji
to his badly-drawn wanted poster and thus not knowing the power that his bounty implied,
Sanji's shadow was not given a body strong enough to bring out his full power.
Despite this, Inuppe is considered to be as strong as a
General Zombie
by his fellow
Wild Zombies
due to having defeated
Gallant Hippo
with a single kick, breaking his sword in the process.
Working in tandem with
Jigoro
, Inuppe managed to subdue
Tony Tony Chopper
and
Nico Robin
, both highly skilled
Devil Fruit
users,
and shortly afterward clashed evenly with Jigoro himself despite the latter being a General Zombie.
As a zombie, Inuppe could not feel pain.
In addition, he possessed considerable endurance, having quickly recovered from being smashed into a wall by
Lola
despite his relatively weak body,
and was durable enough to match Jigoro's sword attacks with kicks and not be injured.
Like Sanji, Inuppe fought exclusively with kicks; though he did not use any techniques exclusive to the
Black Leg Style
, a single kick from him was powerful enough to defeat the Vice-Commander of the Wild Zombies
snap a large axe in two,
and evenly match a sword strike from Jigoro.
History
Thriller Bark Saga
Thriller Bark Arc
Inuppe defeats Hippo Gentleman for trying to attack Nami.
After
Sanji
was captured by the
Spider Mice
,
his shadow was used to
animate
Inuppe's corpse. After being rallied by
Perona
alongside the other
Wild Zombies
,
Inuppe confronted
Nami
,
Usopp
, and
Tony Tony Chopper
alongside the other members of the Penguin Trio, whom he berated for forgetting that he was part of their duo now, before pointing out the rest of the Wild Zombies standing behind the Straw Hats. As the Wild Zombies began beating up Usopp and Chopper, Inuppe stood by until he saw
Gallant Hippo
trying to attack Nami, prompting him to kick the vice-commander with enough force to shatter his sword and send him flying back. When the other Wild Zombies demanded to know what he was doing, Inuppe declared that he would rather die than kick a woman before daring the other zombies to come at him if they disagreed.
Absalom knocks out Inuppe for trying to impede him.
While his fellow zombies wondered how he could disobey orders and possess the strength of a
General Zombie
, Inuppe proclaimed that love was a power that could make the impossible possible and blow everything away. Nami noticed that Inuppe sounded very similar to Sanji, prompting Usopp to ask him if he knew anything about Sanji; however, Inuppe attacked him and Chopper while demanding that they stop talking to him. When
Lola
appeared and tried to kill Nami with a large axe, Inuppe broke the axe with a kick and was thrown into a nearby wall by an angered Lola, to the confusion of Usopp and Chopper, who wondered why he did not fight back, prompting Inuppe to repeat his declaration that he would rather die before kicking a woman. As the Wild Zombies prepared to pursue Nami and the others, Inuppe struggled to get to his feet and wondered why he was protecting her before noting that his body was too weak. Upon hearing
Absalom
voice his intentions to pursue Nami, Inuppe confronted him and declared that he would not let Absalom do so, prompting Absalom to knock him out with a bazooka blast.
Later, with Absalom occupied with his wedding,
Hogback
requested that
Gecko Moria
give him two zombies to act as his guards;
these ended up being Inuppe and
Jigoro
, who soon confronted Chopper and
Nico Robin
at Hogback's behest.
Inuppe clashes with Jigoro.
Eventually, Inuppe and Jigoro managed to subdue Chopper and Robin, with Inuppe declaring that he would take down Sanji upon Chopper mentioning that the latter would never kick Robin. When Chopper restrained
Victoria Cindry
and tried to have Robin feed her salt, Hogback ordered Jigoro and Inuppe to get rid of anyone who interfered, which prompted Jigoro to use
Hyakuhachi Pound Ho
, which was narrowly dodged by Chopper and Inuppe. After Jigoro slashed at Robin as well, he was attacked in turn by Inuppe, who was angered by Jigoro having seemingly attacked him previously. The two argued over their orders to get rid of anyone who interfered before engaging in earnest combat with each other, to Chopper and Robin's shock. However, Robin tricked Hogback into ordering them to jump off the tower, which prompted Jigoro and Inuppe to break through a nearby wall and fall to the ground below.
Inuppe loses his shadow to Moria.
After
Oars
was defeated by the
Straw Hat Pirates
, Moria removed Sanji's shadow from Inuppe's body to empower himself, leaving Inuppe a lifeless corpse once more.
