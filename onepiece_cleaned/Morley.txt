Morley of Fur
is a
giant
and a
newkama
,
as well as the
commander
of the West Army in the
Revolutionary Army
.
Morley's existence was first alluded by
Emporio Ivankov
during the
Impel Down Arc
, as the one responsible for the creation of
Newkama Land
.
Appearance
Morley is a very hairy and portly giant. She has a
Fu Manchu mustache
and a shaggy chinstrap beard.
She wears very little clothing, only wearing a short plaid skirt in addition to belts around her arms, a flower symbol on her left forearm, dark gloves, a dark bowler hat with frilly goggles on it, and a weapons pack.
Belo Betty
describes her as looking like a "potato giant".
Personality
As a
newkama
, Morley speaks in a very polite and feminine manner. She usually has a very jovial attitude and dislikes those who are unnecessarily violent. When she sees people paying attention to her, she constantly wonders if it is because they have a crush on her, not knowing why they would do so otherwise. However, she does not seem too fond of others being attracted to her, having been grossed out when Betty jokingly implied that the men of the
Peachbeard Pirates
had a crush on her.
Her loyalty to Dragon was shown when she refused to tell Admirals
Ryokugyu
and
Fujitora
where Dragon was.
Like many other people, she has her own
unique laugh
: "Fuhahaha"
(
フハハハ
?
)
.
Abilities and Powers
As an executive of the
Revolutionary Army
, Morley holds a powerful position in the organization, and as the commander of the West Army, she has full control over the soldiers in it.
Donquixote Doflamingo
even pictured her as one of the key figures in the
Revolutionary Army
.
The
World Government
has given her a
bounty
of
293,000,000, showing how dangerous a threat to them she is.
She is a capable fighter as she was able to fight against
Admiral
Ryokugyu
during the latest Levely
and managed to get out safely and unharmed.
Physical Abilities
As a
giant
, Morley possesses tremendous physical strength and a longer lifespan when compared to humans. Because of her size, she is able to move very large sections of the ground with her
Devil Fruit
power.
Weapons
Morley wields a large harpoon-trident hybrid, which she uses in conjunction with her
Devil Fruit
power to move the ground.

Oshi Oshi no Mi
Morley shifts the ground.
Morley ate the Oshi Oshi no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to push and mold the ground as if it were made of clay.
Using this power, she can easily move underground, as well as attack enemies by pushing clumps of ground onto them, as it seems to otherwise maintain its original weight and hardness.

History
Past
Over 100 years before the start of the story, Morley was a wanted pirate who was imprisoned at
Impel Down
. Using her Devil Fruit, she managed to escape the prison, a fact that remained unknown for a long time, allowing the prison to keep its status as being unbreakable until
Shiki
's escape many years later. The tunnels Morley carved with her Devil Fruit abilities would later be known as the Level 5.5, which housed the
Newkama Land
.
At some point after this, she joined the
Revolutionary Army
. Four years ago, on the
Wind Granma
, Morley,
Belo Betty
, and
Gambo
greeted
Kuma
after his travels.
Whole Cake Island Saga
Levely Arc
Morley and her fellow executives
Belo Betty
,
Lindbergh
, and
Karasu
came to the
Lulusia Kingdom
to save it from the pillaging
Peachbeard Pirates
. Morley emerged from the ground and confronted the pirates, pushing the ground toward them and forcing them back.
With the help of the citizens who were empowered by Belo Betty's
Devil Fruit
power
, the pirates were easily defeated, and the executives headed to
Momoiro Island
to discuss the Revolutionary Army's upcoming declaration of war against the
World Nobles
.
Morley and her companions hidden in Mary Geoise, ready to rescue Kuma.
After the meeting at

,
Lindbergh
, and
Karasu
to the
Red Port
. There, they secretly advanced toward
Mary Geoise
along with several
royals
heading to the

On the fourth day of the Levely, the four declared war by destroying the
Celestial Dragons'
symbol and attacking
Mary Geoise
. There, the
admirals
Fujitora
and
Ryokugyu
arrived, and Morley fought against the latter.
Later, Morley arrived at the Socializing Plaza, where she emerged from the ground and grabbed Kuma. After
Karasu
arrived with the keys to the slave cuffs, Morley retreated, sinking back into the ground.
With the exception of
Sabo
, the revolutionaries (including Morley) escaped Mary Geoise and returned to
Momoiro Island
.
Final Saga
Egghead Arc
Back on Momoiro Island, Morley and the other revolutionaries were relieved to hear that Sabo was still alive, despite the newspaper reporting that he had assassinated
Nefertari Cobra
. As Dragon went to interrogate Kuma, Sabo called the other revolutionaries
and denied killing Cobra, much to Morley's relief. Sabo attempted to report what he had seen in Pangaea Castle, but the World Government cut off the signal and destroyed the
Lulusia Kingdom
.
Morley was extremely relieved when Sabo returned to Momoiro Island with the survivors of Lulusia Kingdom.
Later on, Morley expressed interest that Vegapunk would stream a broadcasted message during the
Egghead Incident
, which would reveal the
World
's secret's in the next ten minutes. The revolutionaries then watched along awaiting the message.
Later, Morley is seen to be in shock after Vegapunk revealed to the world that they are currently living on the pieces of a continent that existed long ago.
