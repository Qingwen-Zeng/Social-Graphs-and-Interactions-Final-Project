Guernika
was a masked agent of
CP0
.
While in
Wano Country
for negotiations with
Shogun
Kurozumi Orochi
,
Guernika played a crucial role in the
Raid on Onigashima
. On the
World Government
's order, he interfered in the duel between
Kaidou
and
Monkey D. Luffy
, resulting in the latter's temporary loss,
for which he was murdered by Kaidou as punishment.
Due to his actions and role, he was a supporting antagonist during the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Guernika's concept art from the anime.
Guernika wore a white bowler hat, a dark purple and blue polka dotted scarf, a white long coat, and what looks like a dark blue, light yellow-gold, red award ribbon on his blazer. He wore his tie loosely. He had a flat face with a thin mustache and beard, a scar under his light-colored right eye, and markings under his pure black left eye. What appeared to be a mask seemed more likely to be white make-up, as his mouth was moving while he addressed the people.
Personality
[
]
Like most of CP0's agents, Guernika was professional and prioritized his missions above all else.
However, he could be quick to anger as shown when he attacked Apoo at point blank range for calling him and
Maha
the
World Nobles
' dogs, and was even willing to eliminate Drake, an undercover agent of
SWORD
whom he considers to be an inconvenience.
He also expressed envy towards Drake for his self-determination.
When Guernika was confronted by Kaidou for his interference, he allowed himself to be attack by Kaidou without fear or attempting to flee.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Guernika was considered by the
Five Elders
to be one of their finest agents.
This was also indicated by the fact that he wears a mask, a sign of elite status within
CP0
.
He often acted as a spokesperson for the organization as a whole.
During their pursuit of Robin, Guernika and
Maha
defeated various powerful individuals present at
Onigashima
, including numerous
Mink
warriors.
They also faced two members of the Worst Generation,
Apoo
and
X Drake
, alongside
Zanki
and
Inbi
(two of the
Numbers
), with
Izou
getting in his and Maha's way later on.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Guernika possessed a great degree of stamina and endurance, showing few signs of exhaustion after multiple battles. He dove through
Kazenbo
and emerged unscathed, despite being engulfed in flames in the process. Apoo's
sound-based explosion
, which was powerful enough to temporarily knock Luffy unconscious, had little effect on him.
Even getting stabbed through the back with a sword by X Drake did not stop him from reaching the top of
Onigashima
to interfere in
Luffy
and
Kaidou
's battle.
Guernika was incredibly fast, having been able to reach the top of Onigashima in a short period of time. Furthermore, he was able to latch onto Luffy before he could unleash his attack against Kaidou and get away from the latter just before he could land his own attack.
Rokushiki

Rokushiki
As a masked agent of CP0, the elite
Cipher Pol
agency, Guernika was a master assassin and a highly skilled user of Rokushiki. He had shown the ability to use
Soru
,
Shigan
,
and
Tekkai
. His Tekkai was strong enough to hold back Luffy in his
Boundman form
for a few moments, allowing Kaidou to land a near fatal attack.

Guernika was able to use

Guernika communicates with Dressrosa's citizens.
Guernika,
Joseph
, and
Gismonda
traveled to
Dressrosa
in order to dismiss the previously reported revocation of
Donquixote Doflamingo
from the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
as a printing mistake to the country's population. They also insisted that the citizens remain quiet about this until the new report was published.
The three agents later wandered around the island and were spotted by
Nico Robin
,
Trafalgar Law
,
Caesar Clown
, and
Usopp
.

Wano Country Arc
[
]
In the
Flower Capital
, Guernika,
Maha
, and
Joseph
negotiated with
Shogun
Kurozumi Orochi
about the new supply of weapons to the
World Government
after the arrest of
Donquixote Doflamingo
. Due to Orochi's surreal demands, CP0 was unable to agree to his terms.
The CP0 agents monitor the raid on Onigashima.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Guernika and the two other agents stayed in
Onigashima
's guest room and used a
Go board
to track the forces during the
raid on Onigashima
, with Guernika expressing satisfaction in two pirate forces weakening each other.
Guernika also took part in the discussion regarding
Who's-Who
, agreeing with Joseph that Who's-Who's chances of living were not high as the Tobiroppo was facing the former Warlord,
Jinbe
.
Guernika then received a call via
Den Den Mushi
from
Rob Lucci
, who told him that the World Government was planning on annexing Wano Country under their direct control if Kaidou lost. Lucci also told him that they had direct orders on capturing Robin due to the danger she posed to the world.
Guernika and Maha left their room
and pursued Robin, defeating several
minks
who tried to stop them. When
Brook
then carried Robin over a ledge, the agents chased after them to the second basement floor of Kaidou's castle.
As the agents jumped down towards Robin and Brook, they were engulfed by
Kurozumi Kanjuro
's
Kazenbo
, but emerged unscathed.
Guernika attacks Apoo.
Guernika noticed that
Scratchmen Apoo
was photographing them. When the pirate bragged about selling the pictures to Morgans, Guernika used
Shigan
to stab him, causing the pirate to fall to the ground. Guernika then addressed
X Drake
and confessed to knowing he was a secret Marine. When Drake questioned why the government agents were there as well, Guernika attacked him but was interrupted by Apoo, who had survived the attack. The pirates then allied themselves against the two government agents.
After Apoo and
Inbi
abandoned the fight and fled, the agents defeated Drake and
Zanki
. Guernika then received the call from Joseph, reminding them of their mission to capture Robin while also informing them of the All-Stars' defeat at the hands of the alliance. However, Joseph pointed out there were still two Emperors to defeat, but should they fall at the hand of the new generation, this would set the course for the times to come.
Guernika defeats Drake.
Guernika and Maha reached the first basement floor, where they encountered
Izou
, who had dropped down from the crawlspace above. Guernika was willing to overlook the Whitebeard Pirate's presence for the sake of their mission in capturing Robin and dealing with the Straw Hats, but Izou refused to let them leave.
The fight ended with a double knockout of Maha and Izou. Guernika then received another call from Joseph, who said that they had received a direct order from the
Five Elders
, telling them to immediately eliminate Luffy to prevent him from defeating Kaidou. However, Guernika said that it would be impossible, even going as far as to ask why he had to interfere in the Kaidou fight, knowing the repercussion from his interference. Unbeknownst to Guernika, Drake had gotten up and followed after the agents. After overhearing the call,
Drake stabbed Guernika through the back. Drake explained that this was his form of justice, to which Guernika replied that he envied Drake's conviction. The agent then used Soru to free himself and use Shigan, piercing Drake through the neck and knocking him unconscious.
Guernika accepting Kaidou's fury.
Guernika made his way to the rooftop and used
Tekkai
to hold Luffy back, causing Kaidou to unfairly win the battle, much to the Emperor's dismay.
Knowing that there would be consequences from interfering, Guernika only tipped his hat as he accepted his fate, which resulted in him being fatally struck by
Kaidou's kanabo
.
Guernika's mission ended up being a failure, as it was Kaidou's lethal blow that caused Luffy to awaken
his Devil Fruit
, which was specifically what the Five Elders were attempting to prevent. Before he succumbed to his wounds,
he managed to take a picture of Luffy's
awakened form
and send it to the Marines.
