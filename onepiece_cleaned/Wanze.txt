Wanze
is an agent of
CP7
and a
cook
, specializing in making ramen noodles.
He was one of the antagonists during the
Sea Train
voyage in the
Water 7 Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Wanze has an almost permanent smile on his face, even when he is afraid or mad. He has white fluffy hair and buck teeth, with spiral-designs on his cheek, and his eyes seem to extend off of his face with his skin and eyelids as well. Wanze wears a black shirt unbuttoned, revealing his chest, a yellow scarf, black pants with an orange belt, and roller skates. The back of his jacket reads "MAD". On both his forearms, Wanze has tattooed the kanji 拳
(
kanji meaning "fist"
?
)
. He also wears a white chef's jacket with the World Government's symbol on its back, to which he removes prior to battle.
After getting hit by
Sanji
's
Parage Shot
, Wanze's face is molded into something that resembles a stereotypical
Bishōnen
; ironically, he finds this form to be rather ugly. His face changes back to its former appearance after a kick to his torso from Sanji.
Personality
[
]
Wanze is loud, obnoxious and explicitly annoying who often acts in a whimsical or uncontrolled manner, which is often done to goad his enemies into underestimating him and his abilities. As a master in Ramen Kenpo, Wanze also takes pride in his fighting style and acts confident in showing his enemies when he states that CP9 had chose him on the train to keep intruders out.
However, he is a bit dense and can be short tempered. Furthermore, he oddly becomes dizzy when he sees spirals, such as Sanji's eyebrow.
One of the main key features of Wanze is his constant facial expression (the "dumb" smile) that never changes even when he claims to be scared, which often annoys and provokes his enemies.
However, he did get genuinely mad when Sanji changed him into a bishonen and claimed to be mutilated.
Given his loyalty to the
World Government
and
Cipher Pol
, Wanze is an advocate for
Absolute Justice
and is naturally prejudiced against criminals that threaten them regardless of their character. As such he is not above slandering and disparaging
Nico Robin
given her infamous reputation much to Sanji's anger.
Like other One Piece characters, Wanze has his own
Laughter Style
, starting it with "Sa" (i.e. Sasasasasasa!). He also tends to say a verbal tic, "Go-go-go!", when he is excited.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Wanze is
CP7
's melee fighting expert, whose skills serve as additional security for
CP9
's return voyage to Enies Lobby. He is quite analytical, as he was able to figure out Sanji's weakness (in that immobilizing his legs makes him powerless) after fighting with him for only a few minutes.
Ramen Kenpo

Further information:
Ramen Kenpo

Wanze is a chef who specializes in making
ramen
out of his own body by a process of eating flour, kneading the dough in his mouth,  and cutting it with his fishnet-shaped nose hairs into noodles which are extracted out of his nose.
He mainly uses his ramen cooking specialty as part of his own fighting style,
Ramen Kenpo
. In battle, Wanze can control his self-made ramen in different techniques, which includes shooting noodles out of his nose at highspeed,
as well as kneading ramen to form a battle suit.
Weapons
[
]
Alongside his Ramen Kenpo, Wanze uses various bladed weapons. He also wears a pair of roller skates with circular blades as wheels, which can ignite fire from friction and enhance his kicks.
He also throws kitchen knives and wields a large poisoned knife.
History
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
Wanze was first mentioned by
Corgi
having occupied the
Sea Train
's fourth car going from
Water 7
to
Enies Lobby
, to which he serves as head waiter of its current voyage.
He was then informed by a
Marine
soldier of trouble aboard the train, only for Wanze telling him to shut up over having trouble of his own.
As
Sanji
,
Sogeking
, and
Franky
went into his car while invading the train, Wanze was shown skating across the kitchen with a food trolley and his skates. Upon introducing himself the chef immediately offers them his special ramen by demonstrating the way he makes it, much to the trio's collective disgust. Instead allowing them go ahead of him, Wanze stated they would have to go through him first.
Franky fired an explosive shot at Wanze, which grazed his hair and left him shocked, though Wanze's unusual expression and reaction angered the trio. Sanji tried to kick him, which Wanze also dodged. Sanji confronted Wanze to allow Sogeking and Franky to go on. Wanze used
Ramen Beam
, but they managed to dodge the noodle projectiles. Sanji attacked Wanze again, allowing Sogeking and Franky to escape. However, Wanze laughed because
Nero
of
CP9
was in the next car. Wanze ignited his roller skates before kicking at Sanji, who managed to dodge the attack and kick Wanze 12 times. Wanze and Sanji then exchanged insults before Wanze created a battle suit out of ramen. He gloated about this technique, angering Sanji due to his waste of food.
Sanji's knife handling vs. Wanze's Ramen Kenpo.
Wanze managed to overpower Sanji by trapping him in his ramen fists. Sanji tried attacking his unprotected head, but Wanze used Ramen Beam to stop him. Wanze stated that he had figured out
Sanji's fighting style
and sent several waves of ramen down on Sanji, but Sanji pulled out two knives and cut apart the ramen. Being able to use kitchen tools due to Wanze using food as his weapon, Sanji prepared to show Wanze his skills with them.
Sanji cut off Wanze's ramen arms, and Wanze was intent on upholding his mission as he kicked at Sanji with ramen legs. However, Sanji cleanly cut the legs into little pieces, and Wanze used Ramen Beam once again in desperation, but Sanji cut the remainder of his suit into several pieces. He was not hurt due to Sanji not wanting to use weapons on him, and as Sanji put the knives back, he took the knives and threw them at Sanji. However, Sanji managed to dodge them and kicked Wanze several times in the face. Wanze questioned Sanji's motives for rescuing
Nico Robin
, but this only made Sanji angrier and caused him to use Parage Shoot on Wanze, changing his face into that of a
bishōnen
.
Sanji stated that Wanze had committed the crimes of calling himself a chef, wasting food, and speaking ill of his friend. Intent on preventing Sanji from advancing through the train, Wanze pulled out a large poison-soaked knife and charged with it. However, Sanji repeatedly kicked him across the torso, sending him crashing into the fifth car where the CP9 agents were, leaving him lying unconscious in the aisle.

Early Concepts
[
]
Wanze was originally going to be a sexy female chef, but was changed to a male "surfer dude" with goggles. His third design resembled a stereotypical French chef, his 4th design was very close to Wanze's bishonen look, and his 5th design had ape-like features and goggles.
