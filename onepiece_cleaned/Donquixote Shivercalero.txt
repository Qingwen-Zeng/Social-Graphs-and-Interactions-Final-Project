Past
[
]
Ten years ago, Shivercalero's son
Mjosgard
asked him why the former
fish-man
slaves were allowed to return to
Fish-Man Island
. Shivercalero explained that the former slaves had received a pardon due to
Jinbe
joining the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, he holds his wine glass by himself while wrapping his arm around one of his slave women. In the anime, the slave woman holds the wine glass for him. The anime also gives him some additional dialogue where he expresses his anger at the fact that the former
fish-men
slaves were pardoned, while in the manga he only explained the matter.
