When

was to be executed at
Marineford
, Colscon and his crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
in order to save him from execution. While the
Marines
were bracing for the arrival of the pirates, Colscon and the allied fleet of the 43 subordinate captains caught them by surprise when the fleet suddenly appeared out of nowhere just off the shores of Marineford.
Just after Ace was fatally injured by
Admiral
Akainu

Afterwards, the
Red Hair Pirates
arrived and Sengoku ended the war, allowing the surviving pirates to leave.
