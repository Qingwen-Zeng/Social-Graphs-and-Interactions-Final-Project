Van Augur
,
nicknamed
"The Supersonic"
, is the
sniper
of the
Blackbeard Pirates
,
as well as one of the
Ten Titanic Captains
, as the captain of the Third Ship.
Due to his actions and role, he is a minor antagonist in the
Jaya Arc
, a supporting antagonist in the
Impel Down
and
Marineford Arcs
, a minor antagonist in the
Egghead Arc
, and a major antagonist in the
Final Saga
.
Appearance
[
]
Augur is a rather thin man, with light brown hair that hangs down to his lower neck. He is extremely tall, standing at around the same height as Blackbeard, who is over 11 feet tall. He appears calm all the time, even in battles, and his typical expression is generally emotionless. His eyebrows are almost always furrowed in what looks like a saddened expression, and he rarely smiles. The left lens of the black glasses he wears is a normal, rectangular eyepiece, but the right side is circular and holds what appears to be a cross hair.
He sports a large black hat, protruding out to both sides. Its shape bears an uncanny resemblance to an upturned boat's hull. Augur is constantly wearing a long black cape, under which he wears a button-up, pale lavender shirt with loose sleeves, and simple black pants, with a maroon belt with an aqua outline that goes over a small portion of his shirt. He also wears black shoes. Due to the size of his rifle
Senriku
, he carries it leaned against his shoulder.
After the timeskip, Augur has grown a goatee.
Personality
[
]
Augur is extremely calm and analytical even during battle. He very rarely changes his facial expression. However, in his confrontation with
Ace
on
Banaro Island
, he showed a darker side - showing a devilish grin after a failed kill shot. Like his crewmates, Augur is a heavy believer in fate. He displays very strong loyalty to
Blackbeard
and the rest of the crew. He has no qualms about ending the lives of some seagulls to assert his luck on whether they would die from his shots or not.
Relationships
[
]
Marshall D. Teach
[
]
As one of the four original recruits of the
Blackbeard Pirates
, Augur is fiercely loyal to his
Admiral
; however, he will not hesitate to scold
Teach
for his rash actions and sometimes act as the voice of reason. He comes to Teach's aid when he feels it is necessary as seen during the crew's
encounter
with
Ace
and the battle with the
Heart Pirates
. He is protective for his Admiral's well-being, as he doubted
Caribou
's offer for information in exchange for joining their crew, believing the possibility that the rookie may be seeking to assassinate Teach.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the
sniper
of the
Blackbeard Pirates
and one of its founding members,
Augur is a powerful pirate. After the timeskip, he has become one of the Ten Titanic Captains of the crew that personally guard the Emperor
Blackbeard
, and has gained great authority in the crew as captain of its third Ship.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Augur is shown to have great speed in shooting and running, as he did during his battle against
Portgas D. Ace
, by dodging their fire bullets. His powerful eyesight makes him a valuable asset as a scout for the crew, as he managed to spot
Akainu
on board an approaching Marine battleship.
He also demonstrated superhuman stamina for his slim figure when he withstood one of
Gura Gura no Mi
of
Whitebeard
shockwaves (though not a direct hit)
and Fleet Admiral
Sengoku
's
shockwave
with the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates, and recovered quickly.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Wapu Wapu no Mi
Augur ate the Wapu Wapu no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to teleport himself and others from place to place, but to teleport someone, he must make physical contact with the target.
However, Augur does not have a complete mastery of his powers yet so his range of travel is limited.
Marksmanship
[
]
Augur is possibly one of the greatest master marksmen in the entire series. With his favorite rifle Senriku, Augur is able to fire bullets over tremendous distances with extraordinary accuracy. This is shown when
Chopper
suggested to
Usopp
that the seagulls flying around their ship were sniped from an extremely long distance,
Nami
immediately disclaims it since they could not see the island Augur was on, saying it was 'impossible' for any sniper to do. Augur was even able to tell after he shot the birds that one of them did not die immediately, showing his immensely sharp vision.
Another example of his immense marksmanship skills (which is seen in the anime) is when he shot through the bullets of
Impel Down
's staff, and then through the barrels of their guns, destroying them. It was because of this that he was also able to discern Akainu being on board of the incoming battleship from afar.
Weapons
[
]
Further information:
Senriku
Augur wielding the Senriku.
Augur uses a musket-like rifle called "Senriku" in battle.
It is extra-long with a flaring muzzle like a blunderbuss, and allows extraordinary long-ranged shooting. Combined with his eyesight and immense marksmanship skills, this makes Senriku a lethal long-range weapon. However, Augur has also used it for point-blank attack against Whitebeard.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
So far most of Augur's past is unknown, such as how he joined
Blackbeard
's crew in the first place and where he obtained his gun; all that is known about his past is that he was born in the
East Blue
.
Sometime after joining the
Blackbeard Pirates
, Augur and the entire crew attacked
Drum Island
forcing the cowardly
King Wapol
to flee.

Banaro Island
, read about the incident with the
Straw Hats

Laffitte

Sea Train
and the fact that
Water 7
was nearby. Augur claims that she is not very far from there. When they were about to go out for Luffy,
Portgas D. Ace
appeared.
When Ace rejects his captain's proposal to join his crew, Augur shoots him, but to no avail. Sarcastically, Ace tells him that he doesn't have good manners and tries to hit him with fire bullets, which Augur manages to dodge, while Burgess also participates in the skirmish. At that moment, Teach tells them they can't beat Ace and therefore to get away, but they are all hit beaten by the latter. He then retreats along with the rest on the orders of his captain.
He watches the fight from afar, where he claims to have thought that the holders of the devil's fruits would become fragile if they were found without their powers, but Ace is the commander of one of divisions of Whitebeard, defining his impressive fighting skills. He also adds that fate places them in front of one of his crossroads.

[
]

was rioting in Level 4.
As they made their way through Level 1, they encountered former Head Jailer
Shiryu
, and then made their way down to Level 4, where they encountered the escaping prisoners.
After musing that their meeting was fate, not coincidence, Augur stood by as Blackbeard and Luffy briefly fought. After exchanging words with the prisoners, the Blackbeard Pirates continued on their way to the lower levels and confronted Chief Warden
Magellan
, who poisoned them with his
Hydra technique
.
Later, the whole crew was saved by an antidote from Shiryu, who accepted Blackbeard's offer and joined their crew.
When they reached Level 6, the Blackbeard Pirates had the prisoners fight to the death with the survivors joining the crew.

[
]
The Blackbeard Pirates flee from Admiral Akainu.
The Blackbeard Pirates made their move in the
New World
, taking out
Jewelry Bonney
in the process. The crew was bickering amongst each other on a fiery island. The
Blackbeard Pirates' raft
was brought close to the point of destruction due to
Sanjuan Wolf
's size, and they seemingly got in contact with the
Marines
to trade Jewelry Bonney for a battleship. On look out, Augur alerted Teach that the battleship had arrived, but not for a trade because
Akainu
is on board. Knowing that the deal would not happen, the Blackbeard Pirates fled, leaving Bonney and
her crew
behind to be arrested.
During the Timeskip
[
]
One year after the war at Marineford, the Blackbeard Pirates
fought against
the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates and ultimately won.
At some point, the Blackbeard Pirates expanded, and Augur became one of the
Ten Titanic Captains
, leading the third ship of the fleet.
The Blackbeard Pirates used their captain's knowledge of Whitebeard's former territory to conquer it. Now that Blackbeard had become an
Emperor
, the Blackbeard Pirates were hunting down powerful
Devil Fruit
users in order to absorb their abilities.
Kuzan parties with the Blackbeard Pirates after their initial encounter.
Afterwards, the crew arrives on an island in the New World, where some of them are frozen by former Admiral
Kuzan
. However, the latter and Teach start talking and drinking, so Kuzan gets rid of the freeze. As he celebrates, Augur overhears the conversations related to the fight between Kuzan and Sakazuki. The the crew tells Kuzan about the
Road Poneglyphs
that are needed to reach
Laugh Tale
, and "
the man with the Burn scar
" who is rumored to possess the fourth and final one. Then, upon hearing Lafitte suggest they steal his devil fruit, Kuzan starts freezing some of the crew again, but Teach managed to convince Kuzan to join the crew instead.

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
After
Koby
was abducted by the Blackbeard Pirates and taken to Hachinosu as a prisoner, Augur was present with his fellow Titanic Captains as Teach revealed a plan to use Koby as a bargaining chip in order for Hachinosu to be recognized as a country affiliated with the
World Government
.
Knowing that either
Law
,
Kid
, or
Luffy
would travel to
Winner Island
once they left
Wano
, Teach decided to wait there with, Augur,
Jesus Burgess
,
Doc Q
and
Stronger
to steal the copies of the Road Poneglyphs from whichever crew that would arrive. When they saw the
Polar Tang
of the
Heart Pirates
, they attacked it, blasting several holes in the sub's hull. At that moment, Augur teleported Burgess to the island.
During Teach's confrontation with Law, Augur tried to shoot the latter, but
Bepo
told
Jean Bart
, who shielded Law from the attack; here Augur then commented on Jean Bart's resistance. Meanwhile, he realized that Law hurt Teach; so Augur criticized his captain for having launched into a fight without a strategy. Likewise, he approached him and asked if they should retire, to which Teach refused.
Later the crew managed to defeat the Heart Pirates, leaving nearly all of them at sea along with the Polar Tang, sunk and destroyed. However, when Teach was thinking about what to do with Law's fruit, Bepo took a special drug made by
Chopper
that allows him to transform into
Sulong
without a
full moon
and attacked the crew, before swimming away, taking Law with him.
Auger and Devon meet Caribou.
Some time later after Law escaped, Augur and
Catarina Devon
made their way to the island of Egghead itself.
Following Luffy punching Saint
Jaygarcia Saturn
away, Devon and Augur made their move and confronted the Elder. Augur remained silent during Saturn's questioning on why they were there, but chose to respond when specifically asked what they hoped to achieve. Augur boldly stated that their overall goal was the
World
itself, prompting Saturn to attempt to attack them. Saturn's attack missed, as Augur teleported them away in time, although they remained on Egghead. When Devon asked why he hadn't teleported them further away, Augur stated that he hadn't mastered his ability yet. To Augur and Devon's bewilderment, an ecstatic
Caribou
approached the two, declaring himself a huge fan of the Blackbeard Pirates, and begging to be taken to see Blackbeard himself.
Augur seemed to know who he was but kept his rifle pointed as Caribou could still be a threat to Teach's life, Caribou pleaded with Augur and Devon to not kill him and to take him to meet Teach as he had valuable information on the locations of the
Ancient
Weapons
he would provide to the Emperor free of charge.
In the end, Augur and Devon decided to take Caribou with them, eventually making it back to their ship. Augur stood silently as Devon made a call to Blackbeard and Caribou begged for a chance to share his information.
Elbaph Arc
[
]
Later, Augur and Devon would arrive back on Hachinosu. While their ship was being docked, Caribou was terrified of
Avalo Pizarro
's
Devil Fruit
, much to their annoyance.
