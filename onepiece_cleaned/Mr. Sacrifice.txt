Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Sapoten Graveyard's official name revealed.
Igaram
refers to the graveyard as サボテン岩
(
saboten iwa
?
)
,
which can be translated as "Cactus Rock"; however, a sign is later seen showing that the name of the graveyard is "Sapoten Graveyard".
It is unclear if this is meant to be a translation of "
saboten iwa
", as "sapoten" is an incorrect romanization of "
saboten
" and "graveyard" is not a proper translation of "
iwa
", or if it is meant to be an alternate name for the graveyard.
