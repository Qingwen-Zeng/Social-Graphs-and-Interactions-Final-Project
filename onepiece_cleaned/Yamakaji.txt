Vice Admiral Yamakaji
is a
Marine
officer, and one of the five
vice admirals
who led the
Buster Call
on
Enies Lobby
.
Appearance
[
]
Yamakaji is a tall and broad-chested man. He has a slightly wrinkled face, a round nose with prominent nostrils, thick lips, and a wide, round chin. He has brown buzz cut-styled hair
which connects to a thick beard that covers his entire chin. He is always seen with his eyes closed and with a cigar in his mouth. He is also often seen with a cheerful smile. He wears a dark brown double-breasted suit with a black tie underneath, all over a yellow dress shirt with a red polka dot pattern. He also wears brown pants and brown shoes. Like most high-ranking
Marine
officers, he drapes his standard Marine coat over his shoulders like a cape. He also wears a standard Marine cap.
Twenty-seven years ago, his appearance was very similar. He lacked his beard, instead just having some stubble on his chin, as well as sideburns. He wore an orange suit and a red tie over a white dress shirt, and already had his Marine coat and cap at that time.
Personality
[
]
Yamakaji generally acts very nonchalant, such as when he was seen peacefully grinning while the
Marines
destroyed Enies Lobby. However, during the
Summit War of Marineford
, this demeanor slipped, and he was seen anxiously observing the war. Yamakaji appears to admire his senior officers. This is demonstrated when he was seen acting excited when he saw
Garp
and
Sengoku
working together, as well as when he acted protective of
Tsuru
during the Summit War of Marineford. Yamakaji likes to smoke so much that he even smokes during battle.
As a Marine, Yamakaji presumably has a strong sense of
justice
. He appears to be very obedient, to the point of not wanting to attack
Blackbeard
without receiving direct orders.
Abilities and Powers

]
As a
vice admiral
, Yamakaji is capable of commanding a

After a
Buster Call
had been ordered on

vice admirals
Momonga
,
Onigumo
,
Doberman
, and
Strawberry
were summoned to lead the attack against the
Straw Hat Pirates
and their allies.
After arriving, they began to bombard the island with cannon fire. Towards the end of the bombardment, Yamakaji is seen listening to the soldiers reporting on the destruction of the entire island other than the
Bridge of Hesitation
.
The cannon fire was then targeted on the Straw Hats and the Bridge of Hesitation, but they managed to escape out to sea. Though the island was successfully destroyed, the Buster Call was ultimately unsuccessful as none of the targets were killed.

admirals

He was also seen watching in distress as

was defeated by Luffy.

Wano Country Arc
[
]
After the dissolution of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, Yamakaji commanded a fleet of ships and two
Seraphim
to attack
Amazon Lily
and capture
Boa Hancock
. When the Marines managed to get through the gate leading to the village, he commented that the pirate did not want to come out. During the clashes, Blackbeard's crew arrived. Yamakaji's subordinates asked for orders to attack the Emperor, but he said they must have permission from headquarters to do so. Later, he and almost all of his subordinates (except for
Koby
) were
petrified
by Hancock. Thanks to the intervention of
Silvers Rayleigh
, Hancock freed everyone present from petrifaction, including Yamakaji.
Afterward, Yamakaji still had not received clearance to fight the Emperor, so the Blackbeard Pirates were able to abduct 800 Marine soldiers and one battleship. When Koby offered his life in their stead, Yamakaji tried to protest but stopped once he was informed that Koby was a member of
SWORD
. Blackbeard accepted the trade and took Koby prisoner, leaving the other Marines with Yamakaji.
