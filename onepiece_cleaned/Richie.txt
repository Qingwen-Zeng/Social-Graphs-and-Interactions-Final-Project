Appearance
[
]
Richie is a large lion that shows a fierce expression during fights and confrontations. However, he can also show a goofy face when he is not doing anything.
In the anime, his eye colors can sometimes change from white sclerae to scarlet red sclerae, or vice versa, depending on the animators. His eyes are usually white when he is in a comical or friendly mood, but red when he is in a vicious or enraged mood.
He has golden brown fur and a pink mane in the manga. In the anime, his fur is green and his mane is purple.
After the timeskip, he has gotten fatter, and wears a one-piece garment with white and orange rhombuses, and a
white frill collar
.
Personality
[
]
Despite his size and fierce look, Richie mostly acts like a kitten, having his own goofy moments when doing nothing. Richie is intelligent enough to adopt human-like mannerisms, but is otherwise not very bright and most of the time thinks only about food.
Sometimes, his own crewmates will mistake his melodramatic longings for food as though he felt moved by a sad or touching moment if such has just taken place.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being a large lion, Richie can fight by biting and mauling his victims. He is fairly strong, having enough biting force to destroy a thick iron cage that not even
Roronoa Zoro
thought he could cut down and being capable of knocking
Monkey D. Luffy
away through a wooden building with a single swipe of his paw.
However, being a wild and irrational beast and not very intelligent, Richie can easily be overpowered by opponents stronger and faster than him, as Luffy easily overpowered him by spinning him around. His gluttony is also a problem, as Richie can often be distracted from his goal if he is very hungry, as Usopp managed to distract him with his Tamago Boshi, which caused Richie to instantly calm down and start licking the egg.

He beat up Cabaji and Mohji (who had both been weakened from fighting each other) while sleep walking
and was declared the new captain.

Immediately after Buggy became a new
Warlord of the Sea
, the Buggy Pirates received the summons to fight against the
World Pirates
. Coincidentally, they happened to come upon the World Pirates' ship and saw that Luffy and Boa Hancock were fighting with Sebastian. Richie then followed the rest of the crew as they boarded the enemy ship. On board the ship, they watched as
Byrnndi World
defeated Luffy and then went to help revive him.
Later, they encountered
Gairam
who attacked them with his Devil Fruit powers. During the attack, while the rest of the crew were cheering on Buggy for his supposed words of encouragement to Luffy, Richie thought about ice cream. Then while the crew continued cheering and while Buggy was thinking about the Impel Down escapees' bounties being higher than his, Richie changed to thinking about curry on rice and then a melon. However, when Gairam began attacking again, the crew made a run for it while Mr. 3 fended off the attack. Eventually, however, Gairam is defeated by Hancock and the crew escaped outside the ship.
Outside, they saw a fleet of Marine ships approaching, which then began to fire on the World Pirates' ship. Buggy and his crew then make their withdrawal back to their own ship.
