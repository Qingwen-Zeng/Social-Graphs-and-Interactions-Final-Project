Appearance

Genbo is a fat, bald Shandia with a hat that resembles a chef's hat, but with dark yellow and white stripes on it. He wears a grass skirt, much like many of his comrades, and has a large belt with a big buckle hanging from over his left shoulder. His arms are covered by some sort of spotted, similar to that of a giraffe, fur-lined gloves reaching up to his neck, covering even the shoulders. He also has a standard pair of a Shandia's wings on his back.
After the timeskip he is seen to have slimmed down, wearing the coat his fellow guards are wearing fully buttoned with a large belt over it hanging from his left shoulder and the same hat he wore before the timeskip.
