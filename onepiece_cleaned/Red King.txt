History

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
When the
World Government
had ordered to eliminate
Vegapunk
, Red King, alongside
Jaygarcia Saturn
,
Kizaru
, and eight other
Vice Admirals
, led a Marine fleet to besiege the island of
Egghead
.
Before the attack, he instructed his subordinates to target the
Sea Beast Weapons
rather than the
Pacifista
under
Sentomaru
's control.
After Kizaru had infiltrated Egghead, Red King and the Marines fought back against the Pacifista and Sea Beast Weapons.
After the Marines made landfall, Red King and other high-ranking Marines attempted to seize Vegapunk after Saturn grabbed
Jewelry Bonney
, but were ordered by Saturn to stop since they could not escape.
Saturn then ordered a
Buster Call
on Egghead, prompting the Marines to evacuate. During the process, the Pacifista under Bonney's order started attacking the ships. Red King commanded the smaller ships to pull back and the larger battleships to shoot at the Pacifista.
Red King is defeated by Franky.
As the Vice Admirals switched their target to Bonney, Red King,
Guillotine
and
Pomsky
went to the island to stop her and her group from escaping to the
Giant Warrior Pirates
' ship.
Red King moved to attack
Franky
, who warned him not to get in their way. Red King refused, and was quickly defeated by Franky in a short battle.
In the aftermath of the
Egghead Incident
, Red King and the Vice Admirals met with Saturn. They apologized for their failure to stop the Straw Hats and wished to head after them to
Elbaph
, but Saturn advised them not to as their real concern was allowing Vegapunk's message to reach the world. Later, Red King became horrified upon witnessing Saturn suddenly withering away. Subsequently, Saturn's body exploded with only his skeleton remaining.
