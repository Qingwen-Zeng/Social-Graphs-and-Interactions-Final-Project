Emet
,
also known as the
Iron Giant
, is a legendary robot that attacked
Mary Geoise
200 years ago. It was originally created 900 years ago during the
Void Century
for a yet unknown purpose, and was a friend of
Joy Boy
. It was inactive due to running out of energy and is kept on
Egghead
.
After hearing the
Drums of Liberation
from
Monkey D. Luffy
, Emet powered back up,
during which it guarded
Vegapunk
's prerecorded video being broadcasted from within itself.
It is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Egghead Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Emet is a robot around as tall as the
Ancient Giants
. It wears a horned helmet, and its face and lower body are covered by grills with vertical bars. The left horn on its helmet broke off over two hundred years ago, and remains missing. Around the Void Century, it wore overalls with fur lining, which it no longer does since it attacked Mary Geoise. During the battle against the
Five Elders
,
Shepherd Ju Peter
bit off its left arm and a portion of the respective shoulder.

Personality
[
]
Despite being a machine, Emet does appear to be fully sentient and capable of emotion. He was very friendly and loyal to
Joy Boy
, liking his company and intending to make him king of something.
After waking up from its slumber, it apologized to Joy Boy for failing his original mission and then started looking for him out of nostalgia.
Relationships
[
]
Joy Boy
[
]
While the full relationship between Emet and Joy Boy is yet to be revealed, it seems that Emet was someone very dear to Joy Boy to the point that he would always want to protect it even after he is long gone. Joy Boy even gave Emet a knot that contained his most powerful Haki, so the robot could use it to protect itself or someone dear to it from mortal danger.
Emet in turn reciprocated this feeling, as when it awoke during the
Egghead Incident
, it apologized to Joy Boy for failing to make him king. In fact, when the robot heard the
Drums of Liberation
for the first time after many centuries, it went to look for Joy Boy because it recognized the rhythm as the sound that Joy Boy would make. Even after finding out that the rhythm no longer belonged to Joy Boy but someone
else
, Emet still sided with the person and fought alongside them. During its last moments before powering down, Emet was seen happily reminiscing the time that Joy Boy gave him the knot.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
The full extent of its abilities is currently unknown as it ran out of energy before causing damage. However, it was able to climb the
Red Line
and was considered to be far beyond the scientific knowledge of the time. It later served as inspiration for
Vegapunk
's
Vegaforce-01
, however, he was unable to replicate the mysterious
Ancient Energy
(
古代のエネルギー
,
Kodai no Enerugī
?
)
power source of the Iron Giant.

The "
Drums of Liberation
" are somehow able to power it up, although it is still unknown how exactly this happens. Its armor is extremely tough, providing it protection from explosions and high temperatures, as it was witnessed wandering through a massive fire and relentless bombardment from a
Buster Call
while seemingly unbothered.
Despite being easily knocked away into the sea by
Topman Warcury
, once Emet fully recognized Luffy as Joy Boy, the robot recovered instantly and jumped out of the ocean despite its weight and size, and punched Warcury with enough force to break off one of his tusks and cause the Elder to bleed, effectively dealing damage to his tremendous hide that not even Luffy while in his
Gear 5
form was able to achieve.
Luffy
determined that it is supposed to move autonomously, as he could not find a place for people to pilot it from the inside.
This deduction was shown to be true as Emet could move and think for itself independently.
Emet has its own voice, but so far has only been shown to be understood by those who can hear the
Voice of All Things
.
Weapons
[
]
It is shown to be wielding a
polearm
of some sort during its attack on Mary Geoise. It apparently once had some form of weapons mounted on its arms, although the years it spent in ruins made them inoperable.
Haki Knot
[
]
The man known as Joy Boy once sealed a portion of his
Supreme King Haki
within Emet, which could be released by untying a knot somewhere on its body.
Due to possessing Joy Boy's Haki, Emet was capable of releasing it in a large burst all at once. The Haki was potent enough to travel for a long distance outside of Egghead and cancel the
Devil Fruit
transformation powers of the
Five Elders
, but was considered a one-time use weapon to be utilized in dire circumstances, with Emet deciding to unleash it at the end of the
Egghead Arc
.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Before Void Century
[
]
Emet has a meeting with Joy Boy.
Emet was originally created roughly 900 years ago.
At some point, it became acquainted with
Joy Boy
and became his comrade. Eventually, Joy Boy told Emet about a certain eventuality where he wouldn't be there to protect him, hence he sealed his Conqueror's Haki inside Emet's chassis as a means to protect him and the ones who Emet wants to protect should the need ever arise. This made Emet happy, knowing that a part of Joy Boy would live on inside him long after he was gone.
Attack on Mary Geoise
[
]
Emet attacks Mary Geoise.
200 years ago, Emet suddenly appeared out of nowhere and attacked
Mary Geoise
, but ran out of energy before causing damage. The
World Government
subsequently ordered a group of
scientists
to destroy it, but
Jaygarcia Saturn
secretly commanded the scientists to hide and study it instead.
It eventually fell into the hands of
Vegapunk
.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
Emet was accidentally discovered by
Luffy
,
Chopper
,
Jinbe
, and
Bonney
during their stay on
Egghead
.
Luffy attempted to climb inside the robot but was unable to, determining that it was the type that moved by itself. They were then interrupted by
Vegapunk
, who had gotten himself stuck while warping through the giant's outer armor. The scientist then explained its history.

During Luffy's battle against
Kizaru
, he activated
Gear 5
, which led to the Drums of Liberation reaching the Iron Giant, causing its eyes to light up.
When Luffy later activated his Gear 5 form again, the Drums of Liberation triggered the Iron Giant to start moving.
Fully awake, Emet walked through the flames from the
Buster Call
and mentally apologized to
Joy Boy
.
As the Iron Giant continued to make its way across Egghead,
Marines
surrounding the island attempted to bombard it. Despite the heavy bombing, the giant was undeterred, and continued on its route with little issue.
York
later determined that Emet was protecting the
Den Den Mushi
that Vegapunk was using to broadcast his world-wide message.

After hearing York's theory, the
Five Elders
(save for
Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro
), dropped all of their previous tasks and moved in on the Iron Giant. After successfully locating and surrounding it, the Elders recognized it as the very same machine that had attacked Mary Geoise 200 years prior. After hearing Vegapunk begin to make his announcement on the meaning of the letter "D.",
Topman Warcury
moved in and attacked the Iron Giant, resulting in the broadcast cutting out, and the machine collapsing.
The giant ended up falling into the sea and sinking down to the ocean floor while wondering about Joy Boy's whereabouts. It later reacted to the Drums of Liberation caused by another of Luffy's transformations, finally identifying his position.
Remembering something Joy Boy said to it earlier, Emet suddenly emerged from the sea and punched Warcury, breaking one of his tusks and stopping the Elder from smashing into the
Giant Warrior Pirates
' ship.
Emet's arm is bitten off by Peter.
After managing to fully reemerge from the sea, Emet was finally able to speak with Luffy, whom it called Joy Boy. Luffy heard its voice through the
Voice of all things
and its intentions to assist, although Luffy did not understand why or that it was an ally. Emet then prepared to use one of its weapons, although this failed, due to age making them inoperable. Due to the failure, one of Emet's arms was bitten off by
Shepherd Ju Peter
, although it was able to remain standing, and stood in the way of the Elders.
Emet was soon struck again by Warcury and received significant damage. Apologizing to Luffy for mistaking him for Joy Boy, Emet asked the young pirate for his name. Upon hearing that Luffy was a carrier of the
Will of D.
, Emet thanked him for letting it hear the Drums of Liberation one last time, and released a massive burst of
Supreme King Haki
that was sealed inside its chassis by Joy Boy ages ago. As the burst of Haki forced the Five Elders back to
Mary Geoise
, Emet thought of a time it spoke to Joy Boy before powering down.
