Clapp before he was enslaved.
Clapp was a large, stout man with an impressive physique, much like his son Kuma.
His face featured a prominent, square jaw with some stubble at the chin, a wide, bulbous nose and dark squared eyebrows. His dark hair was short and wavy.
After being enslaved and abused, Clapp lost his left eye at some point, leaving only a stitched scar running down the upper portion of his face in its place.  He also received another stitched scar on his left forearm. Like all slaves of the World Nobles, Clapp had the Hoof of the Soaring Dragon burned into him to mark him as "less than human".
Personality

Clapp was a dedicated family man who loved his wife and child. Even after being enslaved and then heartbroken about the death of his wife, he kept looking out for Kuma.
As a buccaneer, Clapp believed in
Nika
, the slave liberator who was part of his race's folklore, and liked to share legends about him with his son.

Biography
[
]
Around 47 years ago, Clapp and his wife managed a
church
in the
Sorbet Kingdom
and had their first child,
Kuma
. Their happiness was short-lived, as the
World Government
was monitoring the island for
Buccaneers
and learned about their existence through the hospital that helped with Kuma's delivery. In spite of Clapp's begging for the government to leave his wife and kid alone, they were all enslaved when Kuma was 4 years old and sent to Mary Geoise, with Clapp receiving the brunt of the abuse.
At some point, Clapp's wife passed away and he had to tearfully tell his son about it. In order to keep Kuma's mood up, he started sharing stories about a prominent legend of Buccanner folklore, the warrior of liberation
Nika
. While giving Kuma more details about the legend and entertaining him, Clapp was suddenly shot by an annoyed World Noble, dying in front of his son as a result.
Legacy

Because of the way he suffered for his
race
his son, Kuma, did not want to bring misery to those close to him like
Ginny
.
