Appearance
[
]
Kamakirigirl is a tall, slender woman. Her clothing is relatively limited, only wearing up two pieces of purple metal breastplated armor with shoulder guards, a purple thong, purple boots, and kneepads. Her hair is pink, and like most other Gifters, she has a pair of small, black horns on her head. On her arms are multiple circular tattoos. Due to her SMILE, her hands are replaced with massive, curved blades, similar to a praying mantis.
Personality
[
]
Kamakirigirl is quite ambitious, and is willing to act on her ambitions, even setting out to sea in an attempt to become
Pirate King
. Despite her ambitions, however, she appears to be a realist, recognizing that she could not defeat
Kaidou
.
She either has a tendency to "take the easy way out", even using that line of reasoning to attempt and convince
Roronoa Zoro
to follow in her footsteps and submit to Kaidou, or she has thoroughly accepted her submission, and fully given up on her ambitions. Either way, since she joined the
Beasts Pirates
, she has adopted the belief that everybody should follow Kaidou's rule.
In the anime, she is particularly cruel, calling the revolting
Waiters
and
Pleasures
"washed-up trash" and stating they should be "beaten up and kicked out".

During the
Raid on Onigashima
, Kamakirigirl confronted
Roronoa Zoro
alongside
Nokokuwa Police
and
Beetleman
. She tried to convince him to submit to
Kaidou
and join the
Beasts Pirates
, reassuring him that many of the crew's members once tried to become
Pirate King
themselves.
At some point during the Raid, she was fed one of
Tama's
Kibi Kibi no Mi
dango, turning her traitor against the Beasts Pirates.
Kamakirigirl was later seen trapped in the Castle Basement by the fire alongside other members of the Alliance.
