History

Past
[
]
Thirty years ago, Kingdew was with the
Whitebeard Pirates
when they arrived for the first time at
Wano Country
. The crew was shipwrecked and before going to civilization to get supplies, they encountered
Kouzuki Oden
, who asked
Whitebeard
to let him join their crew after a brief clash.
The Whitebeard Pirates later had a feast with Oden and his retainers. Oden kept asking to join the crew, but he was turned down. Two weeks later, the Whitebeard Pirates tried to leave Wano without Oden. As they were leaving, the crew was surprised when Oden wrapped a chain around the
Moby Dick
's mast and got dragged with the ship. As Oden held onto the chain,
Izou
was also holding on to Oden and got dragged with him. After Izou was pulled up onboard, Oden accepted Whitebeard's challenge of holding onto the chain for three days before he could be accepted into the crew. For the next three days, the crew watched how Oden withstood his ordeal. When Oden had an hour left to complete the challenge, the crew started cheering for him. After Oden was accepted into the crew, the Whitebeard Pirates had adventures with him as well as
Toki
, whom Oden helped, and
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
, who had stowed away on the ship.
