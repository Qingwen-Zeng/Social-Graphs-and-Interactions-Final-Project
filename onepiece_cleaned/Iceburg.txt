Personality
[
]
Iceburg in a carefree mood.
Iceburg is the mayor of Water 7 as well as president of the Galley-La Company, and thus the most important person in the city. However, he is by no means haughty: on his first appearance, he personally accompanied Luffy, Usopp and Nami around Dock 1, showing them the place, and he was seen talking informally and with pleasure with one of the shipwrights in his employ. Both his subordinates and his citizens show an incredible amount of respect and admiration for him, so it could be assumed that he's an excellent leader.
Iceburg at times seems to act rather childish, canceling all of his meetings so that he can show people around, refusing to meet with people because he does not like them, finding animals on the ground and taking care of them, and other such behaviors. (He currently has a mouse that he named "
Tyrannosaurus
"). However, when the time comes, he can be very serious, and it becomes clear that his childishness is only when he is relaxed. He also has a tendency to say, "Nmaa" or "Oh my" ("Mwell" in the FUNimation dub) whenever he talks.
Iceburg is a person who is against making weapons because he believes they are meant to hurt people even if the person who made them has no ill intent as shown when he kept telling Franky to stop making his battleships during their younger years. Similarly, he stated to Robin that even if what she was seeking was indeed just the history of the world, it wouldn't be worth it if it ran the risk of awakening the Ancient Weapons.
As a shipwright, Iceburg has a deep understanding and sympathy for ships, as he saw the
Going Merry
was well taken care of despite the accumulated terminal damage it has incurred. He complied with the ship's plea to repair it for one more journey despite not fully knowing if the voice was real and that it was already beyond any hope, and upon witnessing Merry sailing on its own, Iceburg was determined to see this miracle up close that he would risk sailing through the
Aqua Laguna
.
Relationships
[
]
Galley-La Company
[
]
Iceburg is the beloved mayor of the people of
Water 7
, especially by all of his workers. They enjoy his company and often ask for his opinion and input on anything having to do with building ships. They are very protective of Iceburg as they sought retribution when Iceburg was harmed and they will fight to defend him.
Tyrannosaurus
[
]
Iceburg's pet Tyrannosaurus.
He is very attached to his pet mouse
Tyrannosaurus
, who can always be seen with him, usually in his left breast pocket.
Tom's Workers
[
]
Tom
[
]
As his mentor, Tom held a great amount of importance to Iceburg. He was trained as a shipwright from a young age by Tom, and respected him and his skills immensely. Iceburg worked with Tom and Franky on the Sea Train. When Tom gave himself up to the World Government, Iceburg was seen crying.
Franky
[
]
Iceburg was the one who gave him the nickname "Franky" because he thought Cutty Flam was a weird name; later, when he passed on the Pluton blueprints, he was the one who asked Franky to use only that name to protect himself from anyone who would want to steal the plans. His relationship with Franky is strange at times as he has never really understood Franky's often weird antics, and Franky was prone to calling him "Baka-berg" or "Ahoberg" at times, "Baka" and "Aho" being the Japanese words for "idiot" or "moron" or something similar;Â the English dub changed this to "Ice for brains". Likewise, Iceburg called him "Bakanky", a portmanteau of "Baka" and "Franky", changed to "Flunky" in the English dub. His original goal to build a ship strong enough to kill a Sea King was always shunned by Iceburg who did not understand why he kept building his weird and potentially dangerous ships. When the Battle Franky's were used to hurt the innocent, Iceburg was very angry at Franky. Since then, however, Iceburg has forgiven Franky for the part his Battle Frankys played in the framing of Tom, and despite the differences between Iceburg and Franky, the two former apprentices of Tom are still the best of friends. Iceburg was relieved to the point of tears to find out Franky was alive after he was brutally hit by the Sea Train, and likewise, Franky was utterly enraged with CP9 after they told him Iceburg was supposedly dead. Iceburg was also the only person aware that Franky's grief towards Tom's death was the real reason behind Franky's actions in Water 7 and why he refused to leave. In the end, Iceburg was able to help Franky overcome that grief by helping him realize he needed to forgive himself, enabling Franky to join the Straw Hat Pirates.
Kokoro
[
]
During his time as Tom's apprentice, Kokoro served as a matronly figure to Iceburg and Franky. Iceburg maintained a relationship with Kokoro after Tom's arrest and Franky's presumed death, spending many years meeting up together as drinking buddies.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Iceburg is the Mayor of Water 7 and the CEO of Galley-La, the company he united together single-handedly, overall giving him complete control over the island.
Carpentry
[
]
Having been personally taught by Tom, who was hailed as the greatest shipwright of his time, Iceburg is a brilliant shipwright like Franky. He was able to unite all the shipyards of Water 7 under his leadership to form the Galley-La Company, which is an organization of the finest shipwrights in the world. Iceburg later became one of the five who crafted the
Thousand Sunny
for the
Straw Hat Pirates
. His skills in naval architecture were already evident in his youth, when he helped in the construction of the
Sea Train
with Tom. He was also able to repair the failed prototype Sea Train Rocketman in time for the Straw Hats to use it to get to Enies Lobby within a short period of time, as well as fixing the
Going Merry
, which was already badly damaged beyond repair, to usable condition by himself in the midst of
Aqua Laguna
while still injured by the attack from the CP9. His understanding of naval architecture is great enough that he intends to convert the very city of Water 7 into a giant floating boat to overcome the future problems of Aqua Laguna.
Physical Abilities
[
]
He has proven at different times to have great endurance and resistance, as seen when he was able to stand up after he and Tom endured a bombardment from the fleet of
Battle Franky
ships, which were powerful enough to kill a Sea King, and when he went to the station to check the Rocketman after receiving severe injuries from the CP9.
Weapons
[
]
He was seen wielding a
flintlock pistol
against
Luffy
and
Nico Robin
, although he was unable to harm either of them.
History

Past
[

The Apprentice Years
[
]
Iceburg was an apprentice of the
fish-man
Tom, the legendary shipwright of Water 7 along with
Cutty Flam
, another young boy a few years younger than himself. The two apprentices were constantly arguing with each other since all Franky wanted to do was build a weird ship that could take down a
Sea King
while Tom laughed at their antics. Before Roger became the Pirate King, Tom's Workers were visited by the Roger Pirates.
Tom's Workers celebrate finishing the Puffing Tom.
One day, Tom was put in front of a jury for building the
Oro Jackson
, the ship of the late Pirate King
Gol D. Roger
. Tom was given 10 years to complete his plans for the "Sea Train" to be pardoned for his crime. Iceburg believed Tom was completely innocent of building the ship and decided to work his hardest to aid Tom while Franky continued to build his ships.
Finally, the day came for Tom to be pardoned. With the Sea Train working and Water 7 now enjoying a burgeoning trade business, things looked fine. However unfortunately,
Spandam
stole a fleet of Franky's unmistakable battleships and attacked the jury team, slipping away quickly once the job was done, but not after having attacked Tom and Iceburg as well. All of Tom's workers were arrested and accused of trying to attack the jury ship. Since Tom was granted a pardon for his previous crime, he choose to have the attack pardoned to save his apprentices from being charged as accomplices and announced he was proud to have built Gol D. Roger's ship.
After Tom was taken away in the very Sea Train he had built, news came back to Iceburg and
Kokoro
that Cutty Flam had died, having attempted to stop the Sea Train from taking Tom away. Iceburg, now the only survivor of the company, inherited the position of guarding the blueprints to
Pluton
.
The Rise to Prominence
[
]
Iceburg takes on a prominent role in Water 7.
As he was considered the only surviving assistant to Tom, Iceburg saw himself as the only one who could carry out Tom's dream of transforming Water 7. He proceeded to unite all shipyards in Water 7 under one company, the Galley-La Company. With all the best shipwrights working together, he built up a worldwide corporation and became a purveyor for the World Government. After gaining support from the whole city, Iceburg would take on role of Mayor. With this position came the notion that he had become an indispensable and upstanding citizen, and simply getting rid of Iceburg by illicit means was no longer an option for the government. With this, the blueprints of Pluton were once again safe, at least for the moment.
Return of an Old Friend
[
]
Iceburg meets with Franky for the first time in 4 years.
Iceburg was the holder of the blueprints to
Pluton
for four years after
Tom
's death. After that time had passed,
Cutty Flam
, his friend who he believed to be long-dead, made a reappearance. Cutty Flam attempted to meet Iceburg at his Galley La office, giving his name to the secretary,
Kalifa
. Iceburg denied a public meetup, and instead met with him that night at Tom's old warehouse. Tom was shocked at Cutty Flam's new appearance, and was appalled when Cutty Flam attempted to shift the blame of Tom's death solely to the government. Iceburg declared that he would never forgive Cutty Flam, but desired his help in hiding Pluton's blueprints. He informed Cutty Flam that he was legally dead as far as the government was concerned, and encouraged him to drop the name in favor of going by "Franky", as none would assume him. He also told Franky that he had to leave Water 7 in order to ensure that the blueprints would never be found. While eventually accepting the role as holder of the blueprints, Franky's pride and Tom's death made him outright refuse to leave the city. Although he was angered by Franky's decision, Iceburg relented and burst into tears, overwhelmed with the fact one of his best friends was still alive. As a result, the blueprints secretly left Iceburg's possession, although the government still suspected him.
Stalked by the Government
[
]
After years of being stalked by government officers for the Pluton plans, the strongest division of the Cipher Pol were secretly sent for Iceburg. Without him knowing, four of the CP9 agents infiltrated Water 7 and disguised themselves to look like normal people, several even gaining entry into his trusted inner circle.
He would also be hounded by the government official
Corgi
, although he simply feigned ignorance of the blueprints.
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
While on his way to Dock 1, Iceburg was informed by Kalifa on
Mikazuki
refusing to pay, commenting on the troublesome nature of the client. A little later, the infamous
Straw Hat Pirates
docked at Water 7, with the intention of getting
their ship
repaired.
Iceburg learned of the identities of the crew through a report by Kalifa, yet was undeterred by the status as pirates. After hearing about a number of mayoral duties he had that day, Iceburg complained and stated that he didn't feel like doing any of them, resulting in Kalifa simply canceling them all. The Straw Hats were left in disbelief about his use of his status. Kalifa attempted to discipline them for disrespecting Iceburg, but ended up mostly harming him in the process. The Straw Hats then gave Iceburg a letter from Kokoro, which he accepted, and offered them a tour of the dock while
Kaku
inspected their ship.
Sometime later, Kaku returned from his inspection of the ship, and revealed that in the ship's current condition, it would be an impossible fix.
Luffy was shocked and dismayed by the report, leading to Iceburg insult his status as captain. Iceburg then informed Luffy that his crew had plenty of money to purchase a new ship, and to come back if he wanted one. Before he could leave, he was confronted by Corgi, forcing him to meet with the government agent despite his obvious disdain.
The meeting went as it usually did, with Iceburg rejecting Corgi, to the official's chagrin.
While sleeping in the
Galley-La Headquarters
, Iceburg was almost shot to death.
The next morning, he revealed that the one who shot him was none other than
Nico Robin
of the Straw Hat Pirates, along with a masked man.
Upon learning this, the
Galley-La Company
workers came to the conclusion that the Straw Hat Pirates were the assassins, and began to actively seek them out. To prevent any more assassination attempts on Iceburg, the entire force of Galley-La's workers guarded Iceburg closely, while searching for the Straw Hats.
Iceburg heard that Luffy was in the building and told Kalifa to find him and send him to his room. When Luffy came to Iceburg's room, the pirate immediately questioned if it Robin was the actual attempted assassin. Iceburg confirmed Luffy's worst fear, before pointing his gun at Luffy and requesting that Luffy hand over Robin, immediately. Luffy replied that he had no idea of where she was. As a result, Iceburg shot him, but Luffy did not get hurt due to being a
rubber man
. The sound of the gun prompted the main shipwrights to go to Iceburg's room, but Luffy had already escaped.
Robin holds Iceburg at gunpoint.
Later that night, the foremen of Galley-La Dock 1: Paulie, Lucci, Kaku and
Tilestone
guard Iceburg's room. During this time, he tasked Paulie with retrieving the fake Pluton blueprints from his vault. A little later, a huge explosion occurred in the headquarters, and masked individuals entered the building. During this time, his guards were easily defeated, and he was confronted once again by Robin. In their short conversation, Iceburg pulled a pistol and accused Robin of intending to destroy the world, due to her ability to read the Poneglyphs. As a result, Robin lashed out and held him at gunpoint, but in response, he simply stated that it was she and her friends who were deceived.
Iceburg is interrogated by CP9.
Three more masked people suddenly entered the room and revealed themselves to be not only CP9, but also people that Iceburg trusted the most: Lucci, Kalifa, Kaku, and bartender Blueno.
Lucci explained their role and the government's reasoning for seeking the blueprints, leaving Iceburg disgusted with the idea of people being killed in the name of
Justice
. Not willing to rely on a word-based confession, Lucci had Kaku restrain Iceburg and check his pulse. Lucci went on to explain his theory about Cutty Flam and Franky being the same person, causing Iceburg's pulse to rise, and giving away the only information that was keeping them from taking his life.
Iceburg and Paulie are saved by Chopper.
However, before the agents could take his life or leave to find Franky, the Straw Hats broke into the room, attempting to save Iceburg. Unfortunately for Iceburg, they were quickly dispatched by the agents without issue. Before leaving, Robin revealed her intentions to permanently abandon the Straw Hats for her goal. Iceburg accused her of being insane for trusting the government, but was quickly silenced.
As another bomb exploded, CP9 left Iceburg, Paulie, and the remaining Straw Hats to their deaths.
However, at the last moment, Chopper managed to regain consciousness and used the rest of his strength to leap through the window, landing outside, and saving everyone's lives.
After waking up, Iceburg took Nami aside and revealed Robin's true intentions, of which she had told him while Blueno was fighting Tilestone. He stated that if Robin did not obey CP9, they would use the World Government's most terrible attack force, the
Buster Call
, to destroy Water 7, and frame the Straw Hats, making them be judged at the judiciary island,
Enies Lobby
. But if she did obey them, the crew would be able to leave Water 7 safely. The Straw Hats then resolve to rescue Robin, as they get the help of
Peepley Lulu
, Tilestone, Paulie,
Kokoro
,
Chimney
,
Gonbe
, and the Franky Family.
Knowing the craft he helped create would be their only hope to pass
Aqua Laguna
, Iceburg prepared the prototype sea-train,
Rocketman
which the group could use to leave Water 7. As he looked on, they took off into the storm venturing for Enies Lobby.
Iceburg finds the Going Merry.
Before he could head to high ground to take shelter from the Aqua Laguna, he heard someone's voice calling out to him for help. He looked around and saw none, but then realized that the one calling out to him was the Straw Hat's ship, Going Merry. The ship asked for a second chance to help its friends, and begged Iceburg to repair it. Iceburg, still suffering from gunshot wounds, used his peerless shipwright skills to let the Going Merry sail once more. The waves took the ship off out to sea, as the Going Merry gratefully thanked him. Shocked and surprised to see this miracle, Iceburg requested a ship to follow to see it up close for himself, despite the dangers of the upcoming tidal wave, and his subordinates followed him.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
The next day, with the Aqua Laguna lifted, Iceburg sailed the
Galley-La Company ship
in the direction of Enies Lobby to look for the Straw Hats and the others. He found them in the miracle ship, Going Merry, after they successfully rescued Robin, whom he caught eyes with and appeared to still hold some distrust towards. Just as they met, however, the Going Merry broke apart straight down to the keel, and Iceburg recognized it as the moment of the ship's death. Iceburg watched as the Straw Hats gave the Merry a Viking funeral, remaining quiet as they shed tears.
Post Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Iceburg builds the Thousand Sunny alongside Franky.
The recent
Aqua Laguna
and its devastating impact on Water 7 gave Iceburg the desire to make Water 7 into a boat and float it on the water. Before he started working on it, he helped Franky build the dream ship for the Straw Hats. As they completed it, Iceburg suggested that the ship would be "the ship that will cross a thousand seas under the sun's light, the
Thousand Sunny
"! As the Straw Hats laid eyes on the new ship, Iceburg explained the situation with Franky and his absence, how he still felt obligated to remain on Water 7 (out of a duty to Tom, whose imprisonment and subsequent death Franky blamed himself for) and that only through force would Franky join. After much swim briefs hijinks and testicle clutching, Iceburg told Franky he forgave him, as well as Tom, and all that was left was for him to forgive himself. Franky started to cry, and in the end, Franky agreed to join the Straw Hat Pirates, to make his dream to sail on the dream ship become a reality.
