Zombies
are corpses capable of self-movement and other sentient actions. Well-known in superstitions and literature throughout the
world
, they can be created in actuality through at least one method: infusing corpses with shadows via the
Kage Kage no Mi
.
Gecko Moria
, the current wielder of the Kage Kage no Mi, is known to have created over one thousand zombies as subordinates. The vast majority of these inhabited his island-ship of
Thriller Bark
, and comprised a mix of
humans
, wildlife, and
strange creatures
that resembled beasts and monsters commonly found in mythology and horror stories. To create more powerful zombies, Moria enlisted the services of Dr.
Hogback
, who used his medical expertise to enhance them into stiched up creations he called
marios
(
没人形
,
Mario
?
, literally meaning "Death Doll"; VIZ and Funimation dub: "Marionettes")
.
The zombies of Thriller Bark were commanded by the
Mysterious Four
, which consisted of Moria, Dr. Hogback,
Absalom
, and
Perona
. While Hogback, Absalom, and Perona had a varying degree of command over the creatures, Moria alone had absolute control over all of the zombies.
The zombies remained active for a span of at least ten years after the establishment of Thriller Bark. However, while battling the
Straw Hat Pirates
, Moria implanted the shadows of his zombie army within himself as a last ditch effort to defeat the Straw Hats and their allies. Without any shadows animating them, the corpses all became lifeless once again.
Overview
[
]
A strong shadow combined with a strong corpse can create an even stronger zombie.
Basic zombies are created by the power of Moria's Kage Kage no Mi. First, Moria captures a victim. Using his
Devil Fruit
powers, Moria grabs a hold of the victim's shadow and cuts it from the owner using a pair of scissors. Moria then forms a contract of obedience with the shadow and implants it into a corpse.
A zombie created through this process retains the personality and fighting techniques of the person whom the shadow originally belonged to. The zombie's physical strength, however, depends on the body used. When a strong shadow and a strong corpse are combined, an even stronger zombie is created. For this reason, during Moria's rule over Thriller Bark, Hogback collected and stitched together hundreds of corpses to make strong creatures. This was best seen via the Zombie Generals, whose bodies were created from the various remains of famous warriors.
Zombies made with shadows of people of high levels of strength can be difficult to control at first, but they eventually fall in line. While initially retaining the personality of the shadow's owner, the zombie will eventually even disregard that person's heartfelt beliefs and solemn oaths as they fall into total obedience. For example,
Inuppe
, the zombie with
Sanji
's shadow, initially upheld Sanji's oath to never harm a lady and even attacked his fellow zombies when they tried to attack
Nami
. Later that same night, he attacked
Nico Robin
without giving her gender a second thought.
The victim whose shadow was stolen falls into a two-day coma. The only known way to awaken them early is to coax them awake with their personal vices. Even though separated, the person and the shadow are still a single being, meaning that if the person dies, their shadow will die as well, along with the zombie the shadow was placed inside of. Because of this, Moria prefers that his victims remain alive. During his rule over Thriller Bark, he had his victims placed back onto their ships and set adrift to ensure that they survived while remaining unable to come back and retake their shadows.
Though there were a lot of zombies on Thriller Bark, they would sometimes need to be replaced. This would happen when the original owners of the shadows animating them died, when Moria removed their shadows himself, or when the zombies were "purified" by ingesting salt, which caused their shadow to fly out and return to its original owner. To replace these losses, newer zombies were created from the entire corpses or individual body parts of the older zombies that were lost.
Overall Strength
[
]
While a zombie inherits the skills and memories of the shadow animating them, they do not inherit any Devil Fruit powers if the shadow belonged to a Devil Fruit user. Moria, can make up for their inability to perform any Devil Fruit based attacks to an extent by implanting his own shadow into the zombie's shadow. From there, he can manipulate the zombie's shape via a reverse form of shadow puppetry called
Kage Kakumei
.
Zombies are completely impervious to conventional methods such as beheading. Though some of them sometimes act like they are in pain when hit or feel tired as if they lost stamina, all zombies are actually immune to such things. When a zombie expresses such things it is not because they are in pain or tired, it is because the shadow animating them still remembers such feelings when they were originally attached to their original owners. Eventually, these memories of feeling pain and such will be completely forgotten thus rendering any zombie capable of functioning without expressing such things at all. Zombies are thus tireless creations who seemingly cannot be stopped no matter how hard or how long one fights against them.
While zombies seem to be unbeatable creatures, they do have weaknesses. When salt is thrown into a zombie's mouth, the shadow moving the corpse is detached and the zombie is purified. Because salt is a property of sea water and since the shadow was attached due to a Devil Fruit power, the shadow is naturally released. Though depending on the size of the zombie (eg. Oars) a bag of salt isn't enough to purify the zombie. A zombie's body may also be burned in order to release the shadow, as seen when Zoro set the samurai Ryuma alight, returning Brook's shadow to him once the body had finished burning. Zombies also remain "alive" as long the person whose shadow they use remains alive. If the person dies, so will his shadow. According to Brook, this is because the shadow and the person, though separated, are still of one soul. For this, Moria and his associates ensure that their victims will not die.
Another weakness could be attributed as an error by the zombie's creator. The zombies strength are based on putting strong shadows into stronger Mario's to create the strongest zombies. However should the creators misjudge the strength of the original shadow's owner, they may actually place the shadow in a weaker corpse, thus creating a zombie which is inferior to the original. An example would be
Inuppe
, who possessed
Sanji
's shadow. Though Sanji is a fighter with strength comparable to
Zoro
, due to the confusion caused by his
Wanted Poster
, they mistook him for a grunt and put his shadow in an ill-suited Wild Zombie. Even though Inuppe possessed all the other strengths of a zombie, due to having a stubby body unsuited to wield Sanji's
Black Leg Style
, it actually fell short of Sanji's full potential.
While a zombie's greatest strength is being not able to feel pain, it is also their greatest weak point. Because a zombie is unable to feel pain, they are unable gauge how badly damaged their body can or has become in a battle. This action inadvertently leads to their downfall as they would continue fighting non-stop without taking any time to heal or fix their wounds. With this, their wounds can build up and become massive, and can eventually cause a zombie to become unable to move their body at all. They can still function even when their bodies are completely broken. However, they can no longer fight despite still having the will to do so.
Types of Zombies
[
]
Wild Zombies
[
]
Wild Zombies in Thriller Bark's Woods.
Wild Zombies
(
動物
ゾンビ
,
Wairudo Zonbi
?
, literally meaning "Animal Zombies")
are zombies that consist of mainly stitched-up animals that are far less dead-like compared to the other zombies of Thriller Bark. They are capable of talking and are mostly commanded by
Perona
. Most of them are zombies created by Hogback based on Perona's stuffed toys per her request. A number of these were first seen by
Nami
,
Usopp
, and
Chopper
lurking in the woods.
Later, a large number of them waylaid Usopp, Nami, and Chopper in Perona's garden after they escaped from their transport coffin.
The animals, upon seeing them free, attempted to capture them. They were however stopped by the new penguin zombie. After being beaten several times by the dog penguin, they were commanded by Absalom, who had arrived there, to not harm Nami. They replied to him saying that they only obey Perona per Moria's order. They however decide to back down as Absalom reminds them to fear him also as he takes out the dog penguin.
Despite being animals, they fight with normal weapons such as swords, axes, and maces.
Soldier Zombies
[
]
Soldier Zombies rising from their graves.
The zombies serving as the basic grunt soldiers of Moria's army are the
Soldier Zombies
(
兵士
ゾンビ
,
Sorujā Zonbi
?
)
. They are generally commanded by
Absalom
but can be ordered around by other members of the Mysterious Four as well, such as Perona. They have great respect for their leader, Absalom, however, they are not afraid to tell him that he is a pervert, much to his dismay. They are found throughout Thriller Bark but a large number of them reside in the graveyard in front of the Mast Mansion.
Though most of the Soldier Zombies are generally grunts with no distinguishing traits other than design, there are some that stand out more than others. Cindry appears to belong to this group of zombies, even though she seems somewhat different from them both in design and mannerisms. Moria's little errand zombies, Gyoro, Nin, and Bao, naturally fall under this category; however, they're more like helpers rather than grunt soldiers.
A group of Soldier Zombies that reside in the graveyard attacked the carriage Nami, Usopp, and Chopper were in after Hildon and his companions left them.
A great number of these have been seen with numbers either printed on their bodies or on arm bands. The numbers from 408, to 767 have been seen on these creatures.
These zombies apparently have distinct personalities of sorts. They are apparently helpful to one another as seen when Chopper knocked one zombie's head off and another handed it back to him. The zombies are afraid of fire and in reply called Usopp a pyromaniac for attacking them with a fire star. Despite normally limping and moaning around like typical zombies, they are capable of running at great speeds. Unfortunately, they tire out easily.
Later, the rest of the Straw Hats encountered these creatures, though their reactions to them were completely different from Nami, Usopp, and Chopper's previous encounters.
After being completely defeated by the Straw Hats, the zombies inadvertently revealed to them about their attack on the latter's friends. For this, the zombies were shoved head first back into their graves.
Later, after the zombies pulled themselves out of the ground, they received orders from Absalom to prepare to attack the Straw Hats.
Absalom reassured the zombies they actually need not fear being burnt, fatigued, or pained, as it is all in their minds as they are dead. The zombies, with the advent of the attack about to begin, were joined by the majority of the other Soldier Zombies in the island and gathered in the area in front of the Mast Mansion. There they started dancing the disco complete with a disco ball.
As the attack commenced, it was later revealed that a massive number of these zombies were purified by
Brook
. Their lifeless corpses were littered across the island and were reported to Moria.
This number of purified creatures, along with other Surprise and Wild Zombies, was later further increased by the Straw Hats' assault to take back their shadows.
The remaining Soldier Zombies stayed far away from the Mast Mansion and watched the gigantic battle between the Straw Hats and
Oars
. Upon seeing Oars being beaten up by Luffy and hearing that their master, Moria, had entered the battle, they were shocked in disbelief of what was happening. After Oars was pulverized, they were ecstatic to see that their master survived. However, their joy, as well as their existence, was put to an end as they watched in horror as Moria took away the shadows animating them to power himself up.
The Soldier Zombies, as well as the other zombies, then returned to being lifeless corpses.
Surprise Zombies
[
]
The Bear's Skin Rug and Painting Zombies.
Surprise Zombies
(
びっくりゾンビ
,
Bikkuri Zonbi
?
)
are disguised as various objects scattered around Thriller Bark. The majority of them seem to be stitched up pieces of skin and cloth sewn together and attached to picture frames. These zombies hide within their picture frames in order to disguise themselves as portraits and when they attack enemies, they come out of their picture frames fully with only a part of them still attached to the picture frames. These zombies appear to be based on the commonly used concept in horror stories of portraits that look as if their eyes are capable of looking around and moving.
Other Surprise Zombies include various zombies disguised as things other than paintings. These include pieces of taxidermy, such as the mounted head of a pig to even an entire wall with a human's face stretched across it.
Several of these Surprise Zombies were seen in the dining hall and hallways of Dr. Hogback's mansion disguised as paintings.
The numbers 204, 217, and 280 were seen printed on three of these zombies. The painting zombies in the dining hall as well the bear skin rug were later defeated by Luffy and the Straw Hats.
General Zombies
[

The General Zombies.
The
General Zombies
(
将軍
ゾンビ
,
Jeneraru Zonbi
?
)
are a specialized group of zombies commanded by Absalom. They first appeared rising up from their resting places when Absalom beckoned them to commence the attack on the Straw Hats.
They are a completely different level of zombies compared to the generic ones. According to Buhichuck, they are built from the corpses of renowned and strong warriors such as legendary samurai and knight leaders.
Among their ranks, they include a drunk zombie named John, a four-armed zombie, a large centaur like zombie with elephant feet, a samurai zombie with a toothbrush mustache called Jigoro, and several other zombies wearing suits of armor. They have been seen with numbers ranging throughout the 800's place.
Special Ranked Zombies
[
]
A
Special Zombie
(
特別
ゾンビ
,
Supesharu Zonbi
?
)
is a type of zombie that is vastly stronger than a regular one. However, only one of these was made, Oars. The original plan by Moria was to create more of these in the future by stealing shadows from more powerful people, and placing them in more powerful corpses.
Marineford Zombies
[
]
Marine Zombies defeated by Jinbe with sea water.
The Marineford zombies are very different from their Thriller Bark counterparts in that they were Marines or pirates that died during the
war
and were revived by Moria's Kage Kage no Mi powers seemingly on the spot, without any known help from Hogback. These zombies had stitches and bandages on them, which made it unclear who exactly put them back together for Moria. It also remains unknown where Moria obtained the shadows necessary to create a large army of zombies.

Zebra Kangaroo (#36)
[

Boxing Zebra Kangaroo Zombie
The zebra kangaroo is a wild zombie that resembles a kangaroo with zebra skin stripes on its body instead of its regular kangaroo fur. It has a pouch with a zipper on its underside and the number 36 printed on it. It wears a bow tie and is equipped with a pair of orange boxing gloves. It somewhat resembles the typical
boxing kangaroo
image commonly used to personify Australia that is seen in various multimedia.
It first appeared in the group of Wild Zombies that appeared in Perona's Wonder Garden and has been frequently seen among them since.
In the anime, the kangaroo is given more screen time as he engages Usopp in a boxing match. However, rather than punch Usopp, he accidentally punches Zombies #52 and #154. As a result, he gives chase to both Usopp and Nami across some stairs along with several small Wild Zombies. Although, they were able to escape by jumping onto a separate column, Usopp decided to taunt the Zebra Kangaroo. This causes it to be angered and it decides to jump across the columns to reach the two. Ultimately, it is shot down by Usopp mid-air as it was jumping towards them.
Later, it appears to have recovered from its fall and appears in Perona's room when Zoro, Sanji, Franky and Usopp stumble in.
Afterwards, it reappears alongside the other wild zombies attempting to wake up an unconscious Perona.
Lion-Cow (#37)
[
]
Lion-Cow Zombie
A zombie that appears to be a small lion of sorts with what looks like the lower half of a cow. It has the number 37 printed on its belly. It was first seen frolicking with a number of other creatures in the forest singing about their "prey" as Nami, Usopp, and Chopper pass by in Hildon's carriage. Upon noticing that they have been seen, they quickly went into hiding.
In the anime, it later appears alongside the other forest zombies cheering on the graveyard zombies as they sing their "Zombie Night" song.
Afterwards, it was seen amongst the zombies escaping the vicinity of the mansion as Oars began his rampage.
Manticore (#69)
[
]
Manticore Zombie
This zombie is a lion with a man's face stitched to its body that Nami saw.
It resembles a manticore, a type of lion with the face of a man, the tail of a scorpion, and the occasional wings of a dragon. It has the number 69 printed on its hind quarters. Upon seeing this beast, Nami tried to convince Usopp and Chopper of what she saw with an apparently bad drawing (which somewhat looked like
Mohji
). Its mouth was removed and placed on Absalom's face. This beast is different from the
Manticores
of
Impel Down
, though they do look somewhat similar.
Comparisons between this manticore's lion faced stitches and Absalom's were often noted. Oda later confirmed that the Manticore's face was indeed used on Absalom's face by Hogback. However, the Manticore's human face was never Absalom's. Absalom's human face may be on another zombie elsewhere. While answering this question, Oda also noted that Absalom has very few Japanese fans and was reluctant to say more on the matter.
Giant Earthworm (#159)
[

Giant Earthworm Zombie
This is a zombie that appears to be a giant earthworm. It has what appears to be a human head stitched on to one end as its face. It has the number 159 on its body. It was first seen frolicking with a number of other creatures in the forest singing about their "prey" as Nami, Usopp, and Chopper pass by in Hildon's carriage. Upon noticing that they have been seen, they quickly went into hiding.
In the anime, it later appears alongside the other forest zombies cheering on the graveyard zombies as they sing their "Zombie Night" song.
Cheshire Cat (#193)
[
]
Cheshire Cat Zombie
This zombie is a stitched up cat wearing what appears to be a pilot's cap. It has the number 193 on its hind quarters. It was first seen frolicking with a number of other creatures in the forest singing about their "prey" as Nami, Usopp, and Chopper pass by in Hildon's carriage. Upon noticing that they have been seen, they quickly went into hiding.
It was later seen roaming a hallway in
Hogback's mansion
as Usopp and Chopper were guarding Nami while she was taking a bath.
In the anime, it later appears alongside the other forest zombies cheering on the graveyard zombies as they sing their "Zombie Night" song.
When Oars was defeated, the cat zombie was among the forest and graveyard zombies expressing their concern. However, as soon as Moria stood back up, he and the other zombies cheered.
Its disturbingly wide grin apparently makes it look like the
Cheshire Cat
from
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
.
