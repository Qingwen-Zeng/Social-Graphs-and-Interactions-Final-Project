Appearance
[

Tilestone is a very large man. He has brown hair tied in a ponytail on the back, and a light-brown beard. He has a tattoo going from his chest near his shoulder to his arm with the kanji for "shipwright"
(

During the attack on Enies Lobby, he had a cartridge belt over the right leg and carried a big firearm held up by another belt on his back.
Personality
[
]
Tilestone yells everything he says, even if the situation calls for speaking quietly. While his fellow co-workers try to accommodate this particular trait of his, Tilestone himself however seems somewhat unaware of his constant yelling.
Relationships
[
]
Galley-La Company
[
]
Because of Tilestone's inability to speak normally, he can be a bother to his fellow co-workers. They do understand his inability and even though they yell at him constantly to be quieter especially in situations that require it, they also seem to try to accommodate it. However, sometimes his constant shouting can really get on their nerves.
Iceburg
[
]
Like most of the Galley-La company and the rest of Water 7, Tilestone has a great respect and deep loyalty for
Iceburg
. He would do anything to protect the hero that saved his home from destitution.

History
[
]
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
Tilestone first appeared when
Mikazuki
's crew refused to pay for the repairs to their ship, which the Galley-La workers responded to by beating the entire crew senseless. Later, after the assassination attempt on
Iceburg
, Tilestone was seen chasing away some reporters who wanted to know who the culprits were.
After Iceburg revealed the identities of the assassins, Tilestone told the foremen,
Kalifa
, and Iceburg that
Franky
and
Luffy
were fighting in the Number One Dock. The foremen then fought against Luffy and (to a lesser extent) Franky. Tilestone knocked Franky away from the site of the battle so the foremen could fight against Luffy, thinking that he had a part in the assassination attempt (as
Nico Robin
, one of the assassins, was part of
Luffy's crew
). However, due to the intervention of Franky, Luffy escaped.
That night, all five foremen sat outside Iceburg's room in order to protect him from any further assassination attempts. After
Paulie
was told by Kalifa that Iceburg wanted to see him, Tilestone foolishly believed that Iceburg wanted to say his last words (which rewarded him with punches and kicks from the rest of the Galley-La foremen). Later, as
CP9
started the attack on Iceburg's mansion, Tilestone and
Peepley Lulu
both stormed away to face the intruders, leaving
Kaku
and Lucci by themselves.
However, later on, several shipwrights told Tilestone that an
assassin
was sitting right outside of Iceburg's room, with the fallen bodies of "Lucci" and "Kaku" next to him. Angered at the sight of his fallen co-workers and fearing for Iceburg's safety, Tilestone attacked the assassin with a giant hammer, but the assassin hardened his own skin to the point that the hammer was crushed on impact. Wondering how the assassin could be stronger than him, Tilestone was hit with an immensely powerful punch from the assassin, knocking him out in one blow.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Later on, Tilestone and Lulu accompanied Paulie, the
Franky Family
, and the Straw Hats to
Enies Lobby
, where CP9 took Franky and Nico Robin. There, the two remaining foremen learned that the true assassins were, in fact, their own allies Kaku, Lucci, Kalifa, and Blueno. This fact shocked them as Tilestone and Lulu originally believed the assassins to be
Michael and Hoichael
from the Water 7 Backstreets.
Tilestone, Kiwi, and the Franky Family defeat the Just Eleven Jurymen.
At Enies Lobby, Tilestone proved to be a valuable fighter, managing to bearhug several Marines into submission at once. He helped with defeating
Oimo
and
Kashii
, and helped Paulie and Lulu hold off the canine units of Enies Lobby's forces until the Straw Hat's arrived with the newly-converted giants.
Tilestone later invaded the courthouse alongside the others. They encountered the
Just Eleven Jurymen
and fought them so that they could lower the drawbridge. Although they were able to defeat them and lower the bridge, they were eventually captured by reinforcements. However, before anything could be done with them, the news of the Buster Call arrived and the Marines and government officials ran, leaving Tilestone and their other captives behind. Tilestone was eventually freed by Paulie who pretended to have been tied up by his own rope.
Seeing as how the island was about to be destroyed, they all ran towards the island's front gate. At the gate, they encountered Vice Admiral
Strawberry
and his battleships and were blasted backwards over the cliff of Enies Lobby. They were, however, saved by Paulie's rope and remained silent, pretending to be dead as to avoid the Marines attacking. With the news of the Straw Hats' survival and victory, they came out of hiding, and Tilestone and the others escaped the island on the Puffing Tom.
Post Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
During the Straw Hats party, Tilestone joined in alongside everyone else that participated in the Enies Lobby fight.
Afterwards, Tilestone, along with the remaining foremen and Iceburg, all helped Franky build
a new ship
for the Straw Hat Pirates.
