?
, VIZ Media: Yama)
by
Kouzuki Oden
and his retainers,
is a giant
boar
that lived in the forests of
Wano Country
as late as thirty years ago. In what became known as the
Mountain God Incident
, it was cut down by
Kouzuki Oden
during its attack on
Flower Capital
,
but it ultimately survived the ordeal.
It later became a retainer of the
Kouzuki Family
alongside its child,
Koyama
.
Appearance
[
]
The Mountain God is an enormous white boar the size of an entire mountain. It has two large tusks and a bunch of sharp teeth that stick out from its lower lip.
After the attack from Oden, it received scar lines from the lip to the back on both sides.
Personality
[
]
The Mountain God is protective of its child and becomes vengefully destructive if it is taken.
Relationships

Child
[
]
The Mountain God is extremely protective of its child, called
Koyama
by
Kouzuki Oden
and his retainers.
If its child is taken, the Mountain God will relentlessly track it down, going so far as to rampage throughout a city to find it.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Due to its immense size and power, the Mountain God could easily wipe out a quarter of the Flower Capital before it was stopped by Oden. It also had an acute sense of smell, which it used to track down its child.
The Mountain God seems to have tremendous endurance, being able to survive being bisected by Oden after being stitched back together.
, although that has more to do with the fact that Oden didn't want to kill it and his cut was so clean and precise that he made sure that the Mountain God wouldn't die.
It is considered a divine creature in the legends of Wano Country.
History

Past
[
]
Forty-one years ago, the Mountain God went on a rampage after its child was captured by a trio of men and taken to the
Flower Capital
by
Kin'emon
. It devoured a village's worth of people, including
Tsurujo
, before attacking the capital. Kin'emon tried in vain to attack the beast after hearing that it ate Tsuru. It then charged at
Kouzuki Oden
after seeing its child with him. Oden cut the creature horizontally with his swords, freeing the people from its stomach.
The Mountain God had its huge gash stitched back together, and several years later when Oden was about to visit the capital, it was told to wait while its child was asked to get into a crate.
