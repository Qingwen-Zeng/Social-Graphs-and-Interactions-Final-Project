Pandawomanmi
is the female version of
Pandaman
. She first appeared in the
Amazon Lily Arc
where Pandaman would not be allowed (as men are forbidden on
Amazon Lily
).
Appearance
[
]
She has
Sailor Moon
-style "dumpling" hair. She appears on Volume 52's cover under the dust jacket beating up
Tomato Gang
and another person. In order to keep her appearances less obvious, like Pandaman, her features are often vague. She wears a black bikini style top and her body appears more human than Pandaman's, giving her the resemblance of a young woman.
Relationships
[
]
Pandaman
is said to be in love with her, but it is unknown if the relationship is mutual.
