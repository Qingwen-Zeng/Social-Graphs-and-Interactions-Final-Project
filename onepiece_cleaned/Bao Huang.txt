History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
During the Beasts Pirates' party on the day of the
Fire Festival
, Bao Huang came to
Kaidou
through an opening in the ceiling after he summoned her to tell him the day's schedule, and she did so.
Before Kaidou went to the Live Stage to make an
announcement
, he asked where
Charlotte Linlin
was and Bao Huang informed him that she was on her way.
During the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's all-out attack on Kaidou's castle, Bao Huang spotted
Shinobu
and
Kouzuki Momonosuke
through a cat that wore a mask similar to hers, and relayed their location to
King
.
She later located the wounded Scabbards, who were in the treasure room on the second floor, and relayed this information to King. When
Black Maria
volunteered to go kill them, Bao Huang warned her that she saw another person with the samurai.
After Momonosuke was discovered, Bao Huang kept track of his group's position,
but the Marys lost track of the group.
They eventually discovered Momonosuke's location in the first floor's crawlspace, and Bao Huang reported the information to Kaidou. He then had her broadcast the announcement of Luffy's defeat to all of Onigashima.
While the Marys were still in Diffusion Mode, Momonosuke made his own announcement, encouraging his forces to keep fighting, as well as relaying Luffy's intent to return and win.
She later learned Momonosuke had fallen off Onigashima, assuming that he had died, and became excited by the thought of breaking the alliance's spirits. But just as she was about to announce this, the battle between
Usopp
and
Nami
versus
Ulti
broke out in front of her, with the Tobiroppo ultimately losing. Bao Huang was so shocked by the result, she unintentionally blurted out the defeat of both Ulti and
Page One
. She is then captured by
Usopp
's Midori Boshi.
Tama
then used the Mary to activate her
power
throughout the castle.
