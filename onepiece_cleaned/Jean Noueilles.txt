Personality
[
]
As a member of the New Fish-Man Pirates, he hates
humans
. His voice also becomes much deeper when he swells up to reveal his needles.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a fish-man, he was born with the natural strength ten times that of an average human, and twice that underwater. The spikes on his body make it difficult for him to be harmed by unarmored melee attacks. He can inflate his body like a pufferfish, extending his spikes outwards in an attempt to stab the enemy. His powers and leadership skills apparently were enough for him to be the commander of the squadron.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The fish-man that replaces Noueilles in the anime.
During Hody's attack on
Ryugu Palace
in the anime, Noueilles was replaced with a
fish-man
with brown hair, rather than black hair. The only resemblances between this fish-man and Noueilles are their jawline and skin tone. In terms of actual resemblance to the manga version of him, he bears little similarity.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Noueilles' alias, "Captain Porcupinefish", was treated as his name by all official English sources, where it was romanized as "Harisenbon". This includes the
seventh popularity poll
, where Noueilles was listed as "Captain Porcupinefish" in Japanese and "Harisenbon" in English.
The anime makes his name more explicit, with both
Daruma
and the credits referring to him as simply "Harisenbon" (without the "Captain" title).
