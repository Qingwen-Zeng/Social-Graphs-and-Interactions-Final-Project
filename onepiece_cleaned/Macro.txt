History
[
]
One day Macro along with other automata and Dr. Tsukimi were watching the moon and eating snacks
when suddenly a huge explosion happened on the moon.
The explosion was of unknown origin. In his shock, Tsukimi swallowed his dumpling without chewing and suffocated to death.
After burying the professor, the four automata traveled to the moon (each one with a balloon)
to take revenge on the one who caused the explosion that resulted in the accidental death of their creator.
Upon reaching the moon, they found the
Space Pirates
and despite overwhelming odds, they fought the captain of the Space Pirates. In the end, however, the four automata were defeated.
When
Spacey
tried to thank
Enel
for defeating the Space Pirates, Enel struck the automata with lightning.
After Enel recharged the lunar city, the automata thanked him for reviving them.
They then joined his army.
