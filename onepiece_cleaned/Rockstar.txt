Rockstar
is a member of the
Red Hair Pirates
, being relatively new in the crew two years ago.
Appearance
[
]
Rockstar is a fairly tall and burly man with dark skin and a red liberty-spikes-like hairstyle. He wears a colorful attire composed of a dark-purple, double-breasted coat (with buttons similar to
Magellan
's), left open on his chest to reveal a light-orange, wide-collared shirt, and a red foulard around his neck. He has a yellow sash tied around his waist, that instead of hanging only on one side, like seen on most of the other pirates, hangs down on both sides. He wears light-blue pants and brown boots and carries around a green-hilted saber, hanging on his left hip from a belt he has over the right shoulder.
Personality
[
]
A confident man, Rockstar demonstrates a great sense of pride. When he was insulted by Whitebeard's men, he wanted to fight them because they had damaged his honor. He also tried to use the strength of his captain to back up the importance of the letter he delivered to
Whitebeard
. He seems very loyal to his captain, sticking up for him in front of Whitebeard.
Rockstar has a strong sense of justice and wants others to always follow rules.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Rockstar is currently considered a heavy hitter of the Red Hair Pirates, a crew led by one of the
Four Emperors
, which attests to his strength. However, he does not hold the rank of
officer
.
Before the timeskip, he was still a newcomer in the crew but held a
94,000,000
bounty
from his previous pirating career.
Rockstar is a
swordsman
and specializes in a style called
Splitting Sword
(
カチ割剣

Kachiwari Ken
