three years prior to

enacting his plan.
Appearance
[

Nugire Yainu's outfit before he was hypnotized in the anime.
Yainu has a square-shaped face with small, round glasses with his black hair combed back neatly. He wears a red shirt with his crew's
jolly roger
on the front, with regular pants and shoes.
He was given the captain's jacket to wear, which was black with red interior and the crew's symbol on the shoulder pads when he was handed over to the
Marines
. Overall, Yainu has a passing resemblance to his
captain
,
Kuro
, to the point where the Marines were not able to tell the difference.

He was shown to be feeble-minded enough to fall victim to
Jango
’s hypnotism.

History

Biography
[
]
Five years ago, when
Kuro
had decided to give up on his life as a
pirate
due to the constant assaults by the
Marines
,
Jango
saw Yainu to be a perfect sacrificial lamb for Kuro's plan. Because Yainu bore a passing resemblance to his
captain
, he was hypnotized by Jango into believing he was Kuro, and was captured by
Morgan
, the only member of a Marine crew to survive Kuro's wrath.
Legacy
[
]
Afterwards, Yainu was presumably taken into Marine custody and executed, leaving Kuro free to assume a new identity (and, inadvertently, enhancing Morgan's reputation and career).
When Kuro was defeated by
Monkey D. Luffy
and tossed off the
Gecko Islands
, his existence was eventually rediscovered by the
Marines
, and reactivating his
bounty
, thus rendering Yainu's sacrifice to be in vain.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Yainu being executed in Kuro's place.
The anime openly depicts Nugire being executed by a firing squad (in a manner identical to
Morgan
's planned execution of
Zoro
and
Koby
), confirming that Kuro's ruse was completely successful.
In the anime, Nugire is also shown wielding a
saber
during the
Black Cat Pirates
' attack on
Morgan
's unit, suggesting he has at least some level of combat ability.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
His name is an
anagram
of the Japanese for "No false charges"
(
濡れ衣いや
,
Nureginu iya
?
, lit. "No wet clothes")
—a grim joke referencing his fate.
VIZ Media
's official
One Piece
translator Stephen Paul informally translated this as "Snott Mee"
, which was later adopted by Shueisha's official website for the 7th
popularity poll
.
The
4Kids-dubbed anime
, though still acknowledging his execution, softens the violence by recoloring the
Marines
'
rifles
to seem more toy-like and removing the scene where they actually fire; his execution post is also (much like
Zoro
's) edited to appear less cross-like.
