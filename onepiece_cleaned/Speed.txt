Despite this, she seems cheerful when she is praised and will smile like a horse in a humorous fashion when complimented or treated well. She seems to like explaining her powers to other people, as seen when she boasted about her great range of vision.

Relationships
[
]
Beasts Pirates
[
]
As a
Shinuchi
, she was put in charge of low-ranking members of the
Beasts Pirates
who caused nothing but test her patience when it came to doing their jobs competently. She became enraged at them when they were goofing off instead of putting out a burning building, causing her to lose her temper. Her subordinates seem to hold her in high regard, often showering her with compliments.
After being tamed by Tama, Speed became an enemy to the Beasts Pirates, as Kaidou nearly killed her for her perceived defection,
and Speed later assisted Tama in spreading the Kibi Dango to other Gifters, further weakening the crew.
Tama
[

Speed showing affection towards Tama.
Upon
Kurozumi Tama
using her
Devil Fruit
abilities
, she was able to fully tame Speed, who went from very stern to carefree and happy once Tama becomes her new master. Speed became very protective over Tama, letting her sit on her back and letting her ride her.
She even went so far as to defy
Kaidou
in order to protect Tama, putting her life in jeopardy to save her.
Speed also assisted Tama aiding the raid on Onigashima, becoming quite concerned for her well-being when she was becoming greatly exhausted and weak from using her abilities too much. Despite her oath to keep Tama safe, she wished to help make her dream come true which would mean putting herself in harm's way for her sake.
Knowing that her dango's effect would wear off after a month, Tama wished for Speed to stay with her forever as a mother, which shocked and moved Speed.
Monkey D. Luffy
[

Luffy rides Speed like a horse.
Speed first encountered Luffy when he was rampaging in Bakura Town, earning her wrath. She was further enraged and shocked at Luffy attempting to ride her like a regular horse. She did not tolerate Luffy touching her until she was tamed by Tama, who changed her demeanor. After this, she grew to tolerate Luffy riding on her back. After Luffy found her injured in Okobore Town, Luffy made sure she was out of harm's way before fighting Kaidou.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Speed was born 24 years ago in
Wano Country
. At some point during her life, she joined the
Beast Pirates
and ate a
SMILE
which gave her horse-like powers. She was later promoted to
Shinuchi
and assigned to
Kuri
, which was udner
Jack
's jurisdiction.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Speed went into the
Paradise Farm
to collect provisions for her and
her crewmates
stationed in Bakura Town. She heard the fire bell ringing and ensured that the fire was put out as she arrived at the recently destroyed remains of
Holed'em
's house. She then brought the Treasure Ship of Provisions to Holed'em as she asked him what was going on and watched as her fellow
Shinuchi
and some of her subordinates were suddenly taken out by
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Roronoa Zoro
.
Speed is tamed by Tama and Luffy.
Speed was shocked at Holed'em's defeat when Luffy, thinking she was a horse, tried to ride on her back. Speed got angry, but when
Kurozumi Tama
offered some
kibi dango
made from her body, she ate it and became subservient to Tama, carrying her and Luffy out of Bakura Town as they made their way to Okobore Town.
After Tama ate some food from the Treasure Ship of Provisions, Speed escorted her back to her home.
On the way, both Speed and Tama were attacked by
Kaidou
when the
Emperor
discovered them. Speed was unable to protect Tama and she was greatly injured. She then traveled back to Okobore Town and collapsed. When Luffy found her, Speed told him what happened. He then put her out of harm's way as he fought Kaidou.
When Tama was left behind, she expressed her wish to support the alliance, so Speed complied taking Tama on her own vessel. While inbound to
Onigashima
, Speed expressed her worry when Tama started to exhaust herself from making too many Kibi Dangos. However, Tama waved aside her worry by expressing how she wished to live in a
Wano
without Kaidou and
Kurozumi Orochi
. Speed then resolved herself to fulfill her master's wish, alongside
Daifugo
and
Gazelleman
, who were also converted into Tama's ally by the dangos. After arriving, the three distributed Tama's dangos to the other Gifters, with Speed claiming it to be a medicine to restore the injured SMILE users created by
Queen
.
Speed acting as a steed on the battlefield.
Speed later heard Tama broadcast her voice across Onigashima through
Bao Huang
.
After Tama issued the command for the newly-turned Gifters to fight against Kaidou, Speed was relieved that the plan had succeeded.
She then came to the aid of Tama,
Nami
, and
Usopp
, who had become a target for the other Beasts Pirates, and let them ride on her back, carrying them through the battlefield.
Speed took refuge with Tama and Nami, while Usopp warded off the Beasts Pirates. Speed noted that
Big Mom's
Supreme King Haki
shockwave was emanating through the floor they were on and knocking out the Beasts Pirates in front of him.
Speed, Tama, and the
Straw Hat Pirates
retrieved
Komachiyo
and descended back to the main floor to escape the fires that were raging out of control. When they came across the sentient legs of
Kinemon
, Speed was left speechless at the legs' ability to talk and communicate.
After splitting up with Usopp and
Hamlet
who went to help Kin'emon and
Kikunojo
, Speed and the others took Komachiyo to the
Beasts' Bath
, where
Marco
treated him and
Hihimaru
. As the ceiling started falling apart into chunks, Speed bid Tama to take shelter with her.
Later, she stepped outside onto the Live Floor with Tama when
Kaidou
appeared inside the Skull Dome to announce Luffy's defeat.
After Kaidou was defeated and Onigashima landed safely, Tama explained that her dangos' effects on the Beasts Pirates would wear off after a month and that some might choose to stay with her. Happier to be with Tama, Speed hugged the girl. Tama then wished that Speed would stay with her forever as a mother, which shocked the Shinuchi. Later, during
Kouzuki Momonosuke
's speech, Speed watched as Tama clung to Nami and cried.
A week later, Speed joined Tama and the other women in the Rock Bath of the shogun's castle.
That evening, she and Tama enjoyed the
Flower Capital
's festival and joined everyone in the toast.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The anime gave Speed more scenes than in the manga. At Bakura Town, she puts up a fierce fight, firing volleys of Haki-infused arrows at Zoro and
Kiku
, who are able to push through her arrow shots and escape.
Also in the anime, Speed is shown putting up a desperate stand against her former leader Kaidou, who greatly injures her and Tama with a fire blast.
During the raid on Onigashima, the anime extends the scene where Speed convinces the Gifters to eat the Kibi Dango, with Speed pretending gain a power boost by eating one herself. The flashback of Speed taking Tama to Onigashima is also extended, giving more dialogue to Speed and showing how they managed to set sail.
