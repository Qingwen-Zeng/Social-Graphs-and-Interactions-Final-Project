Mounblutain
was a member of the
Fake Straw Hat Crew
who masqueraded as
Sogeking
.
Appearance
[
]
Mounblutain wearing his Sogeking mask in the anime.
Mounblutain is a very large man, much taller and rounder than the real Sogeking. He wears a mask which resembles that of the real Sogeking but larger and more exaggerated, and does not completely cover his face, as the real one should. The long nose is also part of the mask and the horns are straighter and rounder than the original mask (which was wavy and flat).
He wears striped pants and a dark red cape, similar to Sogeking's, and a plain shirt. He also wears brown boots and a yellow sash for a belt. He has large, curly hair similar to Sogeking's, as well as a thick beard. Underneath the mask reveals his real face to be wide, with thick lips, a relatively flat nose, and round teeth.
Personality
[
]
Mounblutain is almost always laughing or smiling. Like the other members of the Fake Straw Hats, he uses the name of the real Straw Hats to instill fear in those around him. Upon the truth coming out, he was discovered to be very cowardly, begging
Caribou
for mercy. He is surprisingly noble, as he was the only one who attacked Caribou in order to save
Drip
(Fake Sanji), even with the knowledge that he was a
Super Rookie
with a
210,000,000 bounty on his head.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Mounblutain seems to have at least some endurance, as he was able to stand up after being attacked by carnivorous plants and a massive lighting bolt, although visibly wounded. He also has some strength as was strong enough to pick up
Chocolat
after passing out in the bar and could lift a large bazooka without much strain. He has a weak will as he easily fainted from
Luffy
's
Haki
.
Typical for a fraud, he is very weak as he was easily brought to his knees by the
Caribou Pirates
.
Weapons
[
]
He has been seen using a flintlock pistol, and later a bazooka. Unlike Sogeking, he does not appear to have much skill as a marksman, as he missed the targets he was aiming for at close range (though the closing door blocked his shot)
History
[

Return to Sabaody Arc
[
]
Posing as the
Straw Hat Pirates
,
Demaro Black
(
Monkey D. Luffy
), Mounblutain (
Sogeking
),
Turco
(
Franky
), and
Chocolat
(
Nami
) were trying to recruit new members in a bar on
Sabaody Archipelago
. When the real Nami spurned his captain's invitation to the crew, Mounblutain commented that the man Nami was waiting for would cry and apologize once he saw (fake) Luffy. As the
crew
advanced on Nami, they were caught the real Usopp's
Midori Boshi: Devil
and then struck by lightning from
Nami's thunder clouds
. The crew survived and went around the archipelago, searching for Nami and Usopp and attacking anyone that closely resembled them. While doing so, they ran into the real Luffy.
When Black attempted to shoot Luffy for bumping into him, Luffy used
Supreme King Haki
to knock the fake pirates unconscious.
Upon waking up, the crew was met by
Manjaro
(
Roronoa Zoro
) and
Drip
(Sanji) with the real
Tony Tony Chopper
. After hearing about the capture of
Cocoa
(
Nico Robin
), Black ordered the crew to gather their allies to Grove 46.
At Grove 46, Mounblutain stood alongside Black as the captain gave a speech to their new recruits and ordered them to find the people who had insulted him. Manjaro and Drip brought Luffy to the meeting,
but before Black could punish Luffy, the
Marines
surrounded the pirates. As fighting broke out,
Sentomaru
and two
Pacifistas
arrived so the fake Straw Hats attempted to flee. Sentomaru knocked out Black and revealed him to be a fake, which angered Black's allies. The rest of the fake crew fled, but stopped in shock when the real Luffy was revealed.
Mounblutain and the remaining Fake Straw Hats beg for their lives.
Mounblutain and the other fake Straw Hats (sans Black, Cocoa, and
Nora Gitsune
) managed to escape the battle but were captured by
Caribou
and
Coribou
. The fakes begged for their lives as Coribou prepared to bury them alive. When Caribou started to suffocate Drip with
his Devil Fruit powers
, Mounblutain fired a bazooka at Caribou, who was unaffected due to his
Logia
intangibility, and Caribou's men beat Mounblutain into submission.
As Caribou and his crew later disembarked to hunt down the real Straw Hats, Mounblutain's status is unknown.
