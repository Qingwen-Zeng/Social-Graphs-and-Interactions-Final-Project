Poppoko
is a member of the
Alvida Pirates
and the triplet brother of
Heppoko
and
Peppoko
.
Appearance
[
]
Poppoko is an overweight man, with a large chin, black hair, and a bit of stubble on his chin. He wears a black and white striped bandana, with a matching short sleeved shirt. His sideburns also come down into a curl.
Personality
[
]
Typical of his thuggish appearance, Poppoko likes to intimidate
Koby
due to his low status and timid personality. He fears
Alvida
, and tried to deny slacking off (which she hates) when she found him doing so. He, like the rest of the crew, calls her beautiful simply to avoid her Iron Mace.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
He does not seem to be very strong as Luffy unintentionally knocked him out when he emerged from the barrel.
History
[
]
Poppoko was present when
Alvida
learnt of a new
Warlord
being installed.
Romance Dawn Arc
[
]
Luffy emerges from the barrel.
Poppoko, along with his crewmates
Heppoko
,
Peppoko
and
Koby
, found
Luffy
in the barrel he had drifted to their hideout in as they were about to have a drink from the barrel thinking it had wine in it. The first three intimidated Koby due to his low status as a ship caretaker, and tried to attack Luffy, but were interrupted by Alvida's attack. After that, they reported to Alvida about Luffy when she scolded them, thinking they were slacking off. They later accompanied her to the site where Luffy and Koby were. They were shocked when Luffy insulted Alvida. They were even more shocked to witness Luffy surviving Alvida's blow and defeating her. Luffy then orders them to give him and Koby a boat to which they complied.

Manga and Anime Differences
[
]
Poppoko never appeared alongside Heppoko in the same scene in the anime as opposed to the manga. Instead, a miscellaneous crew member replaced Heppoko in the scene when Luffy's barrel was opened. Poppoko is accidentally knocked out by Luffy when he breaks out of the barrel and is later sent flying by Alvida, and so he never appears alongside Heppoko in any scene.
Another difference is that when Alvida is sent flying by Luffy, she ends up crashing down on top of him in the water.
In the anime, Poppoko later reappears in the
Loguetown Arc
as a member of
Gally
's crew.
Alvida Pirates' extra member in the anime, to the right.
