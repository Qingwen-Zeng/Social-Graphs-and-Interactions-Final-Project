In his youth, he only had one ponytail.
Personality
[
]
He appeared to have full confidence in the abilities of his unit, warning the
Arlong Pirates
that the
77th Branch
is known for its valor. Unfortunately for him and his men, however, the commodore underestimated the pirate's abilities, possibly out of overconfidence in the Marines. He was shown to practice a somewhat refined version of justice, caring for not only the evacuation of the survivors from
Arlong
's reign, but also destroying the Arlong pirates altogether for their crimes. Unlike
Nezumi
, he appeared not in the least bit willing to negotiate with Arlong.
Relationships

Subordinates
[
]
He seemed to care for his subordinates. He had a casual conversation about
Arlong Park
with one of his subordinates. Before emerging into battle with the
Arlong Pirates
, Pudding Pudding encouraged his men to fight. His subordinates cared about him, as they were very angry at
Chew
when the fish-man attacked their commodore.
Pirates
[
]
He believed that pirates should not be able to set up a base. Because of his strong sense of justice, he could not overlook
pirates
that he encountered, despite the mission he is on. Despite this, when he directly encounters a pirate, he would introduce himself and he ask them to surrender first.
Arlong
[
]
When Pudding Pudding's ship attacked

History

East Blue Saga
[
]
Arlong Park Arc
[
]
He was dispatched to
Arlong Park
to evacuate the survivors of Arlong's tyrannical reign and arrest him and his men. When Pudding Pudding saw the
Fish-Man
's base, hubris got the better of the commodore, and he ordered an attack. This provoked Arlong's ire, and he sent his fishmen who attacked the ship. Pudding Pudding stopped his men from attacking. When Chew came on board the ship Pudding Pudding tried to introduce himself, but was shot by Chew. He later asked the Fishman what they want, however he along with the rest of his sank at the bottom of the ocean.
Manga Influences
[
]
It was asked by a fan if Pudding Pudding was modeled after Purin Purin-chan from the 1981 puppet show, "
Tales of Purin Purin
". Oda confirmed the similarity between the two characters (his older sister liked the show), however, he only remembered the name and hairstyle.
