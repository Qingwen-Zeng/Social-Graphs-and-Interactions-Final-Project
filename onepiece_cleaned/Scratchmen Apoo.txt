Scratchmen Apoo
,
also known as
"Roar of the Sea"
, is the
captain
of the
On Air Pirates
and was formerly an informant for the
Beasts Pirates
, led by
Kaidou
of the
Four Emperors
.
He is a member of the
Longarm Tribe
and one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "
Worst Generation
", being one of the eleven
Supernovas
who came to
Sabaody Archipelago
two years ago with a bounty of
198,000,000.
Two years later, his bounty increased to
350,000,000.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist in the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Being of the
Longarm Tribe
from the Grand Line, one of Apoo's distinguishing traits is his incredibly long arms. Each of these long arms possesses two elbow joints instead of just one, making them much longer than a normal person's. These arms make it possible for him to utilize his
Devil Fruit
powers without the need to contort the said limbs, whenever he converts them into makeshift instruments.
Apoo also has a rather broad chest cavity, which may aid him in producing deep and bellowing drum-like sounds. Apoo's lower jaw is also somewhat wider than the upper half of his face, similar to
Itomimizu
of the
Foxy Pirates
. Besides these, his most distinguishing attributes are his unique physical characteristics and the objects adorned on him, all of which are music themed or related. His teeth have a unique look to them as they resemble piano keys. His fighting stance is also music themed as he appears like he's moving his hands in the same way a DJ would move theirs when mixing music on turntables.
He wears a set of orange headphones with his name on either side over his ears and hairstyle similar to
Jabra
's, where the hair on his scalp has been pulled tightly so that his roots resemble lightning patterns. Before the time skip, the portion of hair at the center of his forehead was, while spiky, flattened into a square shape. After the timeskip, the center portion of his hair resembled a triangle shape while the side strips were more straightened as opposed to appearing like lightning bolts. During the
Fire Festival
, the side strips of hair as well as the center portion all resembled lightning bolts.
Apoo wears a red gown with the symbol 音
(
oto
?
, "sound" or "music")
at the center of a large flower-like print splayed across the chest area, as well as on his back. His clothes are possibly inspired by the
Qizhuan or Manfu
style of chinese garb. Apoo also has a yellow scarf around his waist. He also has what seems to be the design of a green rose sewed on front of his left shoulder.
In
SBS Volume 64
, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Apoo is shown with significantly shorter hair and a rounder face. His hair was also combed into a pompadour in the front, with his braid in the back. His attire was a less elaborate shirt and bow tie. His teeth also lacked the dark markings that make them resemble piano keys.
After the timeskip, he wears a set of black headphones, and changed to a different garb that has the kanji moved to the right side of his pants. He also updated his gown with ornamental ropes, or
huaniu
, across the chest, and epaulets on the shoulders, evoking imagery of
some
high ranking
marine uniforms
.

Personality
[
]
Apoo is an eccentric, boisterous pirate with an affinity for music and parties. A disc jockey by nature, Apoo employs dancing and music playing in many of his mannerisms, acting like a stereotypical radio personality.
One reason he appears to enjoy being part of the
Beasts Pirates
is because of the "Golden Kagura" celebration they hold annually during every
Fire Festival
, making sure that he would not miss the latest.
He also happens to be an enthusiastic photographer and journalist, being excited at the prospect of a news story he could potentially profit massively from.
Apoo seems to be a passive individual who would not seek to harm others without a good reason. As a result, he is normally defensive during confrontations, postponing a brawl with
Eustass Kid
at a
Sabaody Archipelago
bar because they were about to finally head into the
New World
. Despite this, Apoo can be very curious at times, meaning he cannot deny himself an audience to an interesting battle should the opportunity present itself. When facing an opponent that is too strong for him, Apoo prefers to run away, although he enjoys provoking and taunting his enemies before leaving.
Apoo is highly opportunistic, preferring to strike from a safe distance and through the element of surprise. Deceitful and treacherous, Apoo is smarter than he lets on. Despite having a bad relationship with Eustass Kid, Apoo was still able to feign cooperation and convincingly play the part of ally to him, only to later set his supposed allies against one of the
Four Emperors
, for whom Apoo worked all along. Apoo has a low opinion of
Pirate Alliances
in general, believing that they only lead to eventual betrayal.
Shown to be very cunning and backstabbing, Apoo is willing to change sides on a whim with no loyalty to anyone other than himself, letting his targets fight against each other and take themselves out so he can step in at the end and finish off the last man standing.
In spite of his usually outgoing and reckless character, Apoo can be rather cautious and distrustful of other people. At the end of the
Summit War of Marineford
, Apoo could not fathom why a pirate like
Trafalgar Law
would put themselves in potential danger to rescue
someone
, having been aware of the nasty rumors surrounding the "Surgeon of Death". This mindset has not changed much post-timeskip, especially when he finds himself in territory he perceives as hostile. Apoo wreaked havoc on Kid's hideout under the suspicion that a
sniper
could have been targeting him.
He is also perceptive enough to sense killing intent emanating from others.
Apoo is a gutsy pirate who knows the importance of a fight. He never starts a fight only for him to flinch later. When he took photos of CP0's agents willing to sell them to Morgans, which resulted in one of the agents attacking him, he proudly got up from the attack and continued what he started.
Like many other One Piece characters, he has his own
laughter style
: "Apapapa" (アッパッパッパッ)
Relationships
[
]
Eustass Kid
[
]
Kid
once got into a fight with Apoo at
Sabaody Archipelago
, but they both agreed to postpone their fight until after they entered the
New World
. During their meeting in the New World, Apoo wrecked Kid's hideout and beat up one of his crew members because of the possibility that Kid was hiding a sniper, enraging Kid and resulting in a scuffle. However, it is revealed shortly after that they in fact planned to form an
alliance
.
Despite their differences, they came into an agreement.
Apoo is confronted by Kid for betraying him.
Kid and Apoo seemed to have gotten on more amiable terms with each other as themselves and their crews were able to dine together.
However, after the encounter with
Kaidou
, and Apoo's ties with the Beasts Pirates revealed,
he broke off his allegiance with Kid. Kid felt betrayed and declared that the alliance was over.
Upon seeing Apoo again during the raid on Onigashima, Kid wasted no time seeking revenge against him. Apoo, in turn, was shocked to see him and panicked from Kid's attack. When Kid confronted Apoo for setting him and his crew up, Apoo just mocked him for thinking they had a chance of taking down an Emperor, stating that pirate alliances have no happy endings.
Beasts Pirates
[
]
Sometime before meeting Kid and Hawkins, Apoo joined the
Beasts Pirates
as an informant, scouting powerful individuals to conscript into their crew. He then set them up to force them to join Kaidou.
Apoo has great faith in his leader's capabilities, stating to Kid that a mere alliance would not defeat him.
Despite this, Apoo has no real loyalty to Kaidou, willing to finish him off should he stand victorious in the war between the
Beasts Pirates
and the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
.
Queen
[
]
Given their shared music-loving personalities, Apoo is closely affiliated with the
All Star
Queen
, to whom the latter refers to as "brother"
and shown when the two perform together at the same concert hall.
However, Apoo finds Queen's virus-based weapons repulsive. In turn, Queen is not above putting Apoo in a sadistic game with the infected people, giving him the antibodies to the
Ice Oni
virus and threatening to kill him if he lost it to the people chasing after him for it.
When Apoo eventually lost the antibody vial, Queen attempted to kill him for his failure.
Numbers
[
]
Apoo seemingly wields a level of authority over the
Numbers
of Kaidou's crew, having witnessed their destructive prowess firsthand. Apoo was shown returning to Wano along with the Numbers following a voyage, though the nature of this trip is currently unknown.
In addition to this, Apoo has demonstrated command over the Numbers, first shown when he summoned
Hatcha
and again when he threatened to call out more of the giants through his devil fruit abilities. When he was later seen convincing Drake to form an alliance with him, he had three of the Numbers with him, allegedly seeing the giants as his allies and friends, as he was apologizing to Zanki for leaving him behind when fleeing from the CP0 Agents as well as making sure Inbi was close to him when fleeing, showing he cares for their safety and views them as companions rather than crewmates.
X Drake
[
]
Apoo and Drake have a relationship of mutual hatred and cannot stand each other. Drake seemingly has always despised Apoo during his time as a Tobiroppo, while Apoo finds Drake's attempt to join forces with the
Straw Hat Pirates
laughable.
That being said, Apoo was still willing to join forces with Drake to take out whoever won the war at Onigashima, reasoning that neither he nor Drake fit into either side and could the opportunity to benefit themselves. After Drake had rejected his proposal, they became fierce enemies once more, but when both pirates found themselves standing in the way of CP0 agents
Guernika
and
Maha
, they decided to team up to engage the government agents. However, once the agents gained the upper hand, Apoo did take his leave and abandoned the fight, feeling no remorse or regrets towards Drake for leaving him behind.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a member of the
Worst Generation
, Apoo is a fearsome pirate who, with his crew, was able to survive the
Grand Line
's
first half
and ultimately enter the
New World
. Over the timeskip, his bounty rose from
198,000,000 (the sixth highest among the Eleven Supernovas of his generation) to
350,000,000, indicating his great strength.
Despite his eccentric looks and demeanor, Apoo has proven himself quite competent and no-nonsense in battle, especially with his peculiar yet dangerous
Devil Fruit
ability. Using it pre-timeskip on the
Sabaody Archipelago
, he was able to land two effective surprise attacks on (though failed to actually harm)
Marine Admiral
Kizaru
when none of the other Supernovas involved in the battle could even touch him.
Post-timeskip on
Onigashima
, Apoo was able to injure both
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Roronoa Zoro
in succession, leaving the former briefly unconscious from a single attack, by capitalizing on their lack of understanding (and knowing how to guard against) his powers.
In general, Apoo has been seen effectively holding his own against his fellow members of the Worst Generation, such as
X Drake
, even with them knowing how to evade his powers.
As the former informant of the
Beasts Pirates
, Apoo held a certain degree of authority in the organization; in particular, he seems to have the ability to command the
Numbers
, who are known to be extremely difficult to bring under control by other members of the Beasts Pirates.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Though he is shown to have a strong preference for fighting at a medium-to-long distance using his "Fighting Music", Apoo has some competence in close-quarters combat, specifically while wielding his pair of tonfas, and is strong enough to parry attacks from two physically mighty foes at once. He could even trade blows with
X Drake
while the latter was in his
human-allosaurus
hybrid form.
Otherwise, Apoo has displayed impressive agility and acrobatic jumping skills
as well as notable durability. He retained consciousness (though was heavily injured) after being kicked down into a multistoried concrete building with enough force to make it collapse
and recovered quickly from getting crushed by a palm strike from
Kid
's
giant arm of scrap metal
(and, while somewhat injured by the latter, swiftly responded with an attack of his own).
Apoo also took a powerful surprise attack from an
Ittoryu
-using Zoro, which seemed to cut rather deep into his chest, and remained not only conscious but still able to fight.
High Intelligence
[
]
Apoo demonstrates high intelligence as he can use his wits to come out advantageous in any situation. While outwardly proposing an alliance with the Kid Pirates and the Hawkins Pirates, it was actually a ruse to set up the other two in order to absorb them into the Beast Pirates with whom he had pledged his services to already.
In Wano, he was able to survive attacks from members of the other Worst Generation and several other heavy-hitters while not engaging in any large-scale skirmishes himself. When encountering X Drake, a fellow member of the Worst Generation, Apoo proposed to Drake to form an alliance to eliminate whichever side that won the raid afterwards, but he was rejected. He tried the same tactic on Kaidou's son, Yamato, which failed due to the fact that Yamato had joined the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
.
Musical Skills
[
]
Apoo has shown extensive musical prowess to go along with his Devil Fruit ability, allowing him to play the various wildly different instruments he can transform into (see below) with casual ease.
True to his name, he is also a skilled DJ.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Oto Oto no Mi
Apoo using his Devil Fruit power.
Apoo ate the Oto Oto no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to morph parts of his body into various musical instruments that he can play—e.g., his jaw into a cymbal or bulb horn, his chest into a drum, his teeth into piano keys, or his arm into a saxophone—and he refers to this as his
"Tatakau Music"
. By playing specific notes and tunes using specific instruments, Apoo releases sound waves that, apart from seeming to have a hypnotic effect, can instantly deliver various forms of physical damage (e.g., slashing, impact, or explosive) to anyone who hears them, depending on what instrument he plays.
Additionally, Apoo can limit his music's effects to specific targets of his choosing, specifically those he is looking at.
As noted by
Killer
, Apoo's attacks carry anywhere in hearing range and, as long as his music is heard by his chosen target, its effects are nigh-instant and unavoidable;
since the only "traveling" part of Apoo's attacks is the sound itself, they are hard to predict, with the speed of effect enough that extremely fast adversaries are unable to react.
The decisive weakness of Apoo's ability is that if the target's ears are blocked (even if just covered with their hands) before the sound hits, said target becomes immune to his techniques (something notably facilitated by the
ability to see the future
), although such efforts to block out sound tend to inhibit Apoo's opponents from being able to fight properly.
Furthermore, if one is outside the seemingly predetermined range of the sound (i.e., hearing range) in the first place, one will also be safe,
and since Apoo aims his attacks with his sight, one can predict where the attacks will land based on where Apoo looks and thereby dodge.
Due to said weaknesses, Apoo's powers are best-suited for use against first-time opponents or in surprise attacks.

History

Past
[
]
Not much is known about Apoo's past; besides the fact that he became a pirate and started the
On Air Pirates
, and that his crew made their start on the
Grand Line
, navigating the treacherous seas, and becoming infamous enough to earn a bounty of
198,000,000 before reaching the
Sabaody Archipelago
.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
Apoo and Kid conflict on the Sabaody Archipelago.
After a long voyage following one of the
Log Pose
routes of the
Grand Line
, Apoo and his crew came to the
Sabaody Archipelago
to prepare themselves for the
New World
. While there, he had a little squabble with
Eustass Kid
in Grove 24. Knowing full well what would happen if they caused an incident in Sabaody, Apoo asked Kid to postpone their battle until they met in the New World, to which Kid agreed.
As Apoo continued his stay in Sabaody, he and his crew witnessed some of the cruelty imposed on the inhabitants by the
World Nobles
. While witnessing Saint
Charlos
abuse a citizen, Apoo was suddenly shocked when a newly-arrived
Roronoa Zoro
tried to defend the
man
. Fortunately for Apoo and his crew,
Jewelry Bonney
stopped Zoro and faked the swordsman's death in order to prevent an incident from occurring. Though danger was averted, Apoo sensed a strong killing intent from Zoro as he witnessed the scene.
Upon hearing of
Luffy
's attack on a World Noble, he seemed reluctant to leave, asking if only the
Straw Hat Pirates
will be targeted by the coming
Marines
. Also, like
X Drake
, he seemed eager to find out which
admiral
would be dispatched to deal with the Straw Hat crew's actions.
Despite the best efforts of his crew to get him off the island, Apoo insisted on seeing the admiral in action and felt that he should anger
Kizaru
before he runs away.
Later on, a brawl erupted between Kizaru, a
Pacifista
,
Basil Hawkins
, Drake, and
Urouge
, which Apoo excitedly began to watch.
As the battle unfurled, Apoo witnessed the three captains' true powers, including Drake's dinosaur
Zoan
Devil Fruit
ability, which he stated he had never seen before.
Apoo is struck down by Kizaru.
After Kizaru had felled Urouge and blinded Hawkins, he prepared to kill Hawkins, but Apoo intervenes and saved the pirate by emitting sounds played on various body parts, which were being used as instruments as he rapped over the music. His ability not only stunned and mesmerized Kizaru, the other captains, and possibly the Pacifista, but also badly damaged the admiral. Apoo released a sound wave likening to the cutting tone of a cymbal, which traveled down and cleanly sliced Kizaru's right arm off. After this attack, Apoo pounded on his chest, releasing a loud booming drum-like sound which also produced a visible sonic wave. This caused an explosion around Kizaru's midsection
and he collapsed on the ground in two parts.
While Kizaru is incapacitated, Apoo attempted to flee the scene; however, the admiral reanimated himself using his Devil Fruit ability, caught up to the pirate by teleporting with his powers, and then kicked him through a building. Apoo was left on the ground, defeated and badly hurt.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Apoo watched
Ace
's execution televised at Sabaody, meaning that he managed to escape capture by the Marines. It is made apparent at the very least that Apoo's crew sailed away from Sabaody and came back because one of his crew mates was complaining how they came back to see Ace's execution only for the broadcast to be cut off. Apoo correctly assumed that the Marines stopped the broadcast because there was something that the Marines did not want society to see.
Apoo was among the Supernova crews that gathered some distance from
Marineford
to witness the end of the war between the Marines and
Whitebeard
's forces. After the war had ended, Apoo angrily wondered why
Trafalgar Law
would go save Luffy, mentioning that Law had a vicious reputation and that Luffy was a rival.
Post-War Arc
[
]
The On Air Pirates running literally "on air" in the New World.
Weeks later, Apoo and his crew had made it into the New World and stopped at a
spring island
. They are seen running in fear from a stampede of monstrous boars, running toward the end of a cliff. Apoo commanded his crew to jump off the cliff, but much to everyone's surprise, they ran off the cliff and seemingly on thin air while the boars continued to chase after them.
During the Timeskip
[
]
Sometime during the two-year timeskip, Apoo and his crew wandered into
Big Mom
's
territory
and were forced to flee.
He had also joined the
Beasts Pirates
, though he kept his allegiance a secret from the public.
His bounty also gained an increase of
350,000,000 during those two years.
Dressrosa Saga

Punk Hazard Arc
[

Kid, Apoo and Hawkins meeting in the New World.
During the events surrounding
Punk Hazard
, Apoo arrived (on invitation) at Kid's base in the New World. In one of the main rooms, he tore the place apart, claiming to believe there was a sniper hiding, while
Basil Hawkins
sat at a nearby table patiently. Once Kid arrived and objected to his treatment of the base, the two captains quickly began fighting, leaving
Killer
taken aback and trying to calm them down. Hawkins stood to leave, but Killer stopped him. After doing so, Killer then revealed their intention to create an alliance with the
On Air
and
Hawkins
pirates.
A newspaper later revealed that the three captains had come to an agreement and formed an alliance.
The group was confused on how the information got out, but put that topic to the side. They then started plans to take down an
Emperor
.
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
After
Doflamingo
's defeat, Kid, Hawkins, and Apoo were dining together when they heard the news of what happened at
Dressrosa
. They figured that Luffy and Law were after
Kaidou
since Doflamingo was connected to him. They were pleased that Luffy and Law were not after
the same Emperor
.
The allied pirates find themselves facing Kaidou.
Some time later, Apoo and the others were alerted by what seemed to be an earthquake. They quickly investigated the source of the commotion, which was a large human-shaped crater in the ground. A gigantic man emerged from the hole, having jumped and fallen 10,000 meters from
Ballon Terminal
, a
Sky Island
. The alliance then came face-to-face with the Emperor, Kaidou.
At that time, Hawkins, Kid, and Killer discovered that Apoo was already working for Kaidou with the intention of setting them up to join him as his subordinates.

One Piece: Stampede
[
]
The Worst Generation fight together against Douglas Bullet.
Apoo and his crew attended the
Pirates Festival
on
Delta Island
. He participated in the main event, the Treasure Race, safely sailing up the
Knock Up Stream
and landing on the central Treasure Island, where all the pirates raced for
Gol D. Roger
's treasure, all the while battling other Worst Generation members. When
Buggy
ended up exposing himself after snatching the treasure, Apoo and his crew chased after the Warlord. However, the Treasure Race was cut short, when someone threw a galleon at the island, destroying it, and sending everything plummeting back to the surface. When Apoo realized that the one who did this was
Douglas Bullet
, he was quite surprised. In the end, he gave into Bullet's taunting, and together with the other Worst Generation members (except for Zoro and Law) attacked the Demon Heir. At first the Worst Generation pirates managed to deal a few good blows on the veteran, but when the opponent revealed his
Gasha Gasha no Mi
powers, the battle quickly ended in their defeat.
Later, after Bullet was defeated, his crew along with the other Worst Generation pirates and several other crews attempted to break through the
Marines
encirclement surrounding the island. They were able to successfully escape thanks to
Sabo
and
Ann
creating a blazing barrier to protect them.
Concludes non-canon section.
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After sailing outside, Apoo arrived at Wano and contacted Kaidou to inform him of his arrival to attend the
Fire Festival
along with the
Numbers
.
Kid attacks Apoo.
Inside
Onigashima
, Apoo played as the DJ as the Beasts Pirates commenced the celebration.
When Luffy and Zoro began causing a commotion, Apoo leaped into the fray and managed to injure them with his fighting music before Kid flattened the traitorous pirate with a gigantic scrap metal fist.
Apoo recovered quickly and retaliated, forcing Kid back. As Luffy, Zoro, and Kid ran to the castle, Apoo tried to attack them again, but his attack had no effect when they covered their ears.
Apoo picks up Queen's antibody vial.
As the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
waged war in Kaidou's stronghold, Apoo tried to attack Luffy and Sanji, but thanks to Luffy's Observation Haki, they were able to protect themselves in time. Apoo was then distraught over the defeats of Jaki, Goki, and Juki, and he told Hatcha to attack the rebels. As Apoo was running to call in more of the Numbers, Zoro and Drake attacked him, but Apoo dodged their attack.
After
Queen
unleashed the
Ice Oni
virus, Apoo attempted to escape the floor, but was blocked by a locked door. Queen tossed the only antibody vial in existence to Apoo and threatened to kill him if he lost it. For his own twisted amusement, Queen gave everyone the challenge of taking the antibodies from Apoo, causing him to be chased throughout the Live Stage by both the alliance and the Beasts Pirates.
Apoo is cut down by Zoro.
As Apoo fled from his pursuers, he was met by a combined assault from Zoro and Drake.
While Apoo was busy defending himself from Drake's attacks, Zoro struck down Apoo and acquired the antibody vial.
Apoo later recovered and attempted to retrieve the vial, but was stopped by Drake.
He still persistently attempted to retrieve the vial, facing Drake and
Hyougoro
simultaneously.
However, Apoo remained unable to get past them.
He was impressed when Hyougoro resisted the virus and used its strength boost to defeat most of the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
and
Mimawarigumi
.
Apoo later withdrew from the Performance Floor and took shelter in the Cave Chamber, along with three Numbers and Drake. Apoo proposed an alliance to Drake with the goal of taking down whoever the raid's victor is.
Unfortunately for him, Drake did not accept the proposal, forcing Apoo to defend himself from him while fighting back with his Devil Fruit powers. He became annoyed when Drake figured out how his ability worked, but still insisted he had the advantage with the Numbers backing him up. After
Yamato
had barged in, Apoo switched tactics and decided to convince Yamato to join his endeavor in taking out the war's victor (unaware that Yamato was on the side of the alliance), only for Yamato to promptly reject Apoo's offer as he continued on his way with
Fuga
following on his tow. Desperate to not let this opportunity slip away, he gave chase after him with
Inbi
and
Zanki
.
Drake and Apoo team up against CP0.
Apoo eventually reached the second floor of the basement, still intent on having Yamato on his side. He witnessed the
Kazenbo
falling through the floor, burning several Beasts Pirates as well as the agents of
CP0
Guernika
and
Maha
who were pursuing
Nico Robin
and
Brook
. Excited by the presence of CP0 as a potential news story he could sell to
Morgans
, Apoo was struck on the neck by Guernika to be silenced. He survived thanks to employing
Armament Haki
to endure the lethal strike and countered an attack from CP0 meant for Drake (who had been pursuing him). Apoo then reluctantly agreed to team up with the undercover Marine in order to fight the government agents.
As soon as the agents gained the upper hand though, Apoo and Inbi abandoned the fight, leaving Zanki and Drake behind. Apoo apologized to Zanki but felt no remorse towards Drake.
When they were unable to escape from the basement due to the fire, Inbi tried to break through a wall, but the wall was too hot and burned his hand. Apoo scolded him for complaining and urged him to sacrifice his arm so they could survive. Inbi grew irritated, so Apoo asked him if he wanted to fight.
They were saved from the flames by the water with which
Raizo
and
Jinbe
flooded the castle.
Apoo was later shocked to hear
Nekomamushi
's announcement that Luffy had beaten Kaidou.
Despite the country's closed border, Apoo succeeded in leaking information on the events of the raid. A week later, Apoo and Inbi met up with the pirates repairing their ships at
Tokage Port
. Apoo tossed down a newspaper which announced the updated bounties and new Emperors.
The news of Luffy becoming an Emperor of the Sea made Kid storm off, and Apoo questioned where he had gone. The Heart and Kid Pirates followed after Kid to the Flower Capital.
