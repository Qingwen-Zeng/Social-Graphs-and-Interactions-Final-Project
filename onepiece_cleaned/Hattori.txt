Hattori
is
Rob Lucci
's
pet
pigeon, and initially acted as the target of his ventriloquism.
Appearance
[
]
Hattori is a white pigeon and is always seen wearing a light red tie while Lucci was undercover as a shipwright and a black one afterwards.
He wore a light green coat identical to his master's while Lucci wore his during the
Sea Train
ride to
Enies Lobby
and the meeting at the
Tower of Justice
.
After the timeskip, Hattori wears a white coat and hat resembling those worn by Lucci, though with the addition of a white necktie.

Personality
[
]
Why Hattori is with Lucci is unknown considering the man's reputation as a heartless mass-murderer, though Lucci has had him since he was a child. He apparently is not afraid of Lucci and is very loyal to him, as he stays close to his master even in dangerous situations like the
Buster Call
. He even attempted to bandage him after his fight with Luffy and was happy when Lucci finally woke up in the hospital in
St. Poplar
. When Lucci is not fighting, Hattori is usually perched on his master's right shoulder.
Lucci would have had to express some emotions to blend in with citizens while undercover, but Hattori did this for him as his ventriloquist dummy; this allowed Lucci to be somewhat sociable while at the same time remain emotionless.
While Hattori reverts to being an ordinary pigeon after Lucci was revealed to be an assassin, he occasionally exhibits human traits such as drinking from a cup.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Hattori mimics human behaviour.
Hattori does not seem to have any combat abilities, and in battle, tends to fly out of the way, generally hovering around in a circle like a bird of prey until the fight is over. He does, however, seem to be incredibly intelligent, able to understand human mannerisms and can mimic them as part of Rob Lucci's ventriloquism act in Water 7, such as moving his beak in sync with Lucci's words and moving his wings around like human arms, as well as facial expressions.
He was also seen wearing a coat, holding a glass and drinking like a human.
History
[
]
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
During Lucci's time at
Water 7
, Hattori was used as part of a ventriloquism act his master developed; in which Hattori was completely in sync with him, as he was able to move his beak and make gestures with his wings to match everything Lucci says without his master having to do anything.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Hattori was seen during the travel to Enies Lobby, with his coat, waiting until the arrival. He then stood most of the time on Lucci's shoulder, until he left during Lucci's fight with
Monkey D. Luffy
. When Lucci was finally defeated, he returned and landed on his injured back. It was shown that Hattori tried to bandage up Lucci after his battle.
Summit War Saga
[
]
CP9's Independent Report
[
]
Hattori returns to Lucci after his defeat.
After the
Buster Call
, he is seen with the rest of
CP9
as they used the Sea Train tracks to escape the pursuing Marines
Spandam
sent so he could blame the agents for his failed mission. They reached
St. Poplar
where the agents worked as street performers (
Kalifa
as a street cleaner) to pay for Lucci's medical fees. He has apparently been following them around the town as he was seen being fed by
Kumadori
.
He was at the window when Lucci awoke, clearly very happy that his master had finally awaken after the epic battle with Luffy.
After Lucci was discharged from the hospital, Hattori returned to his perch on his master's shoulder.
CP9 decided to go bowling to celebrate Lucci's recovery, but the game was interrupted when the
Candy Pirates
invaded St. Poplar. Lucci dealt excessive justice to the captain, for which they had to leave the town. They used the pirate's ship and returned to their homeland where they watched the future generation of CP9 being trained, until Captain
Very Good
came to capture them. As CP9 fought and defeated the unit, Lucci contacted a crippled Spandam to say that they would be coming for him. They then used Very Good's ship to go after their former director.
During the Timeskip
[
]
Sometime during the timeskip, Lucci, Hattori and the other former members of CP9 began training to become stronger. They eventually uncovered a plot in which
Spandine
was scheming some kind of takeover with former Level 6 prisoners from
Impel Down
as well as parties from the
Underworld
. They attacked and destroyed the parties involved and for their efforts were reinstated as agents of Cipher Pol.
