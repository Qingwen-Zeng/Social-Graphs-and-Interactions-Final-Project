Rokushiki

Further information:
Rokushiki
Kibin demonstrated several Rokushiki techniques: Soru, Geppo and Tekkai. Though none of them are offensive, he used them in a clever combination to attack his opponent, recreating the Tekkai: Sai used by
Blueno
, capable of creating a crater in the ground by smashing against it. His Tekkai seems to be average at best, strong enough to shatter the ground with enough momentum added but not enough to take a point blank normal attack from Luffy.

Manga and Anime Differences
[
]
The unnamed Marine officer in the anime.
During the meeting about Luffy's infiltration after the
Summit War of Marineford
in the anime, Kibin was replaced with a unnamed Marine officer with a light tie and blue suit without a scar on his chin, rather than a dark tie and red suit. The only resemblance between this officer and Kibin are their brown hair. In terms of actual resemblance to the manga version of him, he bears little similarity.
