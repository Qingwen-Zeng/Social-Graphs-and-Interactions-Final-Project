Remark was running his store when
Zoro
approached him and asked to go fishing. Remark agreed to take Zoro fishing with him and told him to wait on his fishing boat. However, when Remark arrived at the shore, he saw that Zoro had instead boarded a
pirate
ship
and was sleeping on the deck. He tried to shout at Zoro, but the pirate ship had already been
coated
and it dove underwater. A while later,
Sanji
appeared and asked him what had happened, causing Remark to tell him the story.
