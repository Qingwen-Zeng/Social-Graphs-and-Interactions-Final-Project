Arabasta Arc
[

Chaka, together with Pell, came to the town where pirates were attacking civilians. However,
Crocodile
defeated the pirates before they arrived. As they reached their destination, Crocodile had already beaten the pirates. When the rebellion began to move, Pell and Chaka wanted to fight back but were stopped by
King Cobra
. Later, they found Karoo bringing
Vivi
's letter. From the information, they learned their enemy's identity. As the rebels approached the city, Chaka was commanded to ready the royal army.

A guard reported that the king was missing, causing Chaka to panic. Chaka ordered the Royal Army to search for the king, noting that searching for people was Pell's forte, but that he was scouting the enemies at
Rainbase
. Later, a royal guard reported that they had spotted the king admitting to stealing the rain and giving orders to destroy
Nanohana
. Chaka rejected this as the work of the real king, but the guard replied that the king disappeared from his room around the time of the incident.
As the rebellion started to move, Chaka commanded the royal guard to fight until death for the sake of the king and the princess.
During Crocodile's attack on the kingdom, Chaka attacked the
Warlord of the Sea
alone. Because of Crocodile's actions which forced his men to die without getting the chance to die honorably in battle, Chaka was angered to the point that he attacked Crocodile. However, this was also an attempt to protect Vivi and Koza, as well as buy them time to put an end to the battle - but despite his efforts, he was easily defeated. He survived, however, and showed up later commanding the royal guard to stop fighting.
