Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The bug in the anime.
In the anime, Batchee is replaced by a long brown bug, with two antennae, two little black eyes, ten legs, and two long appendages jutting from his behind. This anime version resembles a silverfish (
thysanura
) if compared with a real insect.
In the anime, Fullbody is shown stepping on Batchee as he crawls under his table before putting Batchee in his soup, presumably killing him. However, in the manga, Fullbody simply states that he put the insect in his soup and it is not shown where he got Batchee from, and he is shown to still be moving in the soup. The manga then shows Batchee on the floor after Fullbody smashes the table, leaving his status unknown.
