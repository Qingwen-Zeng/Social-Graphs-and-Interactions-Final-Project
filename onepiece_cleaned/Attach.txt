Attach
, commonly nicknamed
Attachan
(
アタっちゃん
,
Atatchan
?
, VIZ: "Atacchan")
, is a photojournalist employed by
"Big News" Morgans
for the
World Economy News Paper
.
Having previously headed the
Marines' Photography Department
, he supplied images of many prominent outlaws—including most of the
Straw Hat Pirates
—for the Marines'
wanted posters
,
but was eventually dismissed for his frequent blunders.
Like
Minatomo
, Attach began as an
SBS
joke
Eiichiro Oda
used to "explain" a triviality—namely, how the Marines always had such high-quality illustrations of the
world
's most dangerous and/or unreachable criminals.
In time, however, he became a fully
canon
character, with minor but tangible impact on the story.
Appearance
[
]
Based on a shadowy appearance, Attach is a short and somewhat elderly man with a grayish-brown mustache. He wears a shirt with green-and-white checkered design with white sleeves, black pants, and a white top hat.
After the timeskip, he remained relatively unchanged except that he now wears an armband on his right arm with the words "WE" on it, which likely stand for "World Economic".
Personality
[
]
Not much is known about Attach's personality. He did seem surprised when his boss told him the lens cap was on during Sanji's picture, so he might be confident in his skills of photography. However, it is later revealed that he did indeed leave the lens cap on accidentally, as he was eventually fired for doing so fifty-seven times. Therefore, it can be concluded that he does not pay enough attention while working and that he is a careless person.
Flaming Attachan apparently received his epithet due to the fact that before he closes the shutter, he yells "Fire!".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
According to Oda, Attach is a very skilled infiltrator, able to sneak "anywhere he likes" and photograph (almost) anyone he wants.
It is unknown if he possesses any combat ability, or even any weapons.
As a skilled photographer, Attach was once the chief of the
Marines' Photography Department
, which takes pictures of
pirates
and other criminals for use in
wanted posters
.
However, he was eventually fired for repeated mistakes.

Water 7 Saga
[
]
Attach was present for the
Straw Hat Pirates
' attack on
Enies Lobby
, and—despite the considerable chaos—successfully photographed
Sogeking
,
Tony Tony Chopper
,
Nico Robin
, and
Franky
. However, his attempts to photograph
Sanji
were thwarted by numerous mishaps, culminating in a "successful" shot where he realized too late that he had forgotten to remove the lens-cap.
Post Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
After the fall of Enies Lobby, Attach followed the Straw Hats and their allies back to
Water 7
. Finding the whole city hailing the Straw Hats as heroes, he was able to trick
Nami
into posing for a photograph by claiming to be a reporter for a local newspaper.
Within a week, he reported back to his superiors with the new photographs, but was forced to submit a blank for Sanji.
This led to the Marines using a crude facial composite for Sanji's wanted poster—a situation that greatly displeased Sanji, but ironically protected him for a time, as it led to his
birth family
being stymied by false leads such as
Duval
.
Whole Cake Island Saga

]
Some time after the
Summit War of Marineford
, Attach was dismissed by the Marines for his fifty-seventh instance of forgetting to remove his camera's lens-cap.
