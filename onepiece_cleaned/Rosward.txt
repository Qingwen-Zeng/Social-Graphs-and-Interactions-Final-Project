Saint Rosward
is one of the
World Nobles
who reside in the
Holy City of Mary Geoise
. He is the father of
Shalria
and
Charlos
.
Alongside his son and daughter, he is one of the main antagonists of the
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Saint Rosward is an older man with a hairstyle that curls upward, traditional for Celestial Dragons. He has a curly black mustache and a fluffy gray beard, and wears black shades, which were shattered when Usopp fell on him.
Like all other World Nobles, Rosward wears a thick white suit with medal-like knobs and a bubble over his head to prevent himself from breathing the same air as the commoners. His suit included a thick white cape, and actual medals next to the knobs. He also wields a walking cane that is revealed to be a rifle. In Mary Geoise, he is seen carrying a mallet.
Personality
[
]
Rosward is noted to be the most-responsible of his family yet seen; as seen when he scolded his children for their behavior.
Though he scolds his children and appears concerned, he is merely maintaining the appearance of their power and acts in a misanthropic, elitist manner almost even more so than his children. Although he has "never hit his son", he was livid at Luffy after he assaulted Charlos, for having the gall to directly affront their position. Like his daughter Shalria, he has deep pride in his ancestry.
He apparently has a "Pirate Captain collection" (which included
Devil Dias
and
Jean Bart
), and does nothing to stop or alter the treatment that his children give to others.
Rosward has shown to be extremely cruel and brutal as he enjoyed torturingÂ an enslaved
Bartholomew Kuma
while referring to the latter as a top class slave due to his inability to scream or cry.
Like his children, his belief in his untouchable status as a World Noble seems to render him incapable of realizing the danger around him, even when completely obvious. Despite the fact that Luffy brutally punched his son Charlos across the room, Rosward's only reaction is anger, rather than fear of someone who could and would cause him serious harm if provoked, as if he were somehow incapable of being harmed himself. He shot pointlessly at Luffy several times with his cane-rifle until disarmed by Sanji, at which point he apparently realized that the Straw Hats would not be cowed into submission, instead calling for a Marine Admiral to deal with them.
Regardless, he still took the threat head-on instead of acting out of cowardly self-preservation, although it's most likely due to his aforementioned belief in his untouchable nature. His pride in the Celestial Dragon heritage is that he despises any of his brethren for not honoring their bloodlines, such as those of the Donquixote Family, specifically Homing and Mjosgard.

Family

Charlos

son
, although he does reprimand him for spending so much money to the point of being considered a "waste".

After Sai and Leo smashed Charlos for his persistently attempted to capture
Shirahoshi
, Rosward became furious similar what happened in Sabaody.
Shalria
[
]
Rosward gets along well with his
daughter
, although he does reprimand her for continuously depleting his "Pirate Captain Collection".
Other World Nobles
[
]
Rosward, being proud of the title of Celestial Dragon, looks down on any fellow Celestial Dragons who do not honor the heritage. As such, he expresses disdain at the
Donquixote Family
, due to
Homing
's choice to relieve his own family of their statuses to live among the common masses.
Mjosgard
's newfound benevolence due to
Otohime
's influence further inclined Rosward to believe the Donquixote Family to be utter disgraces to the rest of the World Nobles.
Enemies
[
]
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
After Luffy punched his son Charlos, Rosward became furious and attempted to shoot him with his rifle cane. As the Straw Hats fought back against his guards, Rosward summoned an Admiral in retaliation.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being a World Noble, Rosward has the authority to act as he pleases without fear of legal repercussion. He also possesses tremendous wealth, having bought a "Pirate Captain Collection" of slaves that his daughter can manhandle callously,
and his son spending
500,000,000 on a
mermaid
.
He has tremendous political influence, more so than any royalty of the
Levely
, and the power to summon an Admiral of the Marines in the event he feels his authority alone would not inflict submission.
Due to being spoiled by his heritage, Rosward has no fighting skills whatsoever, as he could not hit a stationary Luffy with his firearm even at moderate range, and Sanji easily disarmed him. His endurance and durability was very low, as he was taken out when Usopp fell on top of him.
Weapons
[
]
He wields a
gun built into his cane
, but could not manage to hit Luffy from a mediocre distance, even though Luffy was stationary.
History

Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
He is first seen with his daughter, Saint
Shalria
, looking down on his runaway-blown up slave,
Devil Dias
, who was the Captain of the
Acumate Pirates
. After his dog urinates on the man, his daughter shoots him with a gun, displaying no remorse afterwards.
A demon-like man is seen behind him, who is later revealed to be pirate captain
Jean Bart
.
He is then seen at the
Human Auctioning House
, with his son Saint
Charlos
and daughter Saint
Shalria
. While claiming that he is merely visiting as an audience, Charlos bid
500,000,000 on
Camie
, which led Rosward to be displeased with his son.
Sanji disarms Rosward.
When his son was attacked by
Luffy
, he used his cane (which is a concealed rifle) and started shooting randomly around Luffy, then shouted out for someone to call for an
Admiral
.
Sanji
kicks the cane out of hand, followed by
Usopp
knocking him unconscious by accidentally falling down from the rooftop and smashing his face into the floor.
He was later seen unconscious together with his son when Shalria scolds the marines for being unable to capture the Straw Hat Pirates.
