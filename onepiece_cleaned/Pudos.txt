History

Wano Country Saga

Wano Country Arc
[

Pudos was near the entrance to the Prisoner Mine when one of his crewmates wondered about a poisonous fish he was feeding to the mysterious occupant of a certain cell (which was in fact the samurai
Kawamatsu
). Pudos stated he did not know who the prisoner was, but did know that they were required to remove the bones first. The pirate
Monkey D. Luffy
was then led into the mine as the newest prisoner, and Pudos approached him, noticing a fiery look in Luffy's eyes and expressing a desire to break his spirit. Luffy then glared at Pudos, which offended the guard and caused him to move to attack the pirate. However, Kawamatsu then spit out the skeleton of the fish he ate, which had not been removed that day, into Pudos' neck, causing the pirate to wail in pain as blood gushed out of him.
