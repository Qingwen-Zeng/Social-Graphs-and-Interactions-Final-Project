"Ship Cutter" T Bone
was a
Marine
Vice Admiral
.
As a Marine
Captain
two years ago, he was a minor antagonist during the
Water 7 Arc
and confronted the
Straw Hat Pirates
on the
Sea Train
route to
Enies Lobby
. Prior to joining the Marines, he was a royal knight.
Sometime around the
Egghead Arc
, T Bone was killed in the
Pepe Kingdom
for the bounty he received from the
Cross Guild
.
Appearance
[
]
T Bone had curly long black hair, a skeletal face, and a long neck, and was missing one tooth. He was pot-bellied with muscular arms and thin legs. Even after becoming a Marine, his overall appearance mirrored his former occupation: he was clad in golden, sleeveless chain mail armor with an ornately decorated collar and he wore a helmet with a long, flowing purple plume on the top. Over his cuirass, he had a tunic emblazoned with the Marine symbol. He had a rope belt tied around his waist, similar to the ones worn by some samurai. His attire was completed by standard light-blue pants and shoes. It should be noted that many elements of his outfit had one or more crosses on them: his helmet, the pendants hanging from his belt, and his sword's hilt.
He carried around his signature weapon, a decorated sword reminiscent of the ones used by
Templars
in popular fiction, either on his right hip (suggesting he may have been left-handed or ambidextrous) or hanging from his back.
Also, instead of wearing the standard officer's Marine coat, he had a high-collared mantle with the kanji for "justice"
(
正義
,
Seigi
?
)
printed on it. He tore it to pieces during the travel on the Puffing Tom in order to treat his injured comrades;
however, he seemed to have repaired it or have gotten a new one in his appearance in the
Marineford Arc
.
After the Summit War, he grew a very horizontal straight line mustache and two lined beard on his chin.
In his younger days in the Marines, he had shorter hair and sported a standard Marine cap.
Personality
[
]
Contradicting his gaunt and withered facial appearance, T Bone was a very honorable and considerate person, and he absolutely abhorred needless violence. His main fault was his tendency to take life very seriously - although he valued the soldiers under his command, he had a tendency to fuss over their minor problems in a melodramatic manner, which could make them uncomfortable. He was noted for being far too willing to sacrifice himself, even when the situation did not call for something so drastic. Apparently, he had a penchant for dramatic phrasing, and he often spoke about honor and justice. He believed very strongly that it is a Marine's duty to protect innocent people. He had a very strong will that was shown when he left his detached train car and ran across the train tracks completely indifferent to the storm going around him. He believed every criminal he let get away leaves an innocent person in danger. Because of this, he did anything and everything in his power to catch them even if it meant claiming his own life.
He claimed to dislike curved swords, such as
Zoro
's.
His own sword-fighting style even reflected a lack of crooked swings, preferring to slash in straight motions or sharp right angles.
T Bone's motto was "Do 100 good deeds every day", and because he disliked unnecessary violence so much and wished to protect life, he was also a vegan.
Relationships
[
]
Marines
[
]
Being a Marine Vice Admiral and previously a Rear Admiral and Captain, T Bone had many Marines under his command. He valued the soldiers under his command and was shown to care for their well-being to the point of melodramatically worrying about their minor problems, making them uncomfortable.
That aside, his men showed great admiration for him, believing he could defeat any enemy. He put their safety as a high priority, going back to warn them about Sanji, Franky, and Usopp's trap rather than saving himself or chasing the Straw Hats.
He also saved them from the Sea King that attacked their detached car.
They, in turn, were determined to help him after he was defeated by Zoro; however, this was only seen in the anime.
While he was honorable among his colleagues, T Bone was intimidated by Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
while reporting about
Fujitora's
presence at
Mary Geoise
.
When Sengoku and Tsuru found out his death caused by the Cross Guild, they were shocked and saddened by that event as they noted him to be a well-beloved and noble Marine.
Enemies
[
]
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
T Bone recognized Zoro as the Pirate Hunter upon seeing him on the upcoming train but decided to confront him in order to protect his subordinates. Zoro acknowledged that T Bone is a strong swordsman, and during their brief battle, it seemed that they both developed some respect for each other's strength. Zoro even apologized for not being able to stop and save T Bone from the sea, but he explained that saving his
friend
was more important than justice.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
T Bone was well reputed within the Marines which is why he was permanently stationed at their
headquarters
at
Marineford
and later
New Marineford
where he reported directly to the higher brass.
Physical Abilities
[
]
T Bone was extremely strong and resistant: his thin and apparently frail legs allowed him to run for a long time on the
Sea Train
's rails during a storm. He was struck by a hit strong enough to destroy his own sword without receiving permanent damage. The force he applied in his sword strikes could cut through metal trains, large ships, and even giant
Sea Kings
in half. Also, Zoro commented to himself twice that T Bone was strong, and the fact that their fight lasted only moments does not mean he was inferior to Zoro at all (at that point the fight could only be settled in mere moments as the Rocketman was racing towards the rails T Bone was standing on).
Swordsmanship
[
]
T Bone was renowned for his incredible mastery in
swordsmanship
: he was capable of generating flying slashes from the force of his sword strikes, something only the strongest swordsmen like
Roronoa Zoro
and
Dracule Mihawk
have been capable of. His sword strikes were powerful enough to cut through trains, boats, and Sea Kings.
T Bone was known as the "Ship-Cutter"
(
船斬り
,
Funekiri
?
)
for his prowess in swordsmanship; according to Zambai, T Bone could easily slice large ships like cutting steaks.
Weapons
[
]
Further information:
Bamboo
T Bone wielded a sword called
Bamboo
.
It is a sword with a perfectly straight blade and is finely decorated, as well as the hilt. During his fight with Zoro, his sword was broken in two by the pirate. It was presumably fixed by the time of the
Summit War of Marineford
.
Haki

Haki
It was stated that all vice admirals possess
Haki
, so T Bone can also use the ability.

Past
[
]
Before joining the Marines, T Bone was a royal knight. The country he served is unknown.
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
T Bone was assigned to help escort the
CP9
agents to
Enies Lobby
, the Judicial Headquarters of the
World Government
on the
Grand Line
, where T Bone is usually stationed. He was stationed in the 5th car of the
Puffing Tom
alongside 40 of his men. When he and his men faintly heard the
Straw Hat Pirates
in the car behind them, T Bone stood to defend them as a precaution.
T Bone noticed that one of his underlings was injured (the Marine had a bleeding bug bite), so he called the man to stand at attention. T Bone tore part of his cape off and gave it to the Marine. After receiving word from another Marine soldier that the 6th and 7th cars' guards had been defeated and that the prisoners escaped, T Bone and his men moved to another car in order to assist those knocked out by
Sanji
.
T Bone tended to the wounds of the 7th car guards, tearing more of his cape off. As they were doing so, Sanji, Franky, and Usopp knocked on the door and greeted the guards before quickly closing and sealing the door of the car T Bone and his men were standing in. The Captain cut it clean with his
Chokkaku Senkō: Bone Soir
and started chasing them on the train's roof. T Bone realized that they had fallen into a trap, but his efforts to escape to the cars ahead was futile; he and his men were separated from the other passengers when the Straw Hats and the cyborg detached their cars from the train.
T Bone is defeated by Zoro.
After killing a
Sea King
that assaulted their car with one blow, T Bone started running along the tracks by himself, seeking help and chasing the train. He encountered a Sea King on his path, but he cut it in half and continued. He was then reached by the
Rocketman
, and after exchanging some words with
Roronoa Zoro
, he battled him on the rails, attacking him with his
Chokkaku Hichō: Bone Ōdorī
. Despite his skills, he was defeated by the
Straw Hat Pirates
swordsman's
Gyūki: Yuzume
. Zoro's blow destroyed T Bone's blade and knocked him into the sea as the Rocketman sped down the tracks.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, T Bone is shown floating in the sea and thinking about his defeat, as his men approached to assist him, rowing on the car bifurcated by Zoro.
In the manga, T Bone's death is neither shown nor stated how it occurred. The anime explicitly depicts him being stabbed by a citizen of the Pepe Kingdom in local chaos.
