Appearance
[
]
Garp is a tall, tanned, broad-chested, muscular old man. He has a beard and a scar over his left eye. In the anime, his eye color is blue, and his hair is gray, whereas in the manga, it is white. Garp and
Tsuru
are the only two Vice Admirals to have special shoulder-pads; Garp is golden and blue (black and red in the anime) while Tsuru is purple with white dot whereas the standard color is blue and red. During the Battle of Edd War, Garp's had two black stripes on his epaulettes, and during his appearance at Water 7, it increased to three stripes and by the time of the Marineford War, it increased again to four stripes.
The dog mask that Garp initially wore when introduced served to hide his identity as Luffy's grandfather, whose design had appeared in
Romance Dawn, Version 2
. After their relationship was revealed in the
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
, Garp is no longer seen wearing the mask.
In his free time or vacation, Garp often wears sandals, a red tropical shirt and light-colored shorts. He sometimes pairs this shirt with black trousers and boots.
When visiting Dadan during Luffy's childhood, he sometimes wears his official black suit without wearing his Marine cape.
Thirty-eight years ago, Garp's hair was all black and lacked a goatee. He wore a white dress shirt and a red tie.
Thirty years ago, Garp's hair and goatee were all black. He wore a dark suit with an orange striped undershirt and a black tie.
Twenty-four years ago, Garp's hair and goatee were still black, with sideburns beginning to whiten. He wore a dark double-breasted suit with a white shirt and a red necktie.
When he was a child and a young man, Garp resembled Luffy, though more muscular than his grandson. As a child, he had light brown hair, wore a tropical button shirt with shorts, and wielded a pipe staff. Garp already had the scar on his left eye in his childhood days.
After the timeskip, his appearance has somewhat remained the same though he now wears a dark-colored suit (still white in the anime).

Personality
[
]
Garp is an eccentric but righteous and caring man, who is loyal to both his criminal family and the Marine Headquarters, who he has served for decades. He is loud, boisterous, exuberant, and overall acts in a similar manner to his grandson, however he can be very serious if the situation requires it, for example in combat against an enemy (this can be seen when he faced the pirate Shiki alongside Sengoku, and also more recently when he had to fight against Aokiji, his former pupil). He has a habit of falling asleep during conversations and can be absent-minded. Luffy's crew noted his apparently hereditary selfishness during Garp's interaction with Luffy in Water 7.
Despite being a righteous man, Garp takes great pride in being a Marine despite knowing how corrupt the Marines are under the World Government, and wanted his family to follow his footsteps, as his son Dragon previously joined the Marines but left due to being disgusted by their corruption and hypocrisy, he also harshly trained his grandsons in order to make them splendid Marines and would beat them up whenever they defied his wishes by wanting to be pirates.
Garp is aware of the World Government's immense corruption and tyrannical influence over the world and society, particularly of the Celestial Dragons' cruelty and oppression of civilians but held a lenient and laid-back stance on it, believing as long as there is no open bloodshed, even if there are social discrimination and political corruption, he can call it peace, contrary to his son's rebellious stance against political corruption.
Unlike many Marines, Garp does not believe that a person's lineage determines their path. On a similar note, he does not believe that being labeled a criminal necessarily makes someone a bad person. Although Garp wanted his grandsons to become Marines, he entrusted their care to a
mountain bandit
whom he had refused to turn over for prosecution.
Garp's "Fist of Love"
Garp believes that throwing children into harsh conditions will ultimately make them strong and has no problem striking children to drive home a point. His grandson, Luffy, for example, stated that Garp almost killed him several times when he was a child under the guise of making him strong. Despite this, Garp is a supportive person. When Ace asked Garp whether he should have been born, Garp replies that Ace will find the answer if he continues living. When Momousagi mentioned Luffy being targeted by two Emperors, Garp did not express much concern about it.
His harsh discipline extends to himself as he forced himself through an extremely harsh and unorthodox training method of punching battleships since his youth.
Although Garp will ultimately comply with Marine HQ's most serious orders, he highly values his freedom and family. Often to a point where he bends the rules to accommodate these values. He initially refused to capture Luffy in Water 7 until explicitly ordered to do so. Despite fulfilling his duties, Garp has a strong Moral Code to follow, which according to Sengoku is the main reason why Garp refused the promotion as an Admiral multiple times, as his code dictates that it is not his duty to protect Celestial Dragons. Additionally, Garp is generally amused by Luffy's exploits as a pirate, and only seriously laments both of his grandsons' choices to become pirates after Ace is captured. He ultimately allowed Luffy to hit him due to valuing his family more than his duty as a Marine during the war at Marineford. He even seemed ready to defend them when Akainu executed Ace and was on the verge of killing Luffy.
Like Luffy, Garp is extremely blunt and honest when talking to people as seen when he openly badmouthed
Sterry
, the current king of the Goa Kingdom, unafraid of the consequences. He considers the Celestial Dragons scumbags and is not afraid of expressing this vocally. The main reason he refused to become an admiral is because he does not want to be their direct subordinate. On one occasion, he also blurted out Monkey D. Dragon's name in front of Luffy, his friends, and his subordinates without any consideration at Water 7. When he realized he should not have said that he just simply laughed it off, and shamelessly asked those who heard it to forget it.
Garp believes in the potential of youth and sees it as a Marine's duty to protect the future. This is the first lesson he teaches to Marine recruits, even telling them in a situation where they have to choose between saving an old man and a baby; they should leave the old man behind on the dangerous island and save the baby because the old man doesn't have much time left while the baby and them have a whole future ahead of them. While his fellow Marine instructor told him never to repeat this lesson, Garp stood by it. He would display his commitment to this by launching a rescue mission to save Koby after he was taken to Hachinosu by Blackbeard, declaring Koby the future of the Marines. At the end of the raid, he showed his faith in Koby,
Prince Grus
and
Helmeppo
by entrusting them to save the Marine ship from
Avalo Pizarro
's
attack
while he stayed behind to allow them to escape, calling all of them the "future of the Marines".
When Garp prepares to fight seriously, he often removes his Marine coat
or a suit jacket.
Like his grandson, Garp is extremely fond of food, especially donuts, rice crackers and meat.
Garp has his own
laughter style
: Bwahaha or Wahaha.
Garp follows "My Justice"

.
Relationships
[
]
Marines
[
]
As the "Hero of the Marines", Garp is overall very well-respected for cornering the
Pirate King
multiple times. While Garp seems devoted to his duties, he has his own sense of justice and does not always obey orders which are given to him. Both Garp's immense popularity and achievements are noted by Sengoku to be the reason Garp was never disposed of for his rebellious attitude. He was requested to remain behind as an instructor due to his fame, which will be invaluable in recruiting, Garp has problems with respecting his superiors and such is the case with then-Fleet Admiral
Kong
27 years ago, and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku. Even including the fact that Garp was about to try to kill Akainu for killing Ace, it seems that this has not affected Garp's standing in the Marines even after his relationship with both Dragon and Luffy was revealed to the world, as Kong insisted that Garp's title and records can be utilized to recruit new Marines.
Crew
[
]
Garp's crew often reacts with shock or uncertainty to his behavior. At times he seems to be unaware of the true extent of what is going on around him. After ordering his crew to rebuild a wall that Garp himself had just destroyed, his crew refused to do so unless he helped as well. This insubordinate behavior was displayed amongst a Marine crew, but Garp complied with their demand. Despite Garp telling his crew about his relationship with Luffy and Dragon, most Marines were unaware of it until the war with Whitebeard, suggesting that his men kept it a secret.
Garp's right hand man is a Marine of unknown rank, who is usually seen with him. In the anime, his name is
Bogard
, although his name has not been revealed in the manga as of yet. It seems that Garp and Bogard have been together for at least 38 years.
Koby and Helmeppo
[
]
Additionally, Garp is the mentor of
Koby
and
Helmeppo
, who both came to admire him. He was shocked when Koby shouted out to stop the killing at Marineford during the war with Whitebeard.
When Koby was captured by the Blackbeard Pirates after his failed attempt to arrest
Boa Hancock
, he plans on going to rescue him, disregarding protocol. Garp acknowledged Koby to be his beloved pupil. Due to knowing Koby's relentless determination and effort during the early days of his training, Garp had high expectations for Koby calling him the future of the Marines. Upon seeing Koby awaken his potential by destroying Pizzaro's giant Island hand, Garp wholeheartedly laughed, content to witness his beloved pupil's growth.
Sengoku
[
]
A typical moment between Garp and Sengoku.
As a hero of the Marines, Garp commands high respect among the Marines, even from then-
Fleet Admiral
Sengoku
. In the past, Garp and Sengoku seemed to be very good friends, albeit that Sengoku was a little annoyed with Garp's tendency to act of his own accord whenever Roger was involved. Currently, as with the revelation that both
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Portgas D. Ace
are Garp's grandsons (Ace being adopted), as well as Luffy's multiple actions in such a short time, Sengoku has begun losing patience with Garp. But the two Marines still share a close friendship even though Sengoku is often exasperated at Garp's antics, like his offering of tea to Sengoku and
Kuma
while discussing Luffy's actions at
Thriller Bark
.
Garp, on the other hand, seems to merely laugh it off and enjoys getting on Sengoku's nerves. Notably, Sengoku's biggest annoyance was Garp's refusal to keep his family under control even when threatened with the consequences. Garp simply does not believe the life of an old man could ever atone for the actions of his family. When or how long Sengoku knew of Garp adopting Ace is unknown, but Sengoku found out that Ace is the son of
Gol D. Roger
. Also, how long Sengoku knew about Luffy and Dragon's familial relationship to Garp is unknown, but Sengoku had no problem revealing all of it worldwide.
When Garp allowed Luffy to land a punch on him to save Ace, many of the surrounding Marines were shocked to see what they believe to be an impossibility: the legendary Garp was easily defeated by a rookie. Sengoku, however, was able to tell of Garp's hesitancy, and was displeased that he chose family over duty.
After the
Summit War of Marineford
, Garp and Sengoku retired but their records remained untouched.
Tsuru
[
]
Garp is well acquainted with
Tsuru
having known her for a long time. Before the Summit War of Marineford occurred, she told him that he had done nothing wrong regarding Ace, which Garp replied to with laughter, saying that she was supposed to be sympathetic towards him during this situation.
Sakazuki
[
]
Sakazuki did not show any respect to Garp despite the old
Vice Admiral
being a "Hero of the Marines" who was eligible for the position of admiral due to him being from the previous generation, but mostly for sharing the same lineage with criminals like Dragon and Luffy.​​ Garp in turn also has no respect for Sakazuki even though he is now the fleet admiral, nor does he consider it. He claimed to Sengoku that he would have mercilessly killed Sakazuki for executing Ace if he was not restrained by the former.
World Government
[
]
Kong
[
]
Garp and Kong are well acquainted with each other, due to the latter being the former Fleet Admiral years ago. Kong respects Garp's abilities, as he always insisted that Garp accept the promotion to Admiral, but Garp constantly declined. They remain acquainted even after Kong became the Commander-in-Chief for the World Government. After the Marineford War, Kong reassigned Garp to the rank of Marine Instructor after he succeeded in persuading Garp to stay in the Marines and train new recruits.
World Nobles
[
]
Though he is a Marine and is loyal to the World Government, Garp is disgusted by the World Nobles and refused the promotion to admiral due to the fact it would make him their direct subordinate.
He has no hesitancy in degrading the Celestial Dragons in front of others of importance, such as
King
Sterry
, only halfheartedly taking back the insult and went as far as directly calling them scumbags for their cruel and heinous natures. The only reason why the World Nobles did not dispose of him for his rebellious personality was due to his popularity and merits.
Family
[
]
Monkey D. Dragon
[
]
Dragon
is Garp's son.
No direct interactions between the two have been shown. In the past, he expressed discontent about his own son leaving the Marines and becoming a
Revolutionary
,
though over the years he seems much more casual about his son's path as a Revolutionary who is wanted by the
World Government
. There appears to be some sort of understanding between the two, as Garp was aware that the reason Dragon was in
Loguetown
was to see Luffy set off for the
Grand Line
.
After the
Summit War of Marineford
, he was not fazed by the fact that his relationship with Dragon became public knowledge. It also seems his reputation as a hero hasn’t been tarnished by this revelation.
Garp and Dragon have different assessments of the East Blue. While Garp perceives it as a rather peaceful place, Dragon expresses his disgust with Garp's view of "peace" as nothing more than a form of oppression authorized by the law in places, such as
Tequila Wolf
and the
Goa Kingdom
, where common people live in horrible conditions.
Ultimately, Garp has an extremely different ideology from his son. While Garp takes pride and contentment in being a Marine serving the World Government, Dragon absolutely despises the World Government to the point of becoming a Revolutionary and seeking to overthrow them. However, they are unified in one belief – disdain toward the
Celestial Dragons
.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Garp appears on the news about Luffy's return.
Garp raised his grandson
Luffy
and sets high standards for him,
and gets mad at the slightest mistake he makes, even when his own are sometimes no better (i.e., telling off Luffy for falling asleep only to fall asleep himself). This often leads Luffy to receiving the force of Garp's punches, and due to these experiences, he has become afraid of his grandfather. Garp also claims Luffy was poisoned by
Shanks
with ideas of becoming a pirate, as Garp wanted Luffy to be a great Marine like him. Luffy, however, claims otherwise and told Garp that even as a child he wanted to be a
pirate
.
Nevertheless, the two get along quite well. As
Nami
stated at the time of Garp's departure, that there seems to be an amazing ego that runs in Garp's family. Garp left Luffy in Dadan's care as a child, which is how Luffy met Ace.
Garp appears proud when Luffy commits outrageous acts and found it amusing when he learned that Luffy had infiltrated the great prison Impel Down in an attempt to rescue Ace. When he learned that Luffy had broken out of Impel Down (taking many infamous prisoners along with him) and headed straight to Marineford, where the marines were currently waging war against Whitebeard and his crew, Garp was shocked. He was even more shocked when Luffy, along with an entire battleship of prisoners, fell off a frozen tsunami and into the war front.
This shows that he cares for his grandson's well-being. He later calmed himself as the battle went on and simply watched as Luffy fought the marines, throughout which he seemed distraught whenever Luffy was struck down by various powerful soldiers. When Sengoku made Luffy's relationship to Dragon public, Garp simply states that Luffy already has such widespread notoriety that his connection to Dragon is irrelevant. Garp expressed surprise at Luffy's ability to use
Haoshokou Haki
before commenting that Luffy inherited it after all. When Luffy was on the verge of saving Ace, Garp blocked him and refused to move, citing his Marine duties. Despite this, Garp allowed Luffy to hit him without fighting back.
After the timeskip, Garp does not seem to be troubled by his grandson's growing infamy. This was demonstrated when he was not the least bit concerned that two of the
Four Emperors
are after him, even laughing at the idea of the emperors actually teaming up over something.
Portgas D. Ace
[
]
Garp visiting an imprisoned Ace.
Garp adopted
Ace
from
Gol D. Roger
, who requested him to take care of his son while adding that Ace does not deserve to be treated as a criminal just because of his family ties. While Garp initially thought of adopting Ace as a preposterous idea, he eventually agreed to Roger's final wish, as the latter pointed out that after multiple confrontations, he trusted the vice admiral as much as a friend. Indeed, Garp was troubled when Ace was about to face death and claimed he had no pity for a pirate, but believed family is different. He cares about him deeply, crying for his grandson as he was about to be executed for being a pirate and desperately asking why he could not have just been a Marine. In fact, after Akainu killed Ace, Garp was more than willing to kill him in revenge, and the only reason he didn't follow through was because he was restrained by Sengoku.
When Ace was an infant, Garp would use his vacation time to visit the village often and make funny faces to cheer him up. Despite the fact that Ace was a troubled child that would beat up anyone who insulted his father, Garp seemed amused with Ace, yet never scolded him for his actions as a part of him felt sad that the child did not fully accept Roger as his father. After Luffy, Sabo and Ace had gotten along well, Garp would sometimes visit them and train them by beating them up and destroying most of the forest in the process.
As with Luffy, Garp had high expectations for Ace to be a strong Marine but is disappointed that he chose the life of piracy, which incidentally sent him to
Impel Down
where they were speaking about the issue. Ace refused to acknowledge the idea that he and his younger brother could have ever been Marines, considering their fathers' restless blood in their veins.
Enemies
[
]
Gol D. Roger
[
]
Back when
Gol D. Roger
was alive, Garp managed to corner him numerous times.
As such, they have a long history against each other with the exception to the
Rocks Pirates
. Garp was one of two Marines that Roger considered to be worth his time, the other being Sengoku.
Due to their countless clashes, Roger came to see Garp as much a friend as the rest of his crew.
Garp too had respect for him, as he not only protected Ace but also showed signs of disappointment from Ace's decision to disregard Roger being his father. Garp also acknowledged Roger's strength, stating that although Roger was extremely reckless, this is what made him become the King of the Pirates. Garp also told Dadan that although he is a Marine, he could never come to hate Roger.
When Roger was about to be executed after turning himself in due to his terminal illness, he made a final request to Garp. He asked Garp to take care of his unborn child, as he did not deserve to be condemned as a criminal because of his father's crimes, something they both agreed on.
While Garp had initially wanted to make Ace into a Marine rather than a pirate like Roger, he still wanted Ace to be proud of his biological father. Though in the end, Garp had no success in this endeavor either.
Edward Newgate
[
]
Whitebeard
respected Garp and acknowledged his strength when he addressed him by his own real name, and not "brat" unlike Crocodile, Akainu, Aokiji, Kizaru, Shanks, and many others (though Garp was more in the same age group as Whitebeard, being 4 years older than him). Garp did not let Marco pass through to get to Ace's execution platform meaning he did not care how fearsome Whitebeard could be after seeing that, which is due to not only having fought Whitebeard's rival the Pirate King but also Whitebeard himself during the
God Valley Incident
.
While the two are on opposite sides, Garp shares similar views with Whitebeard. They don't believe a child should be condemned or hated because of what their parents did, nor would they hate someone simply because they were enemies with their parents. They also believe it's their duty to raise and protect the next generation.
Chinjao
[
]
Chinjao
was an infamous pirate who took deep pride in his pointed head, which Garp was determined to break. Garp and Chinjao had multiple battles in the past.
After he trained by leveling eight mountains with his fists, Garp successfully dented Chinjao's head in a confrontation, depriving the latter of the means to access all of his stored treasures. This led to Chinjao holding a grudge so strong against Garp that it extended to all of his descendants and lasted over 30 years. Chinjao lifted his grudge and forgave Garp when the latter's grandson, Luffy, punched his head hard enough to return it to its former glory.
Chinjao also reveals that in Garp's younger days, he was like a "demon" to pirates.
Shanks
[
]
Garp bears a grudge against
Shanks
, because Garp believes he is the one who influenced his grandson, Monkey D. Luffy, to become a pirate.
When seeing him at Marineford, Garp was greatly angered by his presence and deepened his grudge against Shanks for inspiring his grandson to be a pirate.
Despite his resentment, Garp did not stop Shanks from giving his late grandson Ace a proper burial after he requested it.
Rocks D. Xebec
[
]
Before Roger's era,
Rocks
was his enemy. There was a conflict at God Valley that required Garp to team up with Roger in order to put an end to his reign of terror.
Kuzan
[
]
Garp is the former mentor of
Kuzan
, during their time in the Marines.
Kuzan, in particular, owes a large part of his physical strength due to Garp's training and has been indebted to Garp due to a certain incident that involved Garp saving his life, and is impressed that Garp refused several promotions.
At
Hachinosu
Garp confronted his former student, who had since become a member of the
Blackbeard Pirates
, he demanded Kuzan to come back to the Marines, unfreeze
Hibari
and let them leave with Koby. However, Kuzan rejected Garp's plea and refused to return to the Marines due to his hatred towards
Sakazuki
.
The two traded blows as they argued. Garp grew frustrated by Kuzan's stubbornness and told him that he should consider himself expelled as a pupil
. The battle ended when Kuzan delivered what he thought would be a finishing blow, and pierced Garp's chest with a massive icicle. In the end Kuzan appeared dismayed because he failed to kill his former mentor.
Other Pirates
[
]
Over his many years as a Marine hero, Garp has made many enemies with pirates over the sea, such as
Shiki
and
Shakky
.
He felt neither remorse nor pity for any of these pirates, as they are criminals.
Others
[
]
Curly Dadan
[
]
It is unknown how they met, but they have known each other for at least 22 years, since Garp was seen entrusting a newborn
Portgas D. Ace
to her.
As
Curly Dadan
is the leader of a
bandit group
, Garp blackmailed her to watch over Ace and Luffy as their foster mother, in exchange that he will turn a blind eye on their criminal activities, which is said to equal the numbers of stars in the sky. Despite Dadan having a fear and irritation against the vice admiral for leaving two children in her care, Garp claims that Dadan is a friend of his. This is ironic, as Garp claimed that he has no sympathy for criminals and will arrest them with ease. Even in more recent times, Garp and Dadan continue to show a violent relationship that likewise harbors respect for each other and for the work they had in connection with both Luffy and Ace.
Even though Dadan usually fears him, she did not have a problem attacking Garp for not managing to save Ace. In turn, Garp did not resist as he understood her grief.
Sabo
[
]
Little is known about Garp's relationship with
Sabo
, beyond the fact that Garp trained him along with Luffy and Ace. Sabo noted that Garp tried to keep the three brothers on a short leash, implying that he gave Sabo similar treatment to Ace and Luffy.
This is expanded in the anime when Luffy told Garp he, Sabo, and Ace had exchanged cups of sake. He then declared that there were three fools in need of a lesson and decided to "train" Sabo alongside Luffy and Ace.
Sterry
[
]
As the ruler of the
Goa Kingdom
,
Sterry
expected absolute obedience and respect from Garp since he is one of its citizens. However, the old Marine showed neither to the young
king
, not even knowing who he was and even telling him to get lost and calling him ugly. When he was told of Sterry's position, he only half-heartedly took back much of what he said. He even looked down on Sterry's desire to become a Celestial Dragon and bluntly expressed this aloud.
Neptune Family
[
]
Garp became acquainted with
Neptune
's family, notably Neptune and
Shirahoshi
due to being Luffy's grandfather. When they parted, Garp happily waved goodbye to the mermaid princess.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Even at an advanced age, Garp has enough raw strength and power to devastate an island.
Garp is considered a living legend and is one of the strongest Marines of all time. In his heyday he was famous for cornering
Gol D. Roger
many times,
as he was one of the very few people capable of fighting the Pirate King.
In fact, Roger states that he and Garp had almost killed each other many times throughout their battles.
Due to his incredible power and popularity, Garp was offered the rank of
Admiral
several times throughout his life but refused the promotion every time.
This is even more impressive given the fact that most admirals are shown to have powerful (mostly
Logia
-type) Devil Fruit powers. As a testament to his strength, together with Roger he fought and defeated the
Rocks Pirates
, one of the strongest pirate crews in history that featured Roger's most formidable rival,
Rocks D. Xebec
; three future Emperors,
Edward Newgate
,
Charlotte Linlin
, and
Kaidou
; and other legendary pirates such as
Shiki the Golden Lion
. This tremendous feat earned Garp the title of
"Hero of the Marines"
.
Despite his advanced age, his power and reputation are so immense that
Cross Guild
has given him a bounty of
3,000,000,000, the same bounty as an Admiral.
As another testament to his sheer power, Garp defeated and nearly killed Don
Chinjao
in the past with a single punch, whose bounty was worth
542,000,000 in his prime and was said to be able to split a continent with a headbutt, this earned him the epithet,
"Garp the Fist"
.
Chinjao himself said that during that time, all the pirates saw Garp as a "Devil" to them.
Even at the ripe age of 76, he was shown to be able to easily strike down
Marco the Phoenix
, Whitebeard's right hand, which was something that both
Kizaru
and
Akainu
seemed unable to do. In fact, during the War after Ace's death, Akainu would possibly have been killed by a furious Garp had
Sengoku
not restrained him. Whereas it took Akainu 10 days to barely defeat
Aokiji
, Garp was able to easily overpower the latter in moments. During the raid on Hachinosu, he battled his former student, Kuzan, and the other Titanic Captains present there—
Sanjuan Wolf
,
Shiryu
,
Avalo Pizarro
, and
Vasco Shot
—all at once, while he initially held the upper-hand he was eventually overwhelmed after being stabbed through the abdomen by Shiryu to protect Koby. Despite this he held them off long enough to cover the Marines' escape.
Similarly, when it was revealed worldwide that Luffy is Garp's grandson, Luffy's fame rose based on that fact, as
Demaro Black
attempted to use that as one of the strong points in his impersonation of Luffy. Charlotte Linlin referenced Garp when Luffy challenged her. He has merits and influence great enough to make even the World Nobles do not dare to get rid of him despite his rebellious personality.
Jaygarcia Saturn
of the
Five Elders
remarked how Luffy's record is understandable, being Garp's grandson.
In addition, like his late rival, Gol D. Roger, Garp has never displayed any signs of being a Devil Fruit user, which makes everything he accomplished even more impressive.
Leadership
[
]
Garp is able to lead the elite members of
SWORD
against the waves of pirates on
Hachinosu
.
As a Vice Admiral of the
Marine Headquarters
, Garp has command over all lower ranking soldiers, as seen when he took two of
Ripper
's subordinates (Koby and Helmeppo) and made them his own subordinates instead due to his higher rank.
Also, as a Vice Admiral, he has the potential to be called upon to be one of five Vice Admirals leading a fleet of ten battleships during a
Buster Call
.
Being a Marine Vice Admiral and the commanding officer of the 153rd Marine Branch, Garp possesses leadership skills and is well respected by many among the Marines, having mentored many other prominent figures in the Marines, including former Admiral Kuzan.
Garp is also a great teacher, as he was able to make Koby and Helmeppo capable fighters in a short period of time, and he was also selected to be an instructor. He was also the one who trained Luffy and Ace into being strong enough to set sail on their own. After the Summit War of Marineford, Garp now trained the new recruits of young Marines. Kuzan, who was at the time as a cadet who already learned all he could from the official instructors, was able to become the powerful warrior he is today thanks to Garp's tutelage.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Garp is one of the strongest Marines, whose physical strength is considered legendary, having fought many powerful pirates including the Rock Pirates and Gol D. Roger himself in his prime. At his best he had monstrous punching power at his disposal, with his epithet,
"Garp the Fist"
, attesting to the immense power of his punches. He claimed to have crushed eight mountains during his training to face Chinjao. This is proven when he was able to dent Chinjao's drill head, which was powerful enough to split the immensely hard Ice Continent in two, with relative ease. In his youth and even all the way to old age, he would use retired
battleships
as punching bags, often doing so every day for years, without using Haki to build up punching power. As a result, he became capable of caving in the armored hulls of those ships with the strength of his fists alone.
It is evident
Whitebeard
respects Garp's strength, as he mentioned him during his talk with
Shanks
.
Even in old age, Garp still remains powerful, being able to launch iron cannonballs like baseballs at higher velocities than if they were fired from a real cannon, break through brick walls and cannon supports with his fists and carry and throw a giant iron ball and chain many times bigger than the Thousand Sunny. During the Summit War of Marineford, he struck down and injured a
Mythical Zoan
user like
Marco
with a single blow and, in the anime, Garp took down
Jesus Burgess
, a master fighter with titanic physical strength effortlessly. In conjunction with his tremendous mastery of Haki, Garp's strength becomes monstrous, as he was able to obliterate a portion of a town with a single blow, toss
Sanjuan Wolf
, a giant with the ability to
grow even more enormous
clean into the ocean and almost drowned him in the process, and decimate multiple structures and land masses connected to
Avalo Pizarro
and his
Devil Fruit
.
In addition to his immense physical strength, Garp also has tremendous levels of durability and tolerance to pain, as seen when his chest was deeply slashed by Captain
Morgan
's axe hand, only to recover mere seconds later, with no obvious pain and apparently oblivious to the fact that he was struck at all. In fact, when informed by one of the Marines that he was nearly killed, he mistook this for one of the men being killed. It was only when he saw what the wound did, he realized what happened, as he fell asleep before being attacked. He was able to get back on his feet after allowing himself to be punched by Luffy in
Gear 2
at point-blank range without losing consciousness and was still able to fight the
Blackbeard Pirates
along with
Sengoku
. On Hachinosu, Garp took numerous attacks from
Kuzan
, his former student who went through the same battleship punching training as Garp and came out with noticeably very little damage from his punches or his
ice-based
attacks. He was also run through with a sword by
Shiryu
, but not only did he shrug off the injury and attack Shiryu, but continued to fight a large number of the pirates on the island, including Kuzan and the rest of the Captains of the Blackbeard Pirates, holding them off long enough for the marines and the all the people rescued from the island to successfully escape.
Even after getting overwhelmed and Kuzan going for a killer blow, Garp still survived.
Garp is also extremely fast and agile, seemingly disappearing as soon as he starts moving. He managed to bypass all of the Straw Hats in order to get to a sleeping Luffy, with none of them even being able to react until he was already past them. He is also fast enough to grab Kuzan, a former Marine Admiral, by the face and slam him to the ground before he managed to defend himself. He was quick enough to grab two random pirates just to block a flaming attack from
Vasco Shot
, and even after being stabbed by Shiryu, was able to move around fast enough to bowl over Kuzan and travel across the island to land a devastating attack on Avalo Pizarro.
Techniques
[
]
Garp uses "Galaxy Impact", a powerful Supreme King Haki-infused attack.
Ai aru Kobushi
(
愛ある拳
?
, literally meaning "Fist of Love")
: A gag technique. It is a simple but powerful punch used to strike Luffy on his head. Garp had been shown to have used this on Ace during his childhood as well. In
Pirate Warriors 2
and
Pirate Warriors 3
, the game adds the visual effect of a giant fist coming down on the enemies and is Garp's first Special Attack in both games. In the Funimation adaptions, it is called
Fist of Love
.
Galaxy Impact
(
拳骨衝突
,
Gyarakushī Inpakuto
?
, literally meaning "Fist Collision")
: Garp infuses his fist with advanced
Armament Haki
and
Supreme King Haki
and then delivers a massively powerful shockwave punch that surrounds an enormous radius, devastating anything in its range. This attack was first seen used against the

on
Hachinosu
.
In the anime, the shockwave looks more like an enormous explosion; in addition, while charging the attack, Garp's fist generates a massive red flash of light.
Galaxy Divide
(
拳骨唐竹割
,
Gyarakushī Dibaido
?
, literally meaning "Fist Cleaving")

: An improvised technique Garp came up with after he used the bodies of defeated pirates to shield himself from
Vasco Shot
's
fire stream
. After the attack resulted in the pirates being engulfed in flames, Garp threw them in various directions causing damage to other pirates surrounding him.
In the VIZ manga, this is called
Pirate Fireballs
.
Rokushiki

Rokushiki
Garp is seemingly able to use
Soru
to move at great speed, being able to close the distance between himself and Kuzan in an instant.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
As a Vice Admiral of the Marines, Garp is fully capable of using Haki.
and is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki. He is also a capable teacher, as he taught Kuzan, Koby and Helmeppo.
Supreme King Haki
[
]
Garp possesses immense mastery in the usage of
Supreme King Haki
, a rare form of Haki that only one in several million people in the world can use.
Most notably, he is among the small "handful" of users who are capable of using the advanced application of "infusing" his Supreme King Haki into parts of his body or objects, as signified by the thin streams of black lightning emanating from his fist.
Garp can also use Supreme King Haki defensively, protecting himself from the deep-freezing effects of Kuzan's
Ice Ball
before easily breaking out of it.
Garp displayed advanced application at multiple points, notably during his fight with Kuzan, grabbing him by the face and sending him downward creating a large hole with a powerful Supreme King attack, and once more on
Avalo Pizarro
, delivering a powerful Supreme King shockwave punch that left a vertical injury on the pirate.
Armament Haki
[
]
Garp uses Armament Haki to flatten Chinjao's head.
Garp is an immensely skilled and powerful master of
Armament Haki
. By hardening his fist, Garp became able to counter and even crush
Chinjao
's Armament Haki-enhanced drill-shaped head 30 years ago, proving his superior mastery compared to Chinjao, who himself is a masterful Armament Haki user in his own right.
During the
Summit War of Marineford
, he managed to punch and hurt
Marco
, despite the latter being in his regenerative phoenix form.
He can also utilize the advanced application of emitting Armament Haki out from his hands, allowing him to attack opponents without making physical contact.
Observation Haki
[
]
Garp is an extremely skilled and experienced user of
Observation Haki
.
He could sense that Kuzan was present on
Hachinosu
and was going to freeze
Hibari
where other Observation Haki users (including herself,
Tashigi
and the rest of
SWORD
) could not sense him.
He was able to sense and catch Shiryu's attack when he attempted to attack a distracted Koby, despite the former jailer being
invisible
.
When Koby awakened Observation Haki, Dr.
Fishbonen
recommended that he ask Garp how to master it, suggesting Garp has enough expertise in it to mentor others.
Weapons

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Before the Great Age of Pirates
[
]
Monkey D. Garp was born 78 years ago in the
Goa Kingdom
in the
East Blue
.
He joined the
Marines
56 years ago at the age of 22 along with
Tsuru
and
Sengoku
.
At 23, Garp started a family with an unknown woman and had a son named
Monkey D. Dragon
.
Over the years, Garp would rise up through the ranks of the Marines, eventually achieving the rank of
Vice Admiral
.
Marine forces, led by Garp, arrive at God Valley.
38 years ago,
Kong
alerted Garp, who was on vacation, of an incident on
God Valley
involving the
World Nobles
and the
Rocks Pirates
. Initially Garp brushed it off as the
God's Knights
and other Marines were already on the island for their protection until Kong told him that the
Roger Pirates
were also there. This revelation caused Garp to immediately take the threat seriously and head over to God Valley, bringing along
Bogard
and a few more Marines with him to confront
Gol D. Roger
.
This event would later be labeled as the
God Valley Incident
, where Garp would earn his epithet of "Hero of the Marines" after successfully defeating
Rocks D. Xebec
at God Valley and protecting the Nobles through joint forces with Roger, the latter a detail that was not publicly reported due to
Morgans
covering only Garp's heroism. Garp rarely discusses the God Valley Incident as he feels shame about this event.
Around this time, Garp also chased other pirates like
Shakuyaku
as part of his duties.
At some point, Garp was approached by
Kuzan
, who had already surpassed the standard Marine training and was ready for the next level, so he asked Garp to take him on as an apprentice. Garp initially refused, but eventually, through unknown events Garp did indeed end up training Kuzan. They trained using "punching ships", the same thing as punching bags, only they trained by punching the bow of scraped ships, leaving large indents in the ships they practiced on. As a rule of the training, they were not allowed to use Haki or Devil Fruit powers, just raw brute strength. During this training, Garp became more casual with Kuzan even talking to him about his
son
.
Thirty years ago, he fought
Chinjao
and got his epithet as "Garp the Fist"
and also earned his hatred after denting his pointy head, which was the strongest head of that time, and robbing him of the means to acquire the treasure from the Ice Continent.
He became famous for cornering and fighting the late Pirate King,
Gol D. Roger
, numerous times in his career. Garp was offered a promotion to admiral position many times from Fleet Admiral Kong, but he declined every time. The main reason was because he refused to work under authority of the Celestial Dragons, according to Sengoku's statement.
Three years before Roger's execution, Garp hears about the Roger Pirates and the
Golden Lion Pirates
confrontation at
Edd War
. He then walks out on the then
Fleet Admiral
,
Kong
's office, and was accompanied by Tsuru,
Jaguar D. Saul
,
Sakazuki
and Kuzan who remarked that he rejected another promotion with Garp rebuffing it and asked Tsuru to give her ship to him. He then forces his way onto
Admiral
Sengoku
's ship, much to Sengoku's annoyance.
Roger asking Garp to protect his child.
Prior to Roger's execution, the Pirate King requested Garp to take care of his then-unborn child, as he thought the child did not deserve to be branded a criminal due to being born to a pirate.
When
Shiki the Golden Lion
attacked
Marineford
a week before Roger's execution, Garp and Sengoku challenged him together. After a grueling battle that devastated half of Marineford, they managed to defeat him. A number of months after the Pirate King's death, Garp went to
Baterilla
and visited
Portgas D. Rouge
. He was present at Ace's birth and Rouge's death afterward. Honoring Roger's last request, Garp took Ace to
Dawn Island
to be raised by
Dadan
. Garp would visit Ace during his vacations. Seventeen years prior to the start of the story, Garp became a grandfather to a newly born
Monkey D. Luffy
after his
son
had left him in his care.
The Three Brothers
[
]
Garp sending Luffy to live with Dadan.
Early on in Luffy's life, Garp trained him to become a strong Marine. Luffy was thrown into valleys, left alone in dangerous forests, and tied to balloons over high altitudes, all for the sake of making him stronger. After this, he left Luffy in the care of Dadan.
Despite Dadan not wanting to take care of another one of Garp's children, she complied. When Dadan voiced her displeasure of Garp's irresponsibility to take care of them himself, he became angered, making Dadan immediately take back what she said.
Throughout his visits, he would often hold "training sessions" with Luffy and Ace and on one occasion with
Sabo
.
When Garp first read in the
newspaper
that Ace had become the captain of the
Spade Pirates
, he was furious.
Diary of Koby-Meppo
[
]
Garp was first introduced as the Marine Officer in charge of escorting Captain
Morgan
.
However, after Garp fell asleep, Morgan made his escape by striking Garp and taking
Helmeppo
as a hostage, fleeing on a small boat. Garp then woke up unfazed and broke a cannon while waking up.
After Koby returned with Helmeppo, they offered themselves to be punished, but Garp decided to take charge of the pair. He took them back to
Marine Headquarters
and oversaw their training.
During a class, Garp asked the recruits what they would do if they were riding in a boat and could only bring either a baby or an old man onboard. When Koby answered that he would let both of them ride in the boat instead of himself, Garp threw a marker at him and told him that answer was wrong, explaining that the baby should be saved because the old man would not have much time left to live. He added that the most important thing that the Marines should be trying to protect is the future of the people, meaning that the survival of babies and young people like Koby are more important than that of an old man.
Hototogisu
later hit Garp over the head with a bat and scolded him for his lecture, explaining that all lives mattered, but Garp insisted that the future of the young people was limitless.
When Garp questioned Helmeppo about Koby's bandaged hands, Helmeppo explained that every night after their training with Garp, Koby would practice punching battleship bags to further hone his strength.

Water 7 Saga
[
]
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
After arriving at
Water 7
, he went to the small house where Luffy was recuperating from his battles at
Enies Lobby
. Vice Admiral Garp marched to the front of the temporary
Galley-La Headquarters
and told two subordinates in specific to wait outside. Garp broke through the wall and into the Straw Hats' room. He asked if they were the Straw Hats as everyone prepared to fight, but before they could do anything, Garp passed them and punched a sleeping Luffy's head into the floor, telling him to wake up. To everyone's surprise, Luffy screamed in pain. Garp then said that no one can escape his Fist of Love. He then removed his mask and told Luffy he heard he had been doing reckless things. Luffy was shocked to see that the man behind the mask was none other than his grandfather, and everyone else were even more surprised that Luffy's grandfather is a high-ranking Marine.
Garp said Luffy owed him an apology as he was causing trouble. Luffy told the others not to fight with his grandfather, as Garp had nearly killed him on many occasions in his childhood. Garp snapped at Luffy for making him sound like a bad guy for what he did in the past and claimed those incidents were aimed at turning Luffy into a strong man.
Garp reminded Luffy that he wanted him to be a strong Marine, which Luffy countered by claiming he had always told him he wanted to be a pirate. Garp responded by saying that Luffy was negatively influenced by Shanks, to which Luffy took offense because Shanks saved his life. Garp suddenly grabbed Luffy, asking if he was trying to tell his grandpa what to do. Luffy's crew panicked over what to do until they found the pair have fallen asleep. Garp, being the first of the two to wake up, punched Luffy awake for falling asleep on him, while the others pointed out Garp did the same. Garp then ordered his men to repair the wall he damaged. The men said that Garp should help repair the wall as he destroyed it. Garp explained he did so because he thought it would look cool.
As Garp repaired the wall, he said he heard that Luffy met his father at
Loguetown
. Luffy did not have a clue about it and was clueless of even having a father in the first place. Garp then announced that Luffy's father is the revolutionary
Monkey D. Dragon
, causing a sudden shock amongst all those around him. After Robin explained to Luffy about Dragon, the
Revolutionary Army
, and their goals, Garp turned around and said that he should not have said that, asking them to forget he said anything, causing even more shock amongst everyone.
Garp told Luffy that he would let him go since he is his grandson and would use that as an excuse when informing his superior officers. However, his advisor
Bogard
told Garp it would be better to lie and say the Straw Hats got away. Garp then said that he mostly came for his students and announced his departure. Luffy said goodbye and Garp punched him, saying he was letting him leave too easily and berated him for being too casual about saying goodbye to his grandfather whom he had not seen in a while. Luffy complained by saying the only thing Garp has ever done was hit him to which Garp replied he just wanted to show love to and be loved by his grandson.
Some days later, Fleet Admiral
Sengoku
ordered Garp to return to Water 7 to capture Luffy. Garp's ship picked up
Aokiji
along the way, but only because he did not want to ride his bicycle. After returning to Water 7, Garp announced to Luffy that he was going to die there. Luffy argued that he said he would not attack, but Garp simply said he got his orders and proceeded to attack by throwing a cannonball at breakneck speed at them. The Straw Hats were amazed but prepared to defend the ship and started to set sail. Garp then asked for one thousand cannonballs, intending to throw them all at them. Garp began to get flustered and threw another cannonball, but Luffy knocked it out of the way. Luffy said he really had to run and hoped they would see each other again sometime.
Garp then took out an enormous iron ball and tossed it at the
Thousand Sunny
. Before it could crush the Thousand Sunny,
Franky
activated Coup de Burst to launch the ship up into the sky. The Straw Hats got away, but Garp just laughed.

Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
After his grandson's assault on
Thriller Bark
, he was seen at
Mary Geoise
with
Bartholomew Kuma
and
Sengoku
, where he laughed at how Luffy had avoided capture by Kuma and annoyed Sengoku by talking about tea and crackers.
Recently, Garp found out that
Silvers Rayleigh
was to be sold as a
slave
on the
Sabaody Archipelago
, whom he assumed let himself get captured to pay off a gambling debt. Due to the Marines being busy with the incident regarding
Whitebeard
and the execution of
Portgas D. Ace
, Garp remarked that he would take care of the situation.
Impel Down Arc
[
]
Sengoku blaming Garp for Luffy's actions in
Impel Down
.
He later visited Ace in Impel Down. Upon Ace's request to die, Garp merely told him that his death would not stop Whitebeard. They later discussed family issues such as Ace and Luffy's turning to the life of piracy instead of becoming Marines. Ace also told Garp that he only considered Whitebeard as his true father.
Back at
Marineford
, Garp was informed that Luffy broke into Impel Down and was rather amused about it, even proud.
Sengoku
was furious and said that if Garp was not a hero to the Marines, he would have him punished for his family's actions. Garp just laughed and stated that an old man's life could not atone for his family's actions.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Three hours before
Ace
was to be executed, Garp walked with
Sengoku
to the execution platform. Sengoku told him that he would tell the public everything and Garp did not express any objections. As Sengoku began his public announcement on the execution platform,
Tsuru
told Garp that it was not his fault. Garp just laughed and said that women get so sentimental at times like these. Once Sengoku revealed that Ace was truly the son of
Gol D. Roger
, Garp remembered the time when Roger personally begged him to protect his unborn child.
Garp grieving about how Ace ended up.
After the war began, Garp sat with Ace and Sengoku on top of the execution platform, upset at the present events. He stated that while he felt no sorrow for scoundrels, he felt differently when it came to Ace, who was family. Garp bitterly lamented that both Ace and
Luffy
did not become Marines.
Upon Luffy's arrival at Marineford, Garp was utterly shocked. Nevertheless, he managed to calm down long enough to comment on the viability of the motley little band that Luffy had assembled at Impel Down as part of Ace's rescue effort. Later, when Sengoku revealed Luffy's status as the son of Dragon the Revolutionary, Garp stated that with the infamy and power Luffy had acquired, such knowledge being brought to the general public hardly made a difference.
Garp punching Marco in his phoenix form.
After Luffy was hurled over the siege wall and stood before the three admirals, Garp was shown to be worried about his grandson. He was later seen with Sengoku, getting ready to participate in the battle. Garp later punched
Marco
, who had transformed into his
Phoenix form
, while he was trying to save Ace. Garp then challenged the
Whitebeard Pirates
, saying that they would have to kill him before they could reach Ace.
When Luffy released a massive burst of
Supreme King Haki
, Garp said he knew his grandson had that kind of power inside him.
When Luffy came close to reaching Ace, thanks to
Inazuma
's
powers
, Garp himself confronted him. He smashed part of the bridge in the process, saying that he could not let Luffy pass. He again complained about Luffy and Ace becoming pirates instead of Marines and declared that he considered them enemies.
As he was about to hit Luffy, he recalled Ace's renewed desire to live and reminisced about when Ace and Luffy were both young. Finding himself unwilling to resist, Garp closed his eyes, missing his punch. Thus, he allowed Luffy to land a Gear 2 punch that sent him flying and smashing into the ground, much to the shock of the Marines watching him.
Garp later dislodged himself, more or less unfazed, and rejoined the battle. After witnessing Ace being pierced from behind by Akainu's
magma fist
, Garp flew into a rage, prompting Sengoku to stop him, grabbing his head from behind and slamming him to the ground. Coughing up blood, Garp snarled that Sengoku should keep him down tight or he would murder Sakazuki. Sengoku responded by calling Garp a fool. When Ace died, Garp wept over the loss of his grandson.
Garp and Sengoku battling Blackbeard.
When Whitebeard began attacking Marineford Headquarters after the death of Ace, Garp commented that Newgate was putting an end to this era, which he welcomed. As Whitebeard lost his life at the hands of the
Blackbeard Pirates
, Garp watched with a grim expression. After acquiring the
Gura Gura no Mi
from Whitebeard's corpse, Blackbeard commented to both Garp and Sengoku that their age was over, much like Whitebeard's.
Later, he heard someone yelling to everyone. He saw Koby standing in front of Admiral Akainu, calling for an end to the war. Upon seeing Shanks making an appearance at Marineford, Garp made a snarling comment about the pirate who influenced Luffy into the path of piracy. When Sengoku announced that the war was over, Garp stood down along with the rest of the Marines.

With the end of the war, Garp took up a station in
Foosha Village
on
Dawn Island

Curly Dadan
for letting Ace die until
Makino
intervened. Makino tried to tell Dadan that Garp was suffering the most from Ace's death, but Dadan replied that the one suffering the most was Luffy. After Dadan calmed down, Garp informed

that Luffy escaped Marineford in a
submarine
.
It was later revealed that both him and Sengoku stepped down from the Marines. However, both would remain for the sake of rearing up new young Marines.

Final Saga

Egghead Arc
[
]
Weeks later, Koby was reported to have been abducted by the
Blackbeard Pirates
, so Garp sailed to
G-14
before heading to
Hachinosu
. Vice Admiral
Doll
tried to dissuade Garp from taking Helmeppo and starting a fight with an Emperor, but Garp ignored her protests and yelled for Helmeppo to join him in rescuing Koby.
Having recruited members of
SWORD
and
Tashigi
for his mission, the
Marines
departed to Hachinosu. Upon SWORD beginning their attack on the island and Garp's ship approaching it, the ship was launched from the sea to above the island. Telling the pirates how important Koby is to the future of the Marines and himself, he infused his fist in
Supreme King Haki
and attacked the island with
Galaxy Impact
and decimated the surrounding area.
Garp slams Kuzan into the ground.
Garp then landed safely and stated he was disappointed that he had lost his touch with his attack, much to the shock and surprise of the Blackbeard Pirates. Garp was then confronted by
Kuzan
, who froze
Hibari
and stated he would not let Koby escape. Garp then demanded that Kuzan unfreeze Hibari, set Koby free, and return to the Marines, but Kuzan rejected his demands, stating he always loved that Garp did what he wanted. Kuzan then froze Garp with
Ice Ball
, asking Garp if he could kill his old protégé to protect his new one, but Garp only replied he had told Kuzan that he should live in the moment and that wavering would be a sign of weakness. He then imbued his hand with Armament and Supreme King Haki and grabbed Kuzan mid-air, slamming him into the ground below with
Blue Hole
.
Garp defeated and surrounded by the Blackbeard Pirates.
Garp threw
Sanjuan Wolf
into the sea, which caused the Blackbeard Pirates to rush in to save him from drowning.
Vasco Shot
then tried
burning
Garp, but the old man merely used random pirates as human shields.
Shiryu
attempted to stab Koby while he was
invisible
, but Garp stepped in front of him and took the attack instead. Kuzan then returned and resumed battling.
As
Avalo Pizarro
was about to crush Garp's ship and all the marines and escaped slaves on it with his
massive hand of rock and soil
, Garp ordered Koby, Helmeppo, and Grus to deal with the hand while he attacked the giant stone skull, delivering serious damage to Pizarro. As Koby and the rest of SWORD successfully escaped the island, Garp was pierced though the chest again, this time by Kuzan's ice. Garp smiled as he told everyone via the
Den Den Mushi
to never forget they were the future of the Marines as Wolf, Shiryu, Pizarro, Shot and Kuzan closed in on him. Garp then started laughing and the transmission ended.

Adaptation Differences

Anime Differences
[
]
In the anime, the Marines accompanying Garp identified him, not Nami immediately and she only calls him that after hearing his name.
In the anime, Garp attacks
Jesus Burgess
when he moves to strike Sengoku while he is distracted. After the war ended, he orders the soldiers to gather the wounded so no one else would die.
Garp about to punish (or in this case, train) Luffy and Ace.
In the anime, a young Luffy blurted out that the trio shared a promise over a shared drink. Garp overheard them boasting of their dreams to become pirates, leaving him infuriated. Garp then chases them out into the night, breaking down trees and rocks and beating them all to a pulp. Sabo exclaimed he was a monster. Afterwards, he casually leaves them, saying that he will not be so merciful next time. This was not shown in the manga. In the manga version, Garp was shown saying hello first before "training" them.
Live-Action Differences
[
]
In the live-action series, Garp's role in the story is changed drastically from the manga. Garp's relationship to Luffy is made clear much earlier than the manga, with Zoro, Nami, and Usopp learning that he is Luffy's grandfather as early as their first sail on the
Going Merry
. Garp chases the Straw Hat Pirates across the East Blue, from Shells Town to Cocomi Islands, instead of meeting them after the events at Enies Lobby. Garp is also much more dedicated to capturing Luffy and ending his pirate career before it begins.
When Garp's ship intercepts the Going Merry, Luffy manages to deter the Marines by bouncing one of their cannon balls back at their mast as the Straw Hats escape through a fog.
After the Straw Hats arrive at the Baratie, Garp enlists the help of Dracula Mihawk to bring Luffy in alive. When Mihawk refuses to, even with the threat of revoking his status as Warlord, Garp is irate. He later talks to Koby about the Warlords and expresses his disdain for the World Government's decisions and why he remains a Vice-Admiral.
Garp arrives at the
Baratie
to ask
Zeff
about Luffy's whereabouts. Garp confesses to Zeff why he is insistent on capturing Luffy.
As Straw Hats celebrate their victory over
Arlong
and his
crew
, Garp and the Marines arrive at Coco Village. Garp plans to bring the Straw Hats in, but Luffy refuses to yield. Garp and Luffy fight, with the former dominating the battle. After seeing Roger's own determination and spirit in him, Garp changes his mind on arresting Luffy and instead orders his Marines to hunt the stragglers of Arlong's crew. He later receives his grandson's first bounty, impressed by how far he has come.

Early Concepts
[
]
Luffy's grandfather from
Romance Dawn V.2.
Luffy's grandfather in the
Romance Dawn
anime special.
While unnamed, Garp was introduced in
Romance Dawn, Version 2
(featured in
Weekly Shonen Jump
magazine
itself) as
Luffy
's grandfather. For a long time, it was first thought that Luffy's unnamed Grandfather was a sole addition to Romance Dawn V.2.
Some aspects of his character remain from
Romance Dawn V.2
. He is as hot tempered as ever and intolerant of Luffy's antics. Like the final version, he was determined to make Luffy follow in his footsteps, however here he is a pirate captain, the complete opposite of his current occupation. Both stories have in return Luffy completely rejecting the idea of following in his grandfather's footsteps. Garp now occasionally wears a dog hat and compared to his chubby
Romance Dawn V.2
version, his upper body is much more muscular.
One feature carried over from Luffy's grandfather from
V.2
to the final version of Garp was the scar on his left eye. Also, Luffy got both his hat and the Devil fruit he ate from his grandfather in
V.2
, not Shanks. According to Oda the reason for not featuring Shanks was that he wanted Shanks to be kept a secret until
One Piece
was serialized so he would have a greater impact.
When
V.2
was adapted into
Episode 907
of the anime as a celebration of the series' 20th anniversary, he had Garp's muscular physique instead of the chubby appearance he had in the manga. He also had Garp's voice actors.
