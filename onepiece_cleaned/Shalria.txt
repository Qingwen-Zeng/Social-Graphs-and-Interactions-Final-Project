Saint Shalria
is a
World Noble
, the younger sister of Saint
Charlos
, and the daughter of Saint
Rosward
.
Alongside the rest of her family, Shalria is one of the main antagonists of the
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Like other World Nobles she is dressed in a thick white suit with medal-like knobs which supplies her with oxygen to save her sharing the same air as commoners. The collar of her suit has a flower like pattern with lace at the top. The flower pattern on her suit repeats at the sides of her skirt. Her dirty blonde hair inside the bubble is styled upwards, forming a curl above her head. She wears a veil over the lower half of her face and light orange tinted shades over her eyes. She also wears heart-shaped earrings.
Personality
[
]
Like her fellow Celestial Dragons, she shows no concern for those whose statuses are beneath her and shows no pity, remorse, or regret about how she treats her slaves. In an incident where she lost her slave, she coldly commented on how her father would simply have to buy her another, viewing the slave's demise in such a lowly way she mocked him as barely being a human. She detests the weak more than anything (which is rather ironic considering she has no fighting skill of her own).
She also has great pride in her family's ancestry, as she swore to make the Straw Hats suffer a living hell upon capture for what they did to her father and brother.
While na√Øve to the length that
Luffy
and the other pirates would do everything to achieve their goals, she was not incapable of realizing their ultimate goal. Out of her family, she was the only one who went straight to the target of their rescue and attempted to murder
Camie
, even if it was just a display of her cruel mentality. She was also not above racism, referring to Camie as a "fish". She also did not honor transactions, as she went to kill Camie without paying
Disco
the
500,000,000 that her brother bid for the mermaid beforehand.
Unlike the more senior Celestial Dragons, Shalria did not understand the importance of the
Void Century
, and was confused at why her elder compatriots were so worked up when
Dr. Vegapunk
was broadcasting it worldwide.
She has a strange habit of ending her sentences with "amasu" or just "su".

Summit War Saga
[

Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
When her
slave
Devil Dias
escaped in the
Sabaody Archipelago
, her father,
Rosward
, commented on her carelessness in ruining his captain collection. After Dias' collar exploded, Shalria mocked his pitifulness, shot him, and then casually walked away, commenting on how next time she wants a
giant
as a slave.
She and her father later visited the
Human Auctioning House
. She noted that her brother, Saint
Charlos
, was running late.
She was delighted when her brother finally arrived before the end of the auction. After Charlos won the bid on the
mermaid
Camie
, the
Straw Hat Pirates
disrupted the event and
Monkey D. Luffy
punched Charlos.
After
Usopp
crashed into her father, Shalria took
Disco
's gun and attempted to kill Camie, but
Silvers Rayleigh
knocked her out with a burst of
Haki
before she could fire.
After waking up, Shalria stood outside of the auction house with her beaten and unconscious father and brother and angrily shouted insults at the Marines for not capturing the Straw Hats yet. In her anger, she swore that upon their capture, she would force the pirate crew to beg on the ground for forgiveness and then bring hell to them.
