Whole Cake Island Arc
[

Citron attended the
Tea Party
and
wedding
of
Sanji
and
Charlotte Pudding
, in which she took part in
her mother
's plan to assassinate the
Vinsmoke Family
. She socialized with some of the other attendees before Sanji and Pudding arrived to the venue.
After
Monkey D. Luffy
and the rest of the
Straw Hat Pirates
crashed the event, she witnessed with her sister
Cinnamon
as
Jinbe
broke ties with the
Big Mom Pirates
.
After the Straw Hats and
Fire Tank Pirates
' assassination attempt failed, Citron watched as
Capone Bege
used
Big Father
in order to protect the alliance.
She attacked
Pedro
along with her older brother
Opera.
She accompanied her sisters on
Smoothie
's ship as they chased the
Thousand Sunny
on the seas of
Totto Land
.
Smoothie's fleet continued pursuit of the Thousand Sunny while
Perospero
and
Bavarois
's fleet split off to follow Big Mom and the
Nostra Castello
.
When Smoothie increased her size to attack the Sunny, Citron warned that she would sink her own ship if she grew any bigger.
When the Smoothie's fleet reached
Cacao Island
, they focused on pursuing the Straw Hats instead of fighting the
Germa 66
fleet that had arrived.
The
Sun Pirates
also appeared and stopped Smoothie's ship from moving.
The combined forces of the Germa 66 and Sun Pirates held off Big Mom's fleet long enough for the Sunny to escape.
