Benn Beckman
is the
first mate
of the
Red Hair Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Beckman is a tall man, standing at a height of 206cm.
Twelve years ago, in
Foosha Village
, his hair was long, light brown (black in the anime) and pulled back in a ponytail.
In the current storyline, his hair is now gray, medium-length, and slicked-back. He also now has a large, X-shaped scar on his left temple.
He is never seen without his rifle nearby or a cigarette in his mouth.
His outfit has changed very little over the years since his first appearance; he now wears a black, v-neck shirt with three quarter sleeves (whereas he is previously seen wearing a short-sleeved shirt of a similar color and design) along with loose pants (originally of a dark green color, but presently gray) with numerous pockets on them, tucked inside his buckled boots. Like most of the other Red Hair Pirates, he wears a sash around his waist, to which he attaches his rifle in a pistol-like fashion. The only thing added to his attire is his spiral-patterned cloak.
Personality
[
]
Beckman appears to be a lot less fun-loving and a lot more relaxed than the other members of the crew are, acting as the level-headed member. He,
Lucky Roux
, and
Yasopp
are some of
Shanks
' most trusted crew members, as they are always seen when the Red Hair Pirates are featured, usually when something crucial happens.
He is a well-deserved vice-captain who silently supports the crew with a deep attitude despite their liveliness.
At times, Beckman seems amused at the actions of his captain, such as panicking when
Luffy
is taken
or getting even more drunk when he has already drunk a lot before and when
Dracule Mihawk
brought the news of Luffy's first bounty.
He is the first to speak out among the crew whenever they appear. He also seems to be the first to ask questions about the crew's situation, such as whether the
World Government
would try to stop them from seeing
Whitebeard
.
He is a playboy and loves women.
Relationships
[
]
Red Hair Pirates
[
]
As the first mate of the Red Hair Pirates, He holds the most trust and highest authority behind their
Chief
himself.
Shanks
[
]
As the right-hand man of Shanks, he is the man Shanks trusts the most. Beckman has a keen understanding of how Shanks operates, telling Luffy about the responsibilities Shanks has to face every day as a pirate captain. On the other hand, he can still end up amazed by some of the more foolish actions from his captain, such as panicking when Luffy was taken by Higuma. or getting even drunker while already hungover after Mihawk brought news of Luffy's new bounty.
He is one of the three members of the crew who always appear with Shanks.
Friends
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Like the rest of the crew Beckman also befriended
Luffy
after their arrival at Foosha Village. Just like his
Captain
, he had a lot of faith in Luffy becoming a great pirate. When Luffy declared his goal to Shanks and the rest of the crew, Beckman commented to his captain that Luffy will make it big someday which later came true, as Luffy is now considered to be one of the
Four Emperors
, like his captain. Luffy holds Beckman in high regards and like the rest of the crew he was appreciative of them saving him from
Higuma
and his crew of bandits.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the first mate of the Red Hair Pirates,
Beckman is the crew's second highest authority behind Shanks himself. He holds a great deal of experience as the eldest of the crew's core members.
As a combatant, Beckman is very powerful
with superb combat effectiveness and agility.
At the end of the
Summit War of Marineford
,
Admiral
Kizaru
chose not to engage with Beckman when the latter had him held at gunpoint, even though Kizaru had fought
Marco
earlier and even
Whitebeard
himself.
Intelligence
[
]
Beckman is especially known for his advanced intellect, having the highest IQ of any character introduced during the
East Blue Saga
(above the master strategist
Kuro
's and
Nami
's).
Stealth
[
]
Beckman has demonstrated some stealth ability when the Red Hair Pirates arrived at
Marineford
to stop the war, able to climb up and sit on a Marine ship's mast to point his flintlock at nearby Kizaru, a
Observation Haki
user, without the latter noticing until Beckman made his presence known.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Beckman possesses impressive physical strength. Twelve years ago, he easily defeated
Higuma
's crew of
mountain bandits
using only a cigarette and his rifle as a club.
Beckman is also extremely fast, as shown when he climbed up and sat on a Marine ship's mast to intercept Kizaru before he could attack the
Polar Tang
, despite having just arrived at the scene.
Another showing of his strength is when he managed to take the arm clean off of the
Worst Generation
pirate
Eustass Kid
.
Haki
[
]
Main article:

Beckman is a skilled user of
Armament Haki
.
He is able to imbue his rifle's bullets with this type of Haki, allowing him to hold a
Logia
-type
Devil Fruit
user like Kizaru at gunpoint.
Non-canonically, in
One Piece Film: Red
, Beckman hardened his hands to stop bullets from hitting civilians.
Weapons
[
]
Beckman carries a
flintlock
rifle with him, but he has yet to be seen firing it, instead having used it as a club on Higuma's men twelve years ago,
and as a threat against Kizaru.

Romance Dawn
[
]
The Red Hair Pirates in Foosha Village.
Sometime later the crew settled in
Foosha Village
, here he met
Monkey D. Luffy
, who was always asking to join the crew.
A year later, he saw the boy climb onto the figurehead and stab himself with a dagger under the eye to prove his bravery. With the rest of the crew, he arrived at
Partys Bar
where he toasted Luffy and his journey. Beckman tried to explain
Shanks
' decision on refusing to take Monkey D. Luffy with him to sea. Unfortunately, he found that his captain left him in somewhat of an awkward situation, since he seemed to enjoy mocking the fact that Luffy could not swim, leaving Beckman to explain that Shanks really was not that happy all the time. He then overheard the conversation between Shanks and Higuma, after which the latter ordered his subordinates to attack them. Benn Beckman thus told his captain to leave them to him, arguing that alone would be enough. He then stubbed out a cigarette on one enemy's forehead, and took out the rest with his rifle very easily. He then pointed the gun at Higuma arguing that if they were going to fight them, they should have gotten a warship.
When they were about to leave the island, he heard Luffy's announcement of being a great pirate, and when his captain passed by, he told him that Luffy would become great. The crew then set sail.
The Spade Pirates
[
]
Two years before the start of the story, the
Spade Pirates
broke into the cave where the Red Hair Pirates were partying, but none of them were surprised by the sudden visit.
Ace
introduced himself to Shanks, telling him where he was born and raised, citing Makino and his teachings on good manners. Hearing that name, the Emperor's crew members began to pay more attention and accepted Ace's gift, which was a bottle of liquor. The young pirate told Shanks that Luffy was his brother, which shocked the Emperor's crew. He listened to the captain's conversation with him and Ace about Luffy, as well as Ace's plans to defeat the pirates and the Celestial Dragons.
As the Spade Pirates left, Beckman and Shanks commented on Ace's
Haki
and how the snow around him had stopped and returned when he left. Shanks then asked him what he thought of Ace, and he replied that he was naiver than he seemed, and should have joined the Revolutionary Army if his goal was to collapse the world, adding that with that step he would never become the captain of a fleet of boats, in addition to commenting on their reward. However, Shanks replied that Ace said that he was born in Baterilla and smiled. Beckman looked at the captain from him and thought that he was smiling a little differently than usual.

Later, the crew arrived at
Elbaph
, where they spent some time in a bar. Suddenly,
Rockstar
informed Shanks that the
Kid Pirates
are attacking them. Beckman points out that the crew would be furious towards them.
Lucky Roux
tells him that he should already know why they hold such a grudge against him specifically.
Shanks gives the order to set sail to fight in the sea so as not to risk damaging the island, where he asks
Dorry
and
Brogy
if they will lend him a hand, to which the giants accept. Beckman also listens to the message that Shanks tells Rockstar. When they were heading to their ship, they were welcomed by their subordinate captains, where one of them tells them that they wanted to pay tribute, to which Beckman tells him that they don't use that kind of system.
The crew boarded the ship, preparing to fight. As

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga when he encounters Kizaru during
Marineford
and tells him to not attack
Law
's
Submarine
, Kizaru blithely ignored the direct threat and went ahead with his attack by assaulting the bay with several beams of light. In the manga, Beckman reacts to this while his reaction was removed in the anime.
