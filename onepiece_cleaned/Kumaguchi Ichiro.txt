The subject of this article is sometimes called
Beli
,
Beri
, or
Berry
.
The
Belly
,
commonly represented as
(a
Latin lowercase
esh
superimposed over a capital
B
), is the
world
's main monetary unit.
Overview
[
]
Belly are currently known to exist in six coin denominations and three paper denominations, with no further fractional units. These denominations are as follows:
Coin:
1,
5,
10,
50,
100, and
500
Paper:
1,000,
5,000, and
10,000
Each of the paper denominations depicts a different personage:
Usaguchi Hideo
(
ウサグチヒデヨ
?
)
on the
1,000 note,
Kumaguchi Ichiro
(
クマグチイチロー
?
)
on the
5,000 note, and
Gaikotsu Yukichi
(
ガイコツユキチ
?
)
on the
10,000 note.
It is unknown if these are actual individuals or fictitious icons.
Belly denominations and designs, as explained by the
Volume 53 SBS
.
Belly is apparently payable in
check
form, indicating reliable institutional backing.
Per the written bounty on
Dorry
and
Brogy
's joint
wanted poster
, it has existed in circulation for over one hundred years.
Distribution
[
]
When Oda discussed the
Doskoi Panda
brand, he mentioned that the line was very expensive. With this in mind, to properly put the currency's value in a real-world context, a
10,000 shirt is expensive to the people of the One Piece world.
Bell-mère
was noted to be too poor to give her daughters everything they needed in life, and when
Arlong
invaded she had only a life's savings totaling at the time just
100,000 and had prior to this often been on a diet of just oranges to pay for the life she had to offer her daughters. She was the only one in her village unable to pay the full amount Arlong requested at the time of his arrival (
100,000 per adult,
50,000 per child), and Arlong continued to demand this amount regularly from the residents of
Cocoyasi Village
resulting in years of struggle to pay the amount to avoid anyone being killed by Arlong. Arlong had agreed with
Nami
that she only had to bring
100,000,000 to buy her village back off him, an amount she took 8 years to amass and almost succeeded in reaching the goal simply by robbing pirates knowing they had access to more wealth than citizens. Notably, also, Nami once demanded
1,000,000,000 from
Igaram
to protect his country's princess calling it a "measly" sum for a royal household to have, but later it was noted that the country did not even have this amount of wealth to offer as it was on the verge of civil war.
The
Straw Hat Pirates
considered themselves "wealthy" after gaining gold worth
300,000,000. When they lost
200,000,000 of it to the
Franky Family
they noted their remaining
100,000,000 was still enough to buy a decent second-hand ship to continue their journey, even though their original amount would have bought them a brand new ship of much better quality (though Franky later used that very stolen
200,000,000 to build the crew
a ship
of great quality). The most affordable slaves are humans at
500,000 while
70,000,000 for a female unsplit mermaid is the highest starting bid for any race.
As such, all kidnapping groups seek them out and they present the most profitable slaves at auctions, and the storyline hints they can run well into the
100,000,000s, being noted only to be bought by only the wealthiest of the One Piece world inhabitants.
Rare
Adam Wood
, being sold on the black market can reach the price of about
200,000,000.
However, to a
World Noble
, a bid of
500,000,000 seems to be an insignificant amount of money to them judging by the way Saint
Charlos
bid in the
Human Auctioning House
. And most noteworthy, he bid this amount off the mark and no one else could counter it, ending the sale of
Camie
then and there.
His father
merely noted this as a 'waste of money', implying they have even more wealth and do not go through the same scale of financial concerns as the rest of the world. Their income appears to be the result of taxes that kingdoms affiliated with the
World Government
are required to pay, collectively known as the
Heavenly Tribute
. Depending on the wealth of a nation, paying those tributes can range from trivial to nearly impossible, with poorer countries possibly suffering of famine as a result.
While the limit of
bounties
is unknown, the highest known bounty belongs to
Gol D. Roger
, whose total bounty before his death was
5,564,800,000. The
Ope Ope no Mi
, considered the "Ultimate Devil Fruit" due to its medical potential and ability to grant eternal life, is so valuable that the
Marines
were willing to pay as much as
5,000,000,000 for it, showing that the World Government is willing to and capable of affording such prices.
Donquixote Doflamingo
offered to sell
Riku Doldo III
the rights to rule Dressrosa for
10,000,000,000, in lieu for taking the country by force; Riku stated such a ransom is impossible to acquire by the Dressrosa kingdom alone.
According to
Nico Robin
, the value and purchasing power of belly has been reduced over at least the last century due to economic inflation. This was shown when Dorry and Brogy's bounties were re-issued after a century with the reward multiplying by 18 from
100,000,000 to
1,800,000,000. However, it is not certain that the worth of belly was exactly 18 times greater a century ago, given that the giants' bounties could have been raised due to their
present-day actions
after inflation was accounted for.

Other Currencies
[
]
Unknown currency on the wanted poster of
Gill Bastar
from
Wanted!
.
Although the belly is a universal currency accepted nearly worldwide, a few isolated societies use different currencies:
Extol
(
エクストル
,
Ekusutoru
?
)
is the currency used in
Skypiea
. Normally, it is written similar to the Belly with an "esh": only with an "E" instead of a "B":
. The extol seems to be
pegged
to the belly, as there are
10,000 per
1.
It is implied that there are a number of inhabited
sky islands
that use extol, as
Gan Fall
, who believed the Straw Hats reached Skypiea via cloud hopping, assumed they were already familiar with the currency.
Gor
(
ゴル
,
Goru
?
)
is used on
Amazon Lily
.
Nothing else is known about it.
Gold
(
金
,
Kin
?
)
is used in
Wano Country
. 500 gold is considered to be a hefty price. Nothing else is known about it.
Platinum
(
白金
,
Hakkin
?
)
is another currency used in Wano. One coin is apparently enough to build a whole house.
Silver
(
銀
,
Gin
?
)
is a third currency used in Wano. It is least valuable of the Wano currencies, and is used for smaller transactions. A shopkeeper was selling small pots for 30 silver and a large pot for 60 silver.
In the
Boss Luffy specials
, the currency
ryo-belly
(
両ベリー
,
Ryō Berī
?
)
is used. This currency has no banknotes, only coins, and mirrors the
Tokugawa coinage
that was used in real-life
Edo Japan
.
Wanted!
(
Eiichiro Oda
's earliest published work) features a currency denoted by two vertical lines over a
Z
. Nothing else is known about it, though it should be noted that the
Z
sign is basically identical to that of
Dragon Ball'
s "Zeni" currency
.
Inspirations and Influences
[
]
In both denomination and appearance, the belly is an almost one-to-one parody of the modern
Japanese yen
. The banknote personages, in particular, spoof the historical figures on yen notes:
Usaguchi Hideo
combines the ¥1,000's
Noguchi Hideyo
with the term for "rabbit"
(
ウサ
,
Usa
?
)
.
Kumaguchi Ichiro
combines the ¥5,000's
Higuchi Ichiyō
with the term for "bear"
(
クマ
,
Kuma
?
)
Gaikotsu Yukichi
combines the ¥10,000's
Fukuzawa Yukichi
with the term for "skeleton"
(
ガイコツ
,
Gaikotsu
?
)
.
