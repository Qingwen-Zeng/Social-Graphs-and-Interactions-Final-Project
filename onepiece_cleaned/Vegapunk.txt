Dr. Vegapunk
was the leading
scientist
of the
SSG
in the employment of the
Marines
. His work included discovering the secrets and uses of
seastone
, the secrets of how
Devil Fruit
powers work, the co-discovery of the
Lineage Factor
and its applications, the creation of the
Pacifista
and
Seraphim
, and various other scientific achievements that are said to be at least 500 years ahead of current technology.
He hailed from the technologically advanced
Karakuri Island
and resided on
Egghead
, where his laboratory is located.
Before being employed under the
World Government
, Vegapunk had been the director of an outlaw scientific research team known as
MADS
, where he worked alongside other notable scientists such as
Caesar Clown
,
Vinsmoke Judge
,
Queen
, and
Buckingham Stussy
. The team was eventually arrested, and Vegapunk was later integrated into the Marines as its head scientist after MADS' dissolution.
However, once the World Government learned he was researching the
Void Century
, they dispatched
CP0
and conspired with his own satellite
York
to eliminate him, which resulted in the monumental
Egghead Incident
.
Vegapunk would end up being killed by his old friend, Admiral
Kizaru
, during the ensuing
Buster Call
on Egghead.
Foreseeing this, however, Vegapunk left behind an important message regarding a catastrophic global future event to be broadcasted around the
world
in the event of his death.
First mentioned during the
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
, Vegapunk was a major background character throughout the series until his proper introduction during the
Egghead Arc
, becoming a major ally to the
Straw Hat Pirates
alongside his satellites and playing a central role during its ongoings.

Satellites
[

See also the associated category:
Satellites
.
At some point in the last six years,
due to being occupied with his inventions, Vegapunk managed to split his being into six different people, referred to as
satellites
(
猫
,
sateraito
?
, kanji literally meaning "cats")
or "offshoots"
(
分身
,
bunshin
?
)
, which share Vegapunk's brain via
Punk Records
. These satellites all identify as Dr. Vegapunk and will introduce themselves as such, but also possess their own names and number designations to distinguish them, making them effectively six unique people. The satellites are also distinguished by embodying a particular aspect of Vegapunk's personality.
Although they all have similar thought patterns,
they use different
first person pronouns
and speech patterns. His true body was called the
"Stella"
.
The method Vegapunk used in order to split his being into six different entities is still unknown. The destruction of a satellite's body does not mean they are killed, as they have countless spare parts to reupload their consciousnesses into.
During the
Egghead Incident
, York betrayed Stella and the other satellites,
personally shooting Shaka in the head, and having
S-Snake
crush Pythagoras.
. Edison was later disconnected from Punk Records while saving
Stussy
,
while Atlas detonated herself to ensure that the Straw Hats and Lilith would escape from Egghead.
Shaka, Pythagoras, and Atlas survived by reconvening into Edison's body, and the combined Vegapunk rebuilt himself using spare parts.
Stella was killed by
Kizaru
, which did not affect the satellites' survivals.
Appearance
[
]
Vegapunk was a relatively tall elderly man, having stood just under
Jinbe
in height (without his brain), with slender limbs and red cheeks. He had a noticeably elongated but neatly sliced head and had a shaft driven in to support a structure resembling the top of an apple-core and its leaf. His forehead was remarkably wide while his eyes were close to his potato nose. His tongue was incredibly long, reaching all the way to his groin, and was always sticking out of his mouth. He had a bald head on top, but had spiky white hair on the sides, as well as a thick mustache. He wore a short white coat with
SSG
on the back, a pink shirt with red polka dots, purple pants, and purple DOM shoes. Before he cut out his brain, the size of his head had supposedly reached the height of
giants
.
When he was 43 years old, Vegapunk had an enlarged head accounting for much of his height, and his hair was brown and covered most of his head. He wore a leather jacket, a white shirt, a belt, black pants, and dress shoes.
Three years ago, Vegapunk created
Punk Records
and transferred his enlarged brain there to significantly shrink his head.
When he was part of
MADS
, his head was much smaller with a bandage on the left side and lacked the mustache. He wore a Hawaiian shirt and goggles.
During
Kuma
's explanation on his
Pacifista
modification, he seemed to be wearing yellow gloves and a striped shirt with a white lab coat.
Personality
[
]
In his youth, Vegapunk was a generous person who cared very much for the inhabitants of his
island
, willing to help them with his inventions. He is considered the island's pride and joy, and the residents are still hoping for his return.
Each of Vegapunk's six satellites possesses a dominant personality trait that is presumably present in Vegapunk in general. While he had strong morals and a sense of justice and pride as a scientist (Shaka), he also possessed malevolent traits and an inclination to steal from others in order to fund his research (Lilith) and could be prone to greed and desire (York); there is considerable conflict and reasoning between these two sides. He appeared to be quite thoughtful and wise (Edison and Pythagoras) but could be prone to getting angry at other people's inability to properly replicate and utilize his technological developments, to the point of lashing out violently (Atlas).
Despite his many traits, Vegapunk was ultimately a man of great compassion with a strong sense of morality. Much like Dragon, he also despised and lamented the political corruption of the world under the World Govenrment's tyranny, but chose to turn a blind eye to it, using the resources they provided him to further his research for the sake of peace and prosperity for humanity. Due to his compassion, Vegapunk secretly programmed all the Pacifistas to make Bonney the highest authority to prevent a possible tragedy where Bonney, whom Kuma gave his life to protect, ended up getting killed by a fully modified Kuma or his clones by the World Government.
Vegapunk shares his ultimate goal of providing free energy to everybody.
Unlike his former fellow MADS scientists
Caesar Clown
,
Vinsmoke Judge
and
Queen
, Vegapunk was far more moral about what he would do in pursuit of scientific achievements. He refused to involve children in the gigantification process despite repeated failures and vetoed the creation or release of the
H2S
poison gas weapon for fear of it harming innocent people.
He also preferred to focus on developing peaceful inventions contrary to the dangerous creations of his former colleagues and was against the idea of converting people into cyborgs like Kuma that included stripping them of their own free will, memories, and emotions comparing this to murder. Likewise, Vegapunk also despised unethical human experimentation and was outraged to learn it was Saturn's experiments that led to the manifestation of the Sapphire Scales on Ginny and Bonney.
Vegapunk had a strongly idealistic and humanitarian side, proudly pronouncing his plans to use his future world-spanning inventions to help humanity and stop ongoing conflicts such as wars, even choosing to work for the
World Government
out of belief he could do more good for people by doing so. Unfortunately, certain people, like
Jewelry Bonney
, fail to see that side of Vegapunk as she was under the belief that he had no qualms with committing sacrifices and atrocities, personal or otherwise, in his aim for greater knowledge and progress. This infamous perception is wrong, as Vegapunk tragically cried when he carried out the order given by Saturn and opposed installing a self-destruct mechanism in Kuma, suggesting applying a device that would give him "two personalities" to give Kuma the opportunity to reunite with his daughter.
When Saturn ordered a
Buster Call
on Egghead, Vegapunk desperately pleaded with the
Elder
and Kizaru to reconsider, as destroying Egghead means destroying all the scientific progress made there, which would be a bigger loss to humanity than him personally.
He seemed to have an interest for dragons, as he created two of them on
Punk Hazard
,
and an
artificial Devil Fruit
that allows the user to transform into one.
However, due to his serious perfectionism, he deemed the fruit a failure since its dragon form was not the same color as the dragon form bestowed by the real Devil Fruit it was based on.
With a heavy heart, Vegapunk prepares to pull the switch that will take away Kuma's free will.
Given his nature as a scientist, Vegapunk had a natural interest in theories and the nature of science itself. He would elaborate on the works of other scientists if he found them interesting. When he heard that a certain scholar in the West Blue theorized that the human body loses 21 grams if they die, which was the weight of the soul, Vegapunk got so intrigued that he wanted to see it for himself, doing experiments on his thoughts and observing. In addition to the benefits of being an acclaimed scientist, Vegapunk was smart enough aware of the dangers of his job, especially regarding the
Ohara Incident
and the
Void Century
. Vegapunk considered it a scientist's nature to want to peek at answers, even knowing he had uncovered too much of the past to be kept alive. He knew that
CP0
was sent to assassinate him and prevent him from continuing his research.
Vegapunk took his survival seriously and did not hesitate to ask for help when necessary. He requested Luffy to get him off Egghead and away from the World Government when they moved to assassinate him, despite just meeting the young
Emperor
. He did not mind dragging others allies into helping him without considering their circumstances first. However, this doesn't mean Vegapunk was a coward who would abandon others to save his own skin and feel no guilt about what would happen to others because of his action. In fact, Vegapunk was willing to put himself in the line of danger to save Bonney after she was knocked down to the Fabiriophase, despite being the Marines' main target.
While Vegapunk was a man of science, he was not above believing in things outside of science. He expressed interest in the Sun God Nika and did not deny the possibility of gods being real. After Kuma's miraculous appearance on Egghead in time to save his daughter Bonney from Saturn, despite there being no logical way for the former Warlord to be able to move or even know about his daughter's situation, Vegapunk was so confused by it, but he decided to chalk it up to 'love' and the
Buccaneer
race's special power.
Vegapunk was also cautious as he knew the
Five Elders
would attempt to stop his pre-recorded message broadcast. He fooled them by using a
Den Den Mushi
as a decoy by disguising it as the Broadcast Den Den Mushi.
Vegapunk had shown he was remorseful of the World Government using the
Mother Flame
to power up the Ancient Weapon to destroy
Lulusia Kingdom
when he bowed down to apologize to everyone who was watching his recorded message.
He had a verbal tic in which he added "Quasar"
(
クエーサー
,
Kuēsā
?
)
to his requests for help.
Relationships
[
]
Satellites
[
]
Vegapunk, Edison and Atlas work together to crack York's code.
While Vegapunk's satellites all refer to themselves as Vegapunk, they each exemplify only one portion of Vegapunk's personality, and all have their own wills and desires and are therefore effectively six unique people. While this normally isn't an issue as Vegapunk was supposed to synchronize his brain with all of his satellites via
Punk Records
,
York
decided to betray Vegapunk and her fellow satellites in an effort to become a
World Noble
. Once her treachery was revealed, she was effectively treated as an enemy by Vegapunk and the other satellites.
When it was revealed that one of his satellites was leaking to the World Government his studies in the Void Century, he privately confirmed to Shaka that him and Pythagoras were the only two he trusted without question. Despite this, Vegapunk seemed to be on good terms with all of his Satellites (minus York), as he pre-recorded a message together with Shaka and Pythagoras about the truth of the world all while they conversed about scientific ideas and Vegapunk shared a coffee with them, even all of them jokingly spending the time when Vegapunk burned his tongue on the coffee, with Pythagoras worried and Shaka knowing it had that effect.
World Government
[
]
Vegapunk was once arrested by the World Government for his dangerous experiments in relation to research conducted into the
Lineage Factor
and
cloning
.
Despite this run in with the bureaucracy, he was employed as their chief scientist in the
Marines
. He would go onto becoming the leader of the
SSG
.
Despite being of great help in drastically increasing the Marines' military might with his inventions of the
Pacifista
and
Seraphim
, among presumably other things, the World Government has elected to kill him, which
CP0
was sent on a mission to do, due to the fear he might perceive too much about the truth.
Their fear was proven correct, as Vegapunk had studied all the books the scholars of Ohara had saved during the
Ohara Incident
and learned about the Ancient Kingdom. Understanding what the higher-ups would do were they to discover this, Vegapunk chose to keep it a secret, never revealing to them that Ohara had success in protecting their prized books. Vegapunk does not seem to view the World Government in a positive light, admitting to the Straw Hats he completely used all of the funding given for his inventions and only joining them to further his own research endeavors.
Having seen the horrid ways of the
World Nobles
, Vegapunk was disgusted by them and was shocked that York would want to become one of them.
Vegapunk cared about the staff that worked on Egghead. He never told any of them about his research into the Void Century so they wouldn't be treated as criminals should the World Government find out. He was horrified and outraged that Saturn ordered the ship carrying all the escape staff to be destroyed on the possibility that someone on board knew something.
Jaygarcia Saturn
[
]
Vegapunk fearlessly argues with Saturn.
Vegapunk seemed to display a particularly antagonistic relationship with Saint
Jaygarcia Saturn
. While they originally met on positive terms when Vegapunk was welcomed to
Mary Geoise
for winning the Ibel Peace Prize, that was where their cordiality ended, when Vegapunk witnessed the deplorable behavior of the World Nobles. Vegapunk and Saturn had argued on at least two separate occasions on the subject of the unethical nature of Kuma's conversion into a human weapon. The two seemed to have a mutual disrespect for one another, with Vegapunk fearlessly arguing with Saturn, whilst Saturn rejected Vegapunk's concerns and reminded him of his place. Saturn would eventually order Vegapunk's death for studying the Void Century, and went to Egghead, where he confronted Vegapunk personally.
When those meet in-person, they were hostile. Vegapunk was even more infuriated when he learned about Saturn’s actions that made Kuma’s life to be tragic for ruining his loved ones’ life. When realizing Kuma's self-destruction mechanism is not working, Saturn demanded Vegapunk if this was his doing, which he confirmed because he didn't install it to Kuma. Upon this, Saturn dubbed Vegapunk a traitor. When Saturn questioned Vegapunk on how Kuma was still able to retain his free will and attack him, Vegapunk cheekily told him the "power of love" was the answer. When Saturn learned of Vegapunk's secret betrayal by programming the Kuma-based Pacifista to obey Jewelry Bonney above all others, he furiously stabbed Vegapunk.
Sentomaru
[
]
When
Sentomaru
was a young boy, Vegapunk saved him, thus Sentomaru considers Vegapunk's safety as a personal debt. However, Vegapunk does mention this debt as a way to pressure Sentomaru into swaying his loyalty from the Marines to him.
Since then, Sentomaru served as his bodyguard, before becoming a Marine officer in between the timeskip.
Shaka
trusts his abilities and allegiance enough to put three
Seraphim
under his command when
CP0
invaded
Egghead
.
Vegapunk was deeply saddened to see Sentomaru struck down in order to help him escape, openly crying after Kizaru defeated him.
Sentomaru called Vegapunk "Old Man Punk".
Kizaru
[
]
Vegapunk was acquainted with
Borsalino
in his younger days as a Marine cadet as, while on a mission to a village to deal with a bear problem, they encountered a young Sentomaru who defeated the bears and requested to be Vegapunk's bodyguard and to be trained by Borsalino. The three of them became close as Borsalino agreed to use his
Devil Fruit ability
for Vegapunk to study for a future
project
and to entertain Sentomaru. As the years went by and with Borsalino eventually becoming an admiral, their relationship soured, with Vegapunk being more apprehensive towards him after he brought a Marine fleet to surround Egghead under orders, with Vegapunk claiming he hates this side of Borsalino the most, even bluntly telling him to shut up when he defended the suggestion of turning Kuma into a human weapon. Despite this, they were still on relatively good enough terms that he was seen eating and partying with Vegapunk and Sentomaru while Kuma and Bonney where at his lab.
Three and a half years later, the World Government deemed Vegapunk a threat and had sent Kizaru to kill him, to which he obliged with some reservations. Vegapunk, fully aware of how strong Kizaru is, held fear of and panicked when he managed to break into the Labophase to confront him. Kizaru has admitted to Vegapunk that having to kill an old friend isn't easy for him. Vegapunk had voiced his disgust at Kizaru labelling him a sad man, to which the Admiral does not deny and wishes he brought darker sunglasses. Tragically, Kizaru would be the one to deal the final strike that led to Vegapunk's death, ultimately showing their former friendship was not enough to convince Kizaru to turn away from his mission. Despite this, Kizaru was still conflicted about this, as when Fleet Admiral Sakazuki warned him about "better not have done a sloppy job", Kizaru asked the fleet admiral if he ever killed a close friend and angrily and tearfully retorted that if Sakazuki got time to doubt his job, he should come and see his work for himself.
Fujitora
[
]
Vegapunk seemed to be amicable to the newly promoted
Admiral
. He revealed a
new invention
to
Fujitora
that could lead to the abolishment of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
system.
Other
[
]
Caesar Clown
[
]
Despite once being colleagues, Vegapunk and
Caesar Clown
had a bitter rivalry based on levels of recognition and ethics. When Caesar's erratic behavior got out of hand, Vegapunk decided to dismiss Caesar from his position. Caesar was also considered second best to Vegapunk. Because of this, Caesar held a grudge against him.
Vegapunk also looked down on some of Caesar's achievements, such as considering the
SMILEs
to be unacceptable.
Bartholomew Kuma
[
]
Vegapunk and Kuma.
Vegapunk met
Bartholomew Kuma
when he came looking for a cure for his
daughter
's
disease
. After learning he was a
Buccaneer
, Vegapunk offered to cure Bonney for free in exchange for participating in his cloning project,
but he kept this a secret from whoever would be interested in that information. When
Jaygarcia Saturn
gave Vegapunk orders to erase all of Kuma's free will and memories, he was visibly angered by these demands and initially attempted to refuse them, only relenting because Kuma accepted these terms in an effort to protect Bonney, moving the doctor to tears. Over the next two years, Vegapunk and Kuma grew closer as friends while he conducted several experiments on him, including one where the latter was requested to materialize his memories through his own Devil Fruit abilities for Vegapunk to study. While Kuma at first refused, he eventually complied and allowed Vegapunk access to his now tangible memories. Vegapunk, out of respect, kept Kuma's memories locked up inside a high-security room within his laboratory.
When the time came to remove Kuma's free will, Vegapunk tried to reason with Saturn to allow him bare minimum will power causing the elder to refuse telling the scientist to remove all of his will on top of applying a self-destruct switch into him. Kuma hearing this asked Vegapunk to pass on a message to his daughter, telling her to have a happy tenth birthday, and to grant him his final wish as a human being, which was to program Kuma to protect the
Thousand Sunny
until the Straw Hats returned.
Before completing the operation, Vegapunk told Kuma he was a hero for his efforts to Bonney and many others for his sacrifices throughout his life completely breaking down in tears as he pulled the switch to erase Kuma's will.
When Kuma arrived in time to save Bonney from Saturn, he was left confused on how that was possible as it defied logic and reasoning due to his memories being erased and the shutdown switch that was activated by Saturn, coming to the conclusion it must be due to his
Buccaneer heritage
. Seeing Kuma is unable to move due to his injuries, Vegapunk ordered
Atlas
to carry him. His undying respect for Kuma's bond with Bonney led him to secretly programmed Kuma's Pacifista clones to make Bonney the highest authority to prevent a possible tragedy where Bonney whom Kuma sacrifice everything to protect is killed by the Pacifista.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Vegapunk seemed to have an interest in the
Straw Hat Pirates
because he learned from Kuma prior to losing his humanity about Luffy being Dragon's son and having similarities to Nika, as he saw no issue with granting the latter his final wish as a human to protect the group's ship, the Thousand Sunny, until a member of the crew returned for it. He fulfilled Kuma's last wish and programmed him to protect the ship for two entire years, despite his long-established history and connection to the Marines and to the World Government as a whole. One of his "satellites", Shaka even expressed an interest in meeting them after they appeared on the island of
Egghead
.
Also, at least one part of his other interest in the Straw Hats stems from Nico Robin and her past as the only survivor of the
Ohara Incident
, as Shaka was seen discussing the full scale as well as the aftermath of the Ohara Incident with Robin, revealing crucial information about the survival of the former
Vice Admiral
Jaguar D. Saul
, the safekeeping of all books of Ohara, his own study of every single book and thus his extended knowledge about the
Void Century
. Though he acknowledged them as pirates, he was shown to have enough trust in the Straw Hats to discuss and reveal important information about the Void Century as well as his own knowledge about it to the group, even ignoring their refusal to listen to such jeopardizing information. He was also not shy of indulging into his own past, which included his relationship with
Monkey D. Dragon
, Luffy's father and leader of the Revolutionary Army, much to the surprise of the Straw Hats.
Later, when he saw Luffy's
awakened form
for the first time, he was stunned about its existence, questioning the Straw Hats if they knew what that form was. He would then explain to them what he knew about this form as being the
Sun God Nika
, once again leaving them surprised. He even went as far as sharing his theories about why Devil Fruits were created with the Straw Hats, showing he had enough trust in them to share what he knew about human's most desires, as he was putting it.
When the Stella Vegapunk later encountered Luffy's group, he immediately recognized Luffy as the son of
Monkey D. Dragon
and asked him to take him away from Egghead. Vegapunk would explain his ultimate goal as well his background to the group, putting enough trust into them though he had just met them. He would even fall into funny interactions with Luffy about his extraordinary knowledge and Luffy's seemingly disinterest in such matters. His trust would go to such lengths as that he was considering Luffy and the Straw Hats the only people capable of taking him away from Egghead and keeping him safe from the
World Government
's clutches, a mutual feeling that was shared by Luffy who agreed to take Vegapunk with them. Vegapunk's faith in Luffy's abilities is strengthen by him being the Sun God Nika, believing even a Buster Call is a trivial problem for him.
Franky
, being a fellow scientist with a passion for creativity, is a huge admirer of Vegapunk since reading his notes on
Baldimore
and is increasingly impressed upon meeting the scientist (and his satellites) in person.
Nami
and
Usopp
, however, are more wary of him despite their impression on his genius, due to his inventions being a potential threat towards them and pirates in general. Nami vehemently objected bringing Vegapunk and his satellites with them on their ship because she does not want to deal the potential problems of doing so, despite the many advantages of having the world's smartest person as an ally.
Robin
is grateful to Vegapunk for protecting Ohara's legacy and revealing to her that her
old friend
she thought was dead was actually alive. Chopper is greatly impressed by many of Vegapunk's inventions, especially his medical purpose ones.
When Vegapunk went missing, Luffy and Chopper were searching for him, as the crew would not leave
Egghead
without him. Luffy and his allies freed Vegapunk from his captured and detained
York
. Later, when Vegapunk tragically died, Sanji would carry (unknowingly) his already dead body with him, not leaving him behind and still hoping Vegapunk would get up, all while protecting him from any harm incoming. After escaping Egghead, Sanji mourns for Vegapunk when he couldn't save him. Before he passed on, Vegapunk expressed to Sanji his dying wish for him and his crew to be the ones to ultimately find the One Piece, showing the utmost faith he has on leaving the fate of the world up to them. Luffy cries for Vegapunk while eating after he couldn't save him despite their promise.
Luffy called Vegapunk as "Old Man Apple" and like Sentomaru, he also called Vegapunk as "Old Man Punk".
Monkey D. Dragon
[
]
Vegapunk had a cordial relationship with
Monkey D. Dragon
, the Revolutionary. Though Vegapunk shares Dragon's contempt with the
World Government
's corruption, he did not join the
Revolutionary Army
when Dragon invited him, as he deemed the army to be poor. Regardless, the two shared their respect for
Professor Clover
and worked to ensure the famous
archaeologist
's death will not be in vain.
Also, those two do keep in contact with each other as it was Dragon who recommended the scientist to Kuma, who was looking for a cure for Jewelry Bonney.
Clou D. Clover
[
]
Vegapunk was a friend of the famous archaeologist
Clou D. Clover
, and one of the few people to know his true name.
He was devastated when the Government launched a
Buster Call
and propaganda against
Ohara
for their research of the
Void Century
, and paid tribute to the lives lost there by placing flowers. Despite his earlier hesitation on the subject,
Vegapunk also went to
Elbaph
to read the library of books that the
New Giant Warrior Pirates
retrieved and saved, intending to continue Clover's research and legacy.
Jewelry Bonney
[
]
Bonney forgiving Vegapunk
Vegapunk knew
Bonney
since she was a child. However, Bonney held a grudge against him for turning her father Kuma into a mindless
cyborg
, and upon meeting him, she threatened to kill him and demanded that he change her father back to normal, it was then unknown that Vegapunk would act in rebellion against Saturn by turning Kuma into a cyborg without conscience. Vegapunk has shown to understand the reason why Bonney held a grudge against him and wished to do something for her. After learning the truth, her resentment toward Vegapunk was redirected to Saturn.
Vegapunk greatly cared about Bonney's safety, putting her life and safety above his own. He especially worried about what would happen if Bonney, being a pirate, end up encountering a
Pacifista
or worse, her own father Kuma. Not wanting to see Bonney getting killed by a clone of her beloved father or Kuma killing his beloved daughter, Vegapunk secretly gave Bonney the highest authority over the Pacifista.
Stussy
[
]
Stussy
is the first successful
clone
that Vegapunk and
MADS
managed to create.
She was loyal to Vegapunk, and despite serving as a spy in the World Government for him for over two decades, she was awaiting for his orders to help him even if it meant betraying
CP0
.
She mentions to have visited
Egghead
in the past.
Stussy would protect Vegapunk from Rob Lucci, using herself as a human shield.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being held in regard by most of the world as the world's smartest man due to his natural genius intellect and Devil Fruit, Vegapunk had contributed to numerous technological developments and was seen as one of the most notable figures in the world. Vegapunk was notable for having formerly led
MADS
, a rogue research team involved in several scientific discoveries and development of weapons. After this, he began working for the
World Government
and became one of their scientists, holding a very high position within the organization as one of their leading scientific authorities for several years. Vegapunk was in charge of a number of highly advanced Marine and government facilities, such as
Punk Hazard
and
Egghead
. He was the leader of the
Marines
' scientific research and development team, The "Science Unit" (科学部隊, Kagaku Butai?) which is responsible for most of the special technology found in the hands of Marines, including, for example, the use of
Seastone
lining on Marine battleships, which allows those to cross the
Calm Belt
without disturbing the resident
Sea Kings
. Another major achievement of this unit consists of the
Pacifista
project.
In addition to the normal Science Unit of the Marines, Vegapunk was in charge of the
SSG
, the special science division, which provided advanced technology and weaponry for the World Government, including not only the Pacifista, but also the
Seraphim
, which the Government hoped would be able to replace the
Seven Warlords
system as one of the current
Three Great Powers
. As the lead Scientist of both units, Vegapunk was in charge of every other scientist and researcher on the island of
Egghead
, with this authority being shared with his Satellites, who split his workload and responsibilities equally with him in order for him to focus on new innovations. As the creator of the Pacifista and Seraphim, Vegapunk has command over all of them, and is able to give them orders of any kind as a result, with his authority being the third highest, being shared with his satellites and being overruled only by the
Five Elders
themselves, who lead the World Government, and Jewelry Bonney, who he secretly put her as the highest authority.
After the discovery of his research into the Void Century, Vegapunk was stripped of his authority within the World Government and Marines and was considered to be a security risk for the organization, so much so that the Five Elders ordered his assassination despite his importance and worth to the World Government.
Scientific Expertise
[
]
While it is unclear when Vegapunk started using his satellites to split his workload, he himself is famed as the greatest scientific genius the world has ever known, having tremendous knowledge and unmatched understanding in all fields of science, from cell biology to military technology, at the beginning of his work on
Karakuri Island
as noted by
Franky
. His scientific expertise is said to be at least 500 years ahead of his contemporaries.
It seems that even in his youth, the scientist was a prodigy already considered a genius, but lacked the skills, funds, and materials to develop his inventions, although that did not stop him from theorizing the creation of
Pacifista
cyborgs
, including their laser weapons back then. This is proven by the fact that Franky was able to recreate the technologies by studying the blueprints Vegapunk left behind on his home island. Regardless, the creations and blueprints that he has left behind are considered invaluable, and any damage inflicted to them is considered a crime.
The lasers that are installed into the Pacifista were apparently supposed to be so advanced, that only Vegapunk knew how to create them. It was also stated that the dragons found on Punk Hazard were Vegapunk's own creations.
Vegapunk had a deep knowledge and understanding of
Devil Fruits
, having studied many old texts about them. He was the only known person beside the Five Elders to realize the
true nature
of Luffy's
Devil Fruit
after witnessing his
awakened form
. He discovered exactly how Devil Fruit powers are transferred over to a user, and he was also the scientist behind the method of adding Devil Fruit powers into inanimate objects, such as swords and guns.
By using this method, he was able to create a unique blood for his latest creation, the
Seraphim
, by extracting the Lineage Factor of a
Paramecia
User, synthesizing it, creating the so-called "
Green Blood
". He even went as far as having developed a theory about how Devil Fruits came into existence from his knowledge, theorizing that Devil Fruits are the embodiment of what humans desire and could become, which is also the reason why the sea, which he calls "the mother of nature" rejects any Devil Fruit user and makes them unable to swim, as such behavior is loathed by the sea and it considers these wishes to transcend the world people wish to live in as "abnormalities".
Tactical Skills
[
]
Vegapunk was very cunning and deceptive when he needed to be, despite York saying he was a terrible actor and liar. For over 20 years, he researched the Void Century while working for the World Government without them noticing. In fact, the only reason the Five Elders were able to discover his treachery was because one of Vegapunk's
own satellites
betrayed him. Once he found about York's betrayal, Veagpunk (along with Shaka, and Pythagoras) had set up plans to make sure his death would not be in vain and would have the worst consequence for the World Government.
Vegapunk was also very skilled at hiding certain functions of some of his devices without others noticing.
Vegapunk also possessed impressive intuition, often correctly understanding the truth without solid evidence.
Medical Expertise
[
]
Vegapunk was an unrivaled medical genius, aided by his immense talents in medical biology including the applications of the
Lineage Factor
, which gave him great insights into biology and genetics, to the point of being able to perfectly create
Cyborgs
with partially or fully integrated bodies, create
clones
, and even out right produce artificial life. He was the one who modified
Bartholomew Kuma
into a cyborg,
and he has produced many
Pacifista
replicas of him as well, granting them some of the abilities of
Kizaru
's
Devil Fruit
in the process.
These replicas bleed actual blood, like Kuma himself. However, they lack Kuma's own
Devil Fruit
abilities. After the two-year timeskip,
Sentomaru
revealed that the latest Pacifista had been further modified;
these were later revealed to be the
Seraphim
, replicas of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
in their youth, albeit with
Lunarian
traits.
As noted by Chopper, Vegapunk also pioneer organ culture, the science of cultivation of either whole organs or parts of organs in vitro. Vegapunk also developed stem cell therapy which he used to cure Bonney of Sapphire Scales which is considered incurable by his contemporary doctors.
Perhaps Vegapunk's greatest medical feat is surgically removing his own giant head and part of his brain without killing himself.
Engineering Expertise
[
]
Vegapunk was a tremendously talented inventor, engineer and mechanic whose genius has allowed him to specialize and produce the creation of multiple inventions and technology so advanced, that it's been stated that it would take the rest of the world 500 years to keep up with him and his inventions. His skill is great enough to be able to develop a number of cutting-edge technologies, such as
Cyborgs
and Robots. In his early years, he was responsible for turning his homeland of
Karakuri Island
into a technological marvel, with the island being known as the "Future Island" for its tech and was responsible for turning a majority of the wildlife on the island into a Cyborg workforce to help build a lot of the tech that the island was known for. As the leading scientist of the World Government and Marines, Vegapunk was responsible for the creation of a lot of the technological advancements that they actively deploy, namely
Seastone
-covered battleships and equipment, and also various weapons from traditional military weaponry, to living weapons like the
Pacifista
and the
Seraphim
. Just like with
Karakuri Island
, Vegapunk turned the island of
Egghead
into a "Future Island" with a wide variety of advanced technology stemming from climate altering tech, to holograms and mechanized wildlife, to machines that automatically produce clothing and food, to even a state of the art lab facility built on top of artificially created
Sea
and
Island
clouds with advanced security. Like his early blueprints and creations, Vegapunk's many inventions on Egghead are immensely invaluable, with the destruction of any of them being a considerable loss for the World Government.
Oceanography
[
]
Via his research, he discovered ways of allowing
Marine ships
to pass through the
Calm Belts
without fear of a
Sea King
attack, by covering the bottom of the ships with
Seastone
.
Archaeology
[
]
Continuing Clover's research to honor his memory, Vegapunk has read and fully memorized every single book that had been rescued from Ohara. He was able to uncover many secrets from the Void Century and read the Poneglyphs which led the Five Elders to order his assassination for knowing too much.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Nomi Nomi no Mi
Vegapunk ate the Nomi Nomi no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allowed his brain to store an indefinite amount of information and eidetically recall everything he has ever learned. It also caused his brain and head to expand continuously as he acquires new knowledge.
While Vegapunk was already a natural genius, the Nomi Nomi no Mi absolutely enhanced his mental efficiency and aptitude for learning and research such as his scientific genius which is unparalleled compared to the rest of the world, making futuristic breakthrough in science and technology by at least five hundred years.
Satellites
[
]
Due to splitting himself up into six people, Vegapunk was able to be many times more productive as his satellites are capable of working independently at the same time. The fact that each of his satellites can also be equipped with weapons, vehicles, and technology also made Vegapunk drastically more difficult to handle in combat. The satellites are capable of communicating with each other via an earpiece and may also share senses as Shaka was able to see what was around
Lilith
while the two of them were in different locations.
Necessary bodily functions can be assigned to one satellite, allowing the others to forgo them. Currently,
York
is tasked with eating, sleeping, urinating, and defecating on behalf of the rest of the satellites.
One of the only downsides to Vegapunk splitting himself up into six people, is that the satellites have just as much free will and independent thought as the original Vegapunk, and are more than capable of thinking and doing things for their own self interests. York secretly had the ambition to become a Celestial Dragon, was not only prepared to betray her fellow Vegapunks, but even orchestrate multiple events and leak information directly to the World Government about Vegapunk's research, all in order to have Vegapunk and the other Satellites killed so the World Government would grant her wish of becoming a Celestial Dragon.
Scientific Achievements
[
]
The following is a list of the research projects done under the name Vegapunk, and it is unknown for some of them whether it was Vegapunk himself or one of the satellites that is responsible for them.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Early life
[
]
Vegapunk was born 65 years ago in the Future Country Baldimore on
Karakuri Island
. As a child, he designed and built several devices in his lab, including
robotic animals
. He also had hundreds of other ideas, ranging from weapons to experimenting with cellular structures. He once tried to create an in-ground heating system for the island's people using modified animals as his labor force. Unfortunately, Vegapunk lacked the tools and the funds needed to complete his project, but he was able to touch the people's hearts.
At some point, Vegapunk ate the
Nomi Nomi no Mi
, which caused his brain and head to expand continuously as he acquired new knowledge.
Vegapunk as part of MADS.
39 years ago, Vegapunk became one of the founding members of the illegal research team,
MADS
, working alongside
Vinsmoke Judge
,
Caesar Clown
,
Queen
, and
Buckingham Stussy
. While the other scientists focused on creating weapons,
Vegapunk pursued peace-promoting products, like the GP Flowers which earned him the Ibel Peace Prize.
This led to the
Five Elders
inviting Vegapunk to meet them in
Mary Geoise
.
36 years ago, Vegapunk also discovered the
Lineage Factor
,
and that same year MADS team successfully created a
clone
of Stussy.
26 years ago, the
World Government
felt threatened by Vegapunk's discoveries and experiments, especially those tied to Lineage Factor, and ordered his arrest through
Borsalino
. though Vegapunk brushed off the "arrest" and instead questioned him about the monetary funds he would eventually receive for his research projects, knowing full well that the Marines were in fact interested in having him within their ranks. Borsalino found this amusing and became friends with Vegapunk soon after.
MADS was subsequently dissolved, or rather, absorbed, with Vegapunk and
Caesar Clown
joining the government's research team.
Service to the World Government
[
]
After going to work for the World Government, Vegapunk became famous for his
Devil Fruit
research and for discovering that
Seastone
can counteract the effects of Devil Fruit on the user.
In that same year, Vegapunk met with
Clou D. Clover
at the entrance to Punk Hazard, with Clover requesting Vegapunk's assistance in researching the Void Century. Due to the heavy risk presented from such a task, Vegapunk denied helping. Upon hearing of the death of Clover's brother as a result of his name, Vegapunk remained adamant with his initial decision, although he agreed to remain silent on the matter.
Vegapunk worked with a sample of Kaidou's Lineage Factor, extracted from him when he was captured in Punk Hazard, to replicate his
Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu
Devil Fruit, although the
results
were noted to be unsatisfactory. The World Government wanted him to give the fruit to them, but Vegapunk considered it a failure and refused, leaving it on the island of
Punk Hazard
.
At some point, Vegapunk was with
Borsalino
and while on a trip to deal with a bear attack, encountered a boy named
Sentomaru
, who had already defeated the bears. Sentomaru revealed he was kicked out of his village and requested a job to Vegapunk. Vegapunk acknowledged the boy's strength and agreed to hire him as his personal bodyguard.
Later on, Borsalino agreed to let Vegapunk study the ability of his
Pika Pika no Mi
for a future
project
.
Vegapunk visits Elbaph and its library of books salvaged from Ohara.
22 years ago, Vegapunk would receive news of the
Ohara Incident
at his lab in Punk Hazard, taking note of Robin's Wanted Poster.
Several months later, Vegapunk took a trip to
Ohara
to pay his respects to the late Professor Clover. He came across the lake in the center of the island filled with books, and the realization that this was the final stand made by Ohara's scholars brought him to tears. Vegapunk noticed a group of
giants
pulling the books from the lake before being approached by
Monkey D. Dragon
, who had also come to pay his respects. Dragon explained to him that the giants were from
Elbaph
, and that they knew the value of the books. Dragon lamented Vegapunk's refusal to join the
Freedom Fighters
due to lack of resources, but Vegapunk explained that he felt his abilities were put to better use with the World Government. Though he wished to take the books with him back to Punk Hazard, Vegapunk feared that his superiors would hear about the survival of Ohara's library, and so he entrusted them to the giants. Vegapunk later took a secret visit to Elbaph to read all of the rescued books in order to carry on the work of researching them. There, he met
Jaguar D. Saul
, who had led the giants in salvaging the books.
Vegapunk tells Caesar that he is dismissed.
Four years prior to the current storyline, Vegapunk was leading chemical weapons tests in his lab on Punk Hazard. His former colleague,
Caesar Clown
, created an extremely
powerful chemical weapon
. When Vegapunk attempted to dismiss Caesar for his reckless behavior, Caesar retaliated by detonating that weapon, turning Punk Hazard into a wasteland.
The island was closed off after this incident and a
dragon that Vegapunk had created
was also abandoned. Since Vegapunk had been leading the experiments, he was blamed for the incident.
Vegapunk meets Kuma and Bonney.
Shortly after this event, Vegapunk was transferred to a new facility on
Egghead
, still under employment of the World Government, around this time Borsalino (promoted to
Admiral
under the pseudonym of Kizaru), visited him and got a look at Vegapunk's blueprint work for Egghead's construction.
At the suggestion of Dragon,
Bartholomew Kuma
decided to take his daughter
Jewelry Bonney
to see him in an attempt to cure her
Sapphire Scales
disease. Vegapunk was surprised by Kuma's sudden appearance, but quickly moved past it. When Kuma asked Vegapunk if he could cure Bonney's disease, Vegapunk confirmed he could indeed cure her, and explained that he would perform a stem cell transplant. Vegapunk was then shocked to learn that Kuma was a
Buccaneer
after checking his blood, although he had not enough samples to answer Kuma's questions about his heritage. After discovering this fact, Vegapunk offered to waive the expenses for Bonney's transplant, as long as he was allowed to clone Kuma. Kuma was shocked at the offer, but accepted it nonetheless, as Bonney's safety was his top priority, leading to the creation of the
Pacifista
human weapons.
During his time with Kuma, Vegapunk was visited by Borsalino again, which put him on edge as he knew he was there with a Marine fleet to which Kizaru defended himself claiming he was just doing his job. Carrying a Den Den Mushi with
Jaygarcia Saturn
on the line, he was not fond of his dealings with Kuma or him being used as the model for the Pacifista project; however, he relented on the condition that certain demands be made. The demands were that Kuma must become a
Warlord of the Sea
, that he must become a human weapon for the government, and that his memories must be erased for total control. These conditions outraged Vegapunk and he argued that these conditions would effective Kuma; however, Kuma agreed with these conditions as it would be the only way he could save Bonney, bringing Vegapunk to tears and leaving Kizaru distraught.
Vegapunk overhears Saturn's demands for Kuma's modifications and Bonney's cure.
Saturn asked Vegapunk how long it would take to cure the Sapphire Scales, to which he stated would be up to half a year and another full year for her to be able to go outside. Hearing this, Saturn decided to make Bonney a hostage and placed her under government watch, until Kuma's free will was completely erased. This angered Vegapunk again, arguing that both Kuma and Bonney would never be able to see each other again. Saturn brushed this off, saying that if this order is violated, Bonney would be made into a slave. While Kuma and Bonney went through with testing, Vegapunk began writing down his weapon ideas with even more ideas flowing through his head, wishing that there were five of him to keep up with his ideas. As the months went on, Vegapunk became close with Kuma and Bonney, eating pizza and partying with them, alongside Kizaru and Sentomaru, when they had the time. Vegapunk would also have Kizaru, Sentomaru, and Kuma help to construct more of the lab.
Six months later, Vegapunk happily told Bonney that in one more year she would be able to go out into the sunlight and told Bonney she could come back to the lab after she was cured, with Kuma thanking him.
About a year afterwards, Vegapunk had his large head surgically cut off and his brain removed and stored into
Punk Records
and replaced the top of his head with an apple top head. While Kuma underwent his modifications,
Stussy
commented on Vegapunk's brain removal, while also pondering on if Kuma's fate of being a human with no will would be worse than a clone with a will, to which he replied that she was human. Kuma questioned what would happen if he lost his free will; Vegapunk answered that it would mean losing human emotions and memories, but ensured Kuma that he would have at least one more year to retain bare minimum of consciousness.
Following the incident at
Enies Lobby
, Vegapunk was at Egghead talking with Kuma about the Pacifista's augmentation going well and asked Kuma if he was aware of the
boy
who declared war on the World Government, causing Kuma to reveal to Vegapunk that he was Dragon's son. Vegapunk was surprised by this news and mused with Kuma over the similarities Luffy's powers had to
Nika
. During this time, he enlisted Kuma's help in researching memories since the
Nikyu Nikyu no Mi
's ability could make them tangible.
With his research on Kizaru's Devil Fruit powers, Vegapunk managed to replicate them and manufacture functional and tangible laser beams that cause damage, becoming the only person in the world with the technological prowess.
His attempts to replicate
Paramecia
Devil Fruits resulted in the creation of
Green Blood
.
Prior to the
Summit War of Marineford
, when the time came for Vegapunk to perform the final operation on Kuma, he argued with Saturn on implanting a self-destruct switch on Kuma and attempted to reason with Saturn on allowing bare minimum consciousness for him before the operation, but the elder refused. Kuma had overheard this and finished his original agreement with Vegapunk to use the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi's ability to create a copy of his memories to study, Vegapunk then tearfully proceeded with the operation of removing the last of Kuma's free will while various doctors and Sentomaru prayed for him.
However, upon Kuma's request, Vegapunk programmed the mission to protect the
Thousand Sunny
into Kuma's memory banks.
At some point two years ago, Vegapunk managed to split his being into six satellites who shared his brain in order to help with his work. Together, they visited Mary Geoise at some point. While Vegapunk and most of his Satellites saw the
World Nobles
' cruelty as horrendous and looked down on them for it, little did they knew at the time that
York
secretly desired to become a Celestial Dragon herself, even if it meant betraying her peers.
Three months prior to the
Egghead Incident
,
CP5
investigated Vegapunk for researching the
Void Century
.
Prior to the
Levely
,
Admiral Fujitora
met with Vegapunk, and the scientist revealed the
Seraphim
,
which were the culmination of Vegapunk's research into cloning, cyborgs, Devil Fruits, and lunarians.
About two weeks prior to the beginning of the Egghead Incident, Vegapunk, Shaka, Pythagoras discovered odd discrepancies in the Mother Flame's energy output. Shaka quickly deduced that the culprit logically must be one of the Vegapunks, and that the three of them were the only ones that had alibis. The three concluded that they would have to continue observing in order to get more information. One week later, Pythagoras revealed that he discovered the culprit to be York, citing that her memories uploaded to Punk Records were invalid, and that the Den Den Mushi recordings of the Mother Flame room were tampered with. Vegapunk was shocked by the news, and immediately assumed it to be Lilith, due to her apparent nature as his "evil". A day later, the
Lulusia Kingdom
was obliterated through what Vegapunk assumed was an
Ancient Weapon
. Shaka suggested fleeing Egghead, but Vegapunk reminded him of the World Government's influence over the entire planet, and that escape would be impossible. When Vegapunk explained that their deaths were imminent and likely inevitable, Shaka and Pythagoras fearlessly stated their intentions to join him in his plan to reveal their knowledge on the
Void Century
to the world. Sometime later, Vegapunk would hide the Broadcast Den Den Mushi within the Iron Giant, pretending it to be nothing when questioned by York.
Shaka, Pythagoras, and Stella prepare to erase their memories.
Two days before the beginning of the Egghead Incident, Shaka would assist Vegapunk in his recording, setting up the Den Den Mushi and expressing his frustration in Vegapunk wishing to wait so long to reveal his message. Realizing that their behavior would be perceived as strange by the other Vegapunks, the trio decided the best course of action would be to erase their memories, in order to ensure their plans would remain undiscovered. After doing so, the three read a message that Vegapunk had written just prior and were naturally shocked by the overload of information that they had just forgotten being revealed once again in such a short time.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
While Vegapunk was working on a warping experiment, it backfired, and he got stuck inside the Iron Giant's armor. Luffy headed his way to help Vegapunk and freed him. Vegapunk then thanked him and recognized him as
Dragon
's son, knowing he would come to
Egghead
. However, he ended up flying too high in the air due to his boots and begged for help once more.
Vegapunk is threatened by Bonney.
Vegapunk later explained to the group his background, his satellites and the meaning behind
Punk Records
. as well as his ultimate goal to have a database everybody had access to. He was, though, confronted by an extremely angry Bonney, who demanded Vegapunk explain his reasons for turning her
father
into a cyborg, even threatening him with a beam saber she had found earlier. However, the saber attracted a horde of insects, and after she passed out, Vegapunk admitted to Luffy, Chopper, and
Jinbe
that he did not blame Bonney for hating him, well understanding of her resentment. However, he then added he had something he had wanted to give to her.
Vegapunk then excitedly explained to the group his ultimate goal of providing free energy for everybody around the world, mentioning the existence of an "ancient energy" that he believed was the Iron Giant's power source. However, because of his studies about said energy, he was fully aware he had uncovered too much of the past and that the Government wanted him dead, requesting Luffy to take him out to the sea with him and his crew. After Luffy agreed, Vegapunk told them to get to the Labophase, vanishing seconds later himself.
It turned out Vegapunk had warped himself into the Labophase, appearing in the Observation Room where the other Satellites and the Straw Hats were observing Luffy's fight against Lucci. He then clarified the true nature of Luffy's Devil Fruit, mentioning that there was no such thing as a "Gomu Gomu no Mi". He marvelously observed Luffy's Gear 5 form and explained to the Straw Hats that this form resembled a god from the ancient texts, who was supposed to be a
warrior of liberation
who would bring smiles to people, called
Nika
. Hearing that the Straw Hats never heard of this name, he explained to them that this name had been erased from history, but would always exist as long as people wished for him, concluding that all things were brought into the world with hope, including
Devil Fruits
. He then shared his theory about the existence of Devil Fruits with the Straw Hats, theorizing that every Devil Fruit was a possibility for human evolution that someone had desired beforehand. He concluded his theory by explaining that those with powers would exist in different dimensions dreamed up by someone else before them, leaving every single Straw Hat speechless at this theory.
Vegapunk then went on to explain to the Straw Hats how he was able to replicate Devil Fruits into
Artificial Fruits
, divulging that he could only so far recreate
Zoan
Devil Fruits, distancing himself from
Caesar
's
SMILE
fruits by saying his process was vastly different and more acceptable than his. He then revealed that he had found a way of replicating
Paramecia
Devil Fruits by synthesizing the blood from a Paramecia User's Lineage Factor. Vegapunk concluded his explanation by stating that the Seraphim are the culmination of all his ideas, referring to them as "The Strongest Form of Humanity".
When Luffy's group later arrived at the Labophase, Vegapunk was chased by a furious Bonney who demanded that he reverse the
Pacifista
modifications and turn her father back to normal, ignoring his pleas to listen to him. However, Vegapunk confessed that the process was irreversible, but he had a good reason for it.
Bonney, cunningly, turned herself into a child to divert Vegapunk's focus and, in a second of his carelessness, turned into a future version of herself and struck at him with
Distortion Future
. Vegapunk evaded her assault but was then successfully hit with
Toshi Tsuki
, turning him into a little child, unable to escape her grasp. She then once again demanded to know why Vegapunk took Kuma's personality from him, but Vegapunk once again replied he could not tell her due to a promise with Kuma. Bonney, however, was unsatisfied by this answer and angrily slammed the child-turned Vegapunk on the ground before turning her attention to a mysterious door. Vegapunk warned Bonney not to touch the bubble she had found there, but Bonney dismissed his words, throwing him off the room.
Vegapunk imprisoned alongside the captured Cipher Pol agents.
Vegapunk was then abducted
and imprisoned deep within the Labophase along with the other
Cipher Pol
agents who had disappeared after their visits to Egghead. He confessed to a CP5 member he had no idea they were locked up down here for so long, and also realized that their imprisonment was connected to his research into the
Poneglyphs
, which had been leaked to the
World Government
.
Shaka eventually found Vegapunk, but was then shot in the head by York, leaving Vegapunk surprised.
Vegapunk became furious and asked her if she was the one who imprisoned the Cipher Pol agents, but York replied that she wanted to be a World Noble. Vegapunk became confused and asked York why she would want to be like them. York laughed in response, further adding that the world only needed one Vegapunk.
At some point, Vegapunk was freed from captivity and reunited with Bonney near the PAW room. She then gifted her a sapphire necklace, apparently from Kuma, and clarified to her about his role in Kuma's transformation into a human weapon. Having learned the truth of what had happened, Bonney apologized to Vegapunk and happily accepted his gift.
Vegapunk then returned to the Control Room with Bonney, where the Straw Hats and
CP0
had gathered together after foiling York's plans.
Upon hearing from Stussy that the Marines had surrounded Egghead, Vegapunk asked Nami about her
Log Pose
while setting up a plan to escape to Elbaph. He planned to use the
Vegaforce-01
to fly the Thousand Sunny over the Marine blockade and assigned Lilith to be the robot's pilot. When he mentioned that the robot would fall outside of Egghead's airspace, Franky assured him that a Coup de Burst from the Thousand Sunny would guarantee an escape from the Marines. Since York had put a password on the Frontier Dome preventing anyone from escaping, however, Vegapunk, along with Edison and Atlas, began to crack her code.
Stussy protects Vegapunk.
While continuing to work on cracking the code, Vegapunk was alerted by Usopp that the Marines were beginning their assault. Vegapunk was confused by this, proclaiming that the island's defenses were nigh impenetrable. Upon realization that it was actually Kizaru on the island, Vegapunk felt terrible about Sentomaru having to fight him, and said it was alright for him to flee if he could not bring himself to do it. Sentomaru's defeat caused Vegapunk to break into tears, although he refused to give up on trying to get the barrier down. A moment later, as soon as Kizaru arrived in the Labophase,
Rob Lucci
attempted to kill Vegapunk amidst the confusion. Stussy, who noticed just in time, quickly stepped in front of Vegapunk and took the attack in his place, promptly collapsing to the ground, but saving Vegapunk's life.
Her sacrifice later enabled Vegapunk to successfully crack the password and disable the Frontier Dome's defense system, celebrating alongside Atlas and Edison for doing so. Having done that, Vegapunk then contacted Franky, asking if the Vegaforce-01 had been brought into position, not knowing it had gotten destroyed by Kizaru. Much to everyone's horror, including Vegapunk, Kizaru later appeared in the Control Room to fulfill his mission, but before he could execute it, Kizaru was grabbed by a giant Luffy, much to Vegapunk's surprise.
When Atlas said she was going to leave to regain control of the Pacifista, Vegapunk wanted to come with her to save Bonney after finding out she was alive, despite being told that the Marines were after him. He contacted Franky and Sanji of the situation and the two decided to help him. Vegapunk and Atlas then left the Control Room in the Vegatank-08 to go rescue Bonney, with Vegapunk saying he would not leave her to die.
Vegapunk entrusted Sanji to rescue Bonney before the tank could reach the Fabiriophase, and the group was successful in recovering her. As the group headed back up to the Labophase, they witnessed
Jaygarcia Saturn
's arrival. On the way down, Vegapunk requested that Sanji not defend him should he be attacked, to the latter's confusion. Vegapunk stated that his death would likely result in something huge taking place. He then brought up the topic of the One Piece to Sanji, telling him that he hoped the Straws Hats would be the ones to find it, adding even further to Sanji's bewilderment.
Kizaru then destroyed the clouds the Vegatank-08 was riding on, which sent it crashing onto the ground. Upon landing, Vegapunk's group was cornered by Saturn.
After Bonney tried to attack Saturn and was caught by him, Vegapunk's group tried to rescue her. However, they found themselves unable to move, which Vegapunk speculated was because of Saturn's Devil Fruit ability. They were forced to watch as the Marines raised their weapons to execute Bonney.
As Vegapunk was still unable to move, Saturn revealed to Bonney he was the one responsible for giving her and her mother
Ginny
Sapphire Scales due to a failed experiment. Vegapunk grew furious with Saturn for being the cause of tearing Kuma's family apart and hiding the disease under the guise of a bargaining deal, but Saturn dismissed this claiming he did not bother with the feelings of those beneath him.
When a Marine in the area notified Saturn that Kuma himself had arrived at the island, Vegapunk grew shocked as to why.
After Kuma punched Saturn, Vegapunk thought to himself on how this was possible as the self-destruct switch he was forced to implant in Kuma would instead shut down his entire body, coming to the conclusion that it must have been a specific aspect of the
Buccaneers
. Saturn then questioned Vegapunk on how Kuma could move as he had activated the self-destruct command days ago, but Vegapunk did not elaborate further beyond claiming that it was the "power of love". Vegapunk then ordered Atlas to carry Kuma back to the Labophase, but Kizaru intervened. Disappointed about Kizaru's role in all this, Vegapunk spared no kind words to his "friend".
Vegapunk witnesses the destruction of his work.
After hearing about the oncoming destruction of Egghead from a
Buster Call
, Vegapunk begged Saturn and Kizaru to call it off, as destroying Egghead would cause severe scientific setbacks. Despite his pleas, his concerns were met with contempt from Saturn, and silence from Kizaru. Saturn then elected to inform Vegapunk that he had ordered the destruction of a vessel carrying Egghead researchers. Vegapunk was horrified at the news, and angrily told Saturn that said researchers had nothing to do with his Void Century research. Saturn once again rejected Vegapunk's concerns, instead telling him that it was his own fault that the current events were transpiring. Moments later, the Buster Call began, and Vegapunk silently watched as his years of research on Egghead were reduced to rubble via bombardment. To make matters worse, Kizaru prevented Vegapunk's allies from escaping while Saturn ordered the Pacifista to shoot them down. Vegapunk watched and remembered dwelling on this specific scenario, citing that the Pacifista may be clones of Kuma, but none of them cared about Bonney or Kuma's friends.
Saturn impales Vegapunk.
Knowing that he could not let the very idea of Kuma attacking Bonney become a reality, Vegapunk quickly ordered Atlas to inform Bonney of her special status in the command hierarchy. Upon learning of this, Bonney ordered the Pacifista to help them all escape Egghead, to which they responded by attacking the Marines. Vegapunk thought about his life decisions while this was occurring, acknowledging that giving Bonney the highest position in the command hierarchy was his single selfish decision in his employment by the World Government. He knew that this would have severe consequences, which came in the form of Saturn stabbing him through the back with one of his legs. Vegapunk collapsed to the ground, and moments later, Bonney came to his side to beg him to leave with them. While this was happening, Luffy arrived back fully reenergized and in his Gear 5 form. Vegapunk weakly told Bonney that Luffy was Nika, the very being that she, Kuma, and many others had been waiting for for hundreds of years.
As Vegapunk laid on the ground from his injuries, Bonney told Luffy to avenge him by punching out Saturn, which he followed through on. Bonney then begged for Vegapunk to escape with her along with Atlas and Franky, but Vegapunk revealed to her that his injuries were nearly fatal and made it impossible for him to be moved without risking a worsening condition. Kizaru responded by attempting to shoot a laser at both Bonney and Vegapunk, but it was countered away by Sanji.
Kizaru delivers a lethal blow to Vegapunk.
Vegapunk relented on being forced to reveal Bonney's control over the Pacifista, and begged the Straw Hats to take care of her. While this happened, Luffy ordered Sanji to take Vegapunk away from the chaotic area as Saturn returned, now transformed into his full beast form. As they made their escape, Sanji was kicked away by Kizaru, who then dealt Vegapunk a lethal blow. As his heartbeat flatlined, a pre-recorded message activated within his Lab where he announced to the
world
that he was going to tell them a certain truth.
Postmortem
[
]
Sanji kept hold of Vegapunk's corpse as he and the other Straw Hats headed to the
Giant Warrior Pirates
' ship in order to escape the island.
Following their escape from Egghead, Vegapunk's body was laid somewhere within the giants' ship.
Legacy
[
]
Vegapunk's death immediately triggered the airing of his planned broadcast message, which successfully aired across the entire world. During the broadcast, the world's population was told what Vegapunk knew of the Void Century: namely about the
Great War
between
Joy Boy
and the
First Twenty
, and the usage of the
Ancient Weapons
causing global sea levels to rise 200 meters. Vegapunk also shared that his Mother Flame had been used to power an Ancient Weapon and predicted that the destruction of Lulusia would trigger the same sea level rise; this prediction came to pass shortly before he died and thus vindicated his message. Vegapunk warned the world that it would sink into the sea soon and the Great War had not truly ended so long as the Ancient Weapons still existed.
In the climax of his message, Vegapunk shared his belief that whoever found the
One Piece
would decide the fate of the world. This was shown to invigorate many pirates and further their ambition of finding
Gol D. Roger
's treasure; members of the
Four Emperors
' crews were particularly energized. This also caused some
Marines
to be motivated to find the treasure first before any pirate could.
Ultimately though, not all of Vegapunk's message was heard due to the efforts of the
Five Elders
to find and kill the transmitting
Den Den Mushi
; the broadcast briefly went offline while Vegapunk was talking about the
Clan of D.
,
and permanently ended before its conclusion as Vegapunk was sharing something else about Joy Boy.
Despite the death of Vegapunk's main body, his brain and Punk Records remained functional. Shaka, Pythagoras, and Atlas were destroyed, while Edison and Lilith hid their survivals from York by disconnecting from Punk Records. Lilith escaped Egghead with the
Straw Hat Pirates
and
Giant Warrior Pirates
, and set sail to
Elbaph
with them.
Edison was able to retrieve
Punk Records
from York, and the destroyed satellites survived by reconvening into his body, which was reconstructed using spare parts from all of the satellites except York and Lilith.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
In the original Japanese, the names of Vegapunk's satellites are written with
kanji
which have meanings that correspond with the aspects they embody. For example, Lilith's name is written as
悪
, with a kanji character that means "evil" while the
furigana
gives the reading
Ririsu
or "Lilith". In the
VIZ
translation, these meanings are presented similarly to epithets, such as "Lilith the Evil" and "Shaka the Good".
In the FUNimation dub, Vegapunk is given a German accent, as a clear reference to Albert Einstein who is his based on.
