The subject of this article is sometimes called
Califa
.
Kalifa
is a agent of
CP0
.
Before the timeskip, she was a an agent of
CP9
;
operating undercover as
Iceburg
's secretary at the
Galley-La Company
.
She is also
Laskey
's daughter and the older sister of
Alpha
.
She was one of the major antagonists during the
Water 7
and
Enies Lobby Arcs
.
Appearance
[
]
Kalifa is a tall, slim, and curvaceous woman with blue eyes and glasses. Like
Kuro
, she often pushes up her glasses. Her strawberry-blonde hair was about shoulder-length when she first infiltrated
Water 7
,
and she grew it out over the years she spent undercover there. She kept it tied up in a bun as a secretary,
but let it fall freely when she was revealed to be an assassin.
Her height is 185 cm (6'1"), and her
body measurements
are B93-W61-H92 (36.61"-24.02"-36.22"), making her breasts a G-cup in Japan.
She has small studded earrings and lipstick, and usually wears outfits that reveals her legs and cleavage, much like
Nami
;
something
Paulie
, who is offended by normal women's clothing, often chided her about while she was undercover.
When she was
Iceburg
's secretary, she wore a yellow long-sleeved jacket, and high-heel boots,
but as an assassin, she wore a long-sleeved short black dress over a fishnet shirt and stockings along with black gloves and high-heels.
As a CP0 agent, Kalifa's outfit is similar to her CP9's attire as she wears a long-sleeved short white dress over a fishnet shirt, stockings with a garter belt, white gloves and a white matching cape. She also no longer wears lipstick.
When attacking
Iceburg's mansion
she wore a musketeer mask and a long red cape with red long sleeves, as well as gloves and a light purple cloth over a light orange dress. In the anime, her gloves are dark brown, her cloth over her dress is white and her dress is yellow.
As a child, Kalifa was very bookish and wore a dress and glasses.

Personality
[
]
While undercover as
Iceburg
's secretary, Kalifa was shown to be a serious and business-like woman, and was seen to be dutifully loyal to Iceburg, accompanying him everywhere to remind him of his mayoral duties and attacking anyone who approached him without the proper respect. She is known for her trademark phrase "That's sexual harassment", which she often uses in entirely inappropriate situations, such as simply having her name mentioned. She is shown to be very bright by the ease with which she anticipates Iceberg's needs, and how well she meets his difficult schedule. She is calm, and tries to diffuse chaotic situations, such as trying to calm Paulie when he was shocked at Nami's revealing outfit.
After her true identity had been exposed, Kalifa's personality became sly and crafty, as she enjoys embarrassing her superior,
Spandam
by accusing him of harassing her, again with her trademark phrase.
Despite her initial impression of being completely serious and professional, she became easily flustered during her battle against Nami, such as when she correctly guesses the name of her Devil Fruit. She is rather absent-minded, and somewhat self-conscious about it, mistaking
Monster Chopper
for
Nami
and then denying that was ever the case the first place. Kalifa also got annoyed whenever Nami ignored her in favor of Chopper.
She is also rather vain, considering herself so beautiful and sexy that she does not need to make her skin smooth with her
Devil Fruit power
.
Despite her negative traits, Kalifa still seems to have a sense of justice as she, along with her other CP9 colleagues, saved a city from the
Candy Pirates
,
and she later accepted a flower as a gift from a young girl in that city.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Physical Abilities
[
]
With a Doriki of 630, Kalifa has a high degree of superhuman strength. She employs a kick-based fighting style when not using
Rokushiki
or
Awa Awa no Mi
techniques. She possesses formidable leg strength. Alongside Kaku, she could produce a cutting shockwave powerful enough to cut stone walls while using Rankyaku. She could even match
Sanji
's kicking power, and her attack speed is fast enough to leave residual images after striking. During the attack on
Galley-La Headquarters
, her fighting style was strongly intertwined with the use of her spiked whip, but she was not seen using this weapon after she ate the Awa Awa no Mi. During the timeskip, she had trained harder and after dealing with Spandine’s schemes, not only was she reinstated, but promoted to CP0, which is considered to be the strongest intelligence organization.
Rokushiki
[
]
Main article:
Rokushiki
Like the other
CP9
agents, Kalifa has mastered all six techniques of the
Rokushiki
style. Despite being the weakest agent of CP9's assassins, with a
Doriki
of 630, she is still considered one of CP9's strongest assets.
Weapons
[
]
In Water 7, she showed great skill at using a spiked whip. She could bind Franky, a powerful cyborg, and stop a Sea Train from moving away.
Techniques
[
]
Ibara Road
(
茨ロード
,
Ibara Rōdo
?
, literally meaning "Thorny Road")
: Kalifa leaps in the air and thrusts her whip out to decimate a group of people.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Awa Awa no Mi
Kalifa generating soap bubbles.
Kalifa ate the Awa Awa no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
which allows her to create and control soap bubbles.
The bubbles that Kalifa creates are capable of cleaning anything, they can even "clean" the strength off of her opponents. Once an opponents strength has been "cleaned", they are almost completely unable to move. Their strength comes back once the bubbles are no longer on them though.
The bubbles can also be used to lather an opponents body, making them smooth, slippery and glistening. When her enemy is in this state, their legs are too slippery for them to walk or stand, and their hands are to slippery to hold anything. Naturally, the weakness of this power is that the bubbles and their effects can be nullified if they are washed off with water.
She can also condense the bubbles into a giant bar of "soap armor" to shield herself from attacks. This bar of soap is strong enough to withstand a bolt of lightning from Nami's
Perfect Clima-Tact
without taking any visible damage. However, she is unable to move while incased in the soap bar.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Kalifa was born somewhere in the
Grand Line
.
As a child, she was separated from
Alpha
because emotions can become a weakness in
Cipher Pol
, so she was trained without family ties to become a good agent for this organization.
CP9's Secret Mission
[
]
Five years before the current storyline, four agents of the secret organization
CP9
took guises in the city of
Water 7
. Kalifa, as part of her mission, infiltrated the
Galley-La Company
by applying for a job as the personal secretary of
Iceburg
, mayor and former pupil of legendary shipwright
Tom
, in an attempt to retrieve the blueprints for
Pluton
.
Kalifa became infamous in the Galley-La Company for being fiercely loyal to Iceburg, and for violently kicking anyone who posed a threat to him.
Two other agents
Rob Lucci
and
Kaku
became a treenail specialist and a ship mechanic respectively, while the last agent
Blueno
became a bartender. While gaining the city's trust and respect, they tried to get close enough to take the Pluton blueprints in Iceburg's possession. Unknown to them, a year after they began their mission, Iceburg had passed the blueprints to Tom's other pupil, Cutty Flam, who had returned to the city as "
Franky
".
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Water 7 Arc
[
]
When the
Straw Hat Pirates
arrived in Water 7, they needed repairs to their ship. However, due to a tipping off from
Admiral
Aokiji
, an opportunity in the form of "Demon Child"
Nico Robin
presented itself; the CP9 agents blackmailed her to attempt a fake assassination attempt on Iceburg's life to frame the Straw Hats, and leave them to be taken to
Enies Lobby
, under the threat of a
Buster Call
attack. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats themselves pleaded with the
Galley-La Company
to fix the
Going Merry
.
However, the fake attempt on Iceburg's life was blamed on the Straw-Hats, who consequently got attacked by the Galley-La company, interfering with the already ongoing battle between Luffy and Franky. That evening, the CP9 agents planned to steal the Pluton blueprints and invaded Iceburg's mansion. They wore disguises, with Kaku and Lucci pretending they were defeated by the assailants, Kalifa attacking head on as a distraction, and Blueno going to Iceberg's room. Kalifa had a brief fight with Lulu, where she quickly dispatched him. The Straw Hats confronted CP9 after they had revealed themselves to Iceburg. Kalifa, along with Kaku, attacked Luffy with
Rankyaku
. The agents defeated the Straw Hats; but they realized that the blueprints were not with Iceburg, and discovered they were with
Franky
when Lucci deduced he was Cutty Flam and one of Tom's pupils.
Kalifa restrains Franky.
After this, they left the mansion; in order to leave no evidence of their attack and their identities, they set Iceburg's mansion on fire, trying to kill him in it. However, at the last minute, Iceburg and the Galley-La foremen were saved by
Chopper
. Since the CP9 agents had information about Franky's possible whereabouts, they invaded his secret hideout. Kalifa brutally knocked down
Mozu and Kiwi
when they tried to refuse them access.
Franky attempted to fight Kalifa, but was blocked by Blueno. After interrogating the shipwright and his refusal to hand out the blueprints for Pluton, Kalifa captured and disabled Franky with her thorn whip on Lucci's order, preparing for departure to the judicial island,
Enies Lobby
.
The CP9 agents boarded the sea train, with Kalifa acting as the spokesperson for the group and talking to
Corgi
.
When the Straw Hats tried to escape with Robin, she used her thorn whip to catch the carriage before Blueno pulled them back together.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Despite the attempts to rescue Robin, Kalifa and the other CP9 agents arrive at Enies Lobby. They meet up with the other agents of CP9 that they haven't seen in years, and their boss
Spandam
. Fukurou tests the Water 7 team's
Doriki
and reveals that Kalifa has a level of 630.
Kalifa and Kaku were given
Devil Fruits
by Spandam, and after the urging of Lucci, ate them. Both of them found the taste disgusting.
Kalifa faces Nami.
During the attack on the tower, she fought against
Sanji
after he came to his senses (he was struck by her looks and drank tea with her at first). Kalifa told Sanji that her key was "somewhere on her body", before they engaged in a kick-based battle. Even though Sanji was stronger than her, he kept withholding his attacks, and claimed he would never strike a woman. Kalifa showed no mercy, and after landing several hits on him, she turned him into a soap doll and threw him over the balcony.
Nami
arrived to confront her, but she had set a
bubble trap
on the floor, draining Nami's power.
Nami quickly deduced Kalifa's powers, much to her dismay. Kalifa used "Golden Awa" and turned Nami into a soap doll.
Chopper, in monster form, appeared and attacked with Kalifa, while she mistook him for Nami.
Kalifa is defeated by Nami.
Chopper knocked the bath down the stairwell, causing it to land on Sanji. Kalifa attacked Nami with "Shinaru Shigan", but Nami used her
Clima Tact
's Rain Tempo to nullify Kalifa's ability, before following up with "Fata Morgana" to electrocute Kalifa.
Kalifa, infuriated, attacked a final time, only for Nami to avoid and counter with Thunder Lance Tempo. Afterwards, Nami ripped Kalifa's outfit apart until she found the #2 key for
Roronoa Zoro
and
Sogeking
's handcuffs.

CP9's Independent Report
[
]
Kalifa cleans the streets of St. Poplar
Blueno used his
Devil Fruit's ability
, Air Door, to protect his fellow CP9 agents from the
Buster Call
. Since her clothes had been ripped apart by Nami,
Jabra
lent Kalifa his shirt. After realizing that Spandam had betrayed them and lied to get them to take the blame for the failed mission, Kalifa, along with the rest of CP9, walked along the
Sea Train
's tracks to
St. Poplar
. She cleaned the streets with her Devil Fruit powers to help earn money for Lucci's medical treatment. CP9 used the rest of the money to buy clothes and other essentials; Kalifa was with
Kumadori
reading a book and smoking while the others waited for them to return with the shopping. She smiled as Lucci, having recovered from his injuries, was discharged from the hospital. CP9 went bowling to celebrate Lucci's recovery, though her superhuman strength resulted in her essentially launching the bowling balls into the walls.
However, CP9 had to stop their bowling match to deal with the problem of the
Candy Pirates
attacking St. Poplar, so they became temporary vigilantes and beat them up. Kalifa used her signature kicks to deal with one of the pirates, as the crowd cheered, amazed at their strength. However, after Lucci violently eliminated the captain, CP9 determined that they could not stay in St. Poplar any longer. As they prepared to leave, Kalifa received a flower from a small girl,to the shock of Fukurou, Jabra, and Kumadori.
They traveled to the island where they had trained as children. There, they watched a new generation of CP9 being trained. Captain
Very Good
arrived to capture them, but they refused to let him disturb their old home. CP9 battled and eventually defeated the Marine troops led by Very Good, and Lucci contacted a physically crippled Spandam using a
Den Den Mushi
and promised that they would return someday. With that, CP9 began their plan to eliminate their former director and set sail from their homeland.
During the Timeskip
[
]
Sometime during the timeskip, Kalifa and the other former members of CP9 began training to become stronger. They eventually uncovered a plot in which
Spandine
was scheming some kind of takeover with former Level 6 prisoners from
Impel Down
as well as parties from the
Underworld
. They attacked and destroyed the parties involved and for their efforts were reinstated as agents of
CP0
.

On the fourth day of the

, fought the revolutionaries inside the
World Nobles
' residence.
CP0 guarding Vivi.
Later, CP0-group captured
Nefertari Vivi
, whom they took to a guest room in
Pangaea Castle
and kept tied to a chair. While the other agents of CP0 were playing cards, Kalifa and Jabra stood guard on their prisoner, who demanded they release her, threatening to tell the world what they did. Kalifa was not impressed and informed the princess that no one was coming to rescue her, that she would "disappear" and most likely be a pet to a
World Noble
. Here Vivi also asked the agents if
Shirahoshi
was okay, to which Jabra said yes. After the latter recounted the events that happened in the Levely,
Wapol
burst into the room
eating
the walls. The CP0 agents were confused of what just happened until they realized that Vivi had escaped.
