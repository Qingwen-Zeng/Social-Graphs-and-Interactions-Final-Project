Appearance

]
Spoil's concept art from the anime.
Spoil is a short old man with gray, wrinkled skin. He has a large jaw, elongated nose, a scar on the right side of his forehead over his eye, and a dark ring around the other eye. His chest has a long scar on it, and he is extremely skinny and has no muscle mass, causing him to look like a zombie.
He has a worn out green trench coat-like jacket that he wears open, tan slacks with a black belt, and a worn out brown hat. He also wears white bandages on his chest due to previously contracted injuries.
Because of the way he looks, Spoil is often mistaken for a
zombie
. He always carries a lamp around wherever he goes.
Personality

Spoil is a very kind old man who cares to get back the shadows of him and his comrades. His only desire is to walk in the sunlight one last time before he dies, which was fulfilled thanks to the
Straw Hat Pirates
