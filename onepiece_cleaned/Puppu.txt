Puppu
is the
captain
of a pirate crew who attempted to pillage
Nanohana
in
Arabasta
.
Appearance
[
]
Puppu's Jolly Roger.
Puppu is an obese and round man, with a very round face, bulbous nose, a row of rounded teeth, and gray hair sticking unkempt on the sides and on top of his head. His arms and legs are very thin in proportion to his wide frame, and his fingers are very thick and short. All this made Puppu resemble a pig.
He wears a simple white shirt that was untucked from his red pirate sash, blue pants, and simple shoes. Like most pirate captains, he wears a pirate's coat, but he wore the sleeves instead of letting the coat drape over his shoulders like a cape. His coat is brown in color and has five large buttons that resemble pig snouts. He also wears a tricorn with his
Jolly Roger
on it: a square pig's skull with a snout, rounded teeth, and a leaf on top of its head.
Personality
[
]
Puppu is prideful man, believing the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
to be pirates who sold their souls to the
World Government
, and are no more than their dogs. This made him believe that he and his crew were above
Crocodile
, a mistake that made him foolishly challenge the Warlord, which led to Puppu and his crew's defeat.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Puppu is more or less an average pirate by strength, as he managed to make it along the Grand Line to Arabasta. Being a common pirate, he stood no chance against the Warlord, Crocodile, who easily and swiftly decimated the entire crew.
Weapons
[
]
Puppu was seen carrying a large cutlass, but it is unknown how proficient he is in using it.
History
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
Puppu made a mistake in attempting to steal from a port city in Arabasta which was under the direct protection of Crocodile. Puppu insulted Crocodile for being a "government dog", and then when the Warlord jumped off of the building to greet the crew, Puppu and his crew impaled Crocodile with all of their blades. Thinking that he had won, Puppu's mockery turned to horror when
Crocodile
created a sandstorm
to drain the water content from Puppu and his crew's bodies. Later, Crocodile was seen carrying their bodies, stuffed into a large sack, out of town after the clash.
