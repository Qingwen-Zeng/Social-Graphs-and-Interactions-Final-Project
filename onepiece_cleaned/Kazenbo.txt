Kazenbo
was a flaming ghost-like entity created by
Kurozumi Kanjuro
, with the power of the
Fude Fude no Mi
, for the purpose of destroying
Onigashima
. It was created to symbolize the "burning hatred"
(
燃える怨念
,
moeru onnen
?
)
of the
Kurozumi Family
against those who wronged them.
Appearance
[
]
Kazenbo was a massive ethereal being, having the ability to fluctuate in size to the point of taking up the entire height and width of large corridors. It started out transparent at the bottom, but became much darker and more opaque towards the top, where it possessed two glowing eyes. Large flames burned along its edges.
Personality
[
]
Kazenbo was the manifestation of the hatred of the
Kurozumi Family
, particularly the entity's creator
Kanjuro
.
While it started out doing nothing other than going to the
location
that Kanjuro intended for it, it did appear as though Kazenbo had a consciousness and personality of its own, as shown by its response to
Yamato
's attacks. It was shown to have high reverence for
Orochi
, referring to him as "Orochi-sama".
Despite this reverence Kanzenbo did not follow Orochi's orders to burn Hiyori, going towards and burning him instead, likely from reaching its limit.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being covered in flames, Kazenbo was capable of burning anything it comes into contact with. Due to its large size, it was very difficult to avoid and thus was capable of causing tremendous destruction in a short timespan. It was intangible and capable of passing through any solid object, particularly walls and floors.
It appeared that Kazenbo could manipulate its shape at will, allowing it to generate appendages to aid in close combat.
Being made of flames, Kazenbo was vulnerable to ice attacks, as shown when it recoiled against
Yamato
's
strike
.
It also became substantially weakened when caught in a bomb's explosion.
History

Wano Country Saga

Wano Country Arc
[

As
Kurozumi Kanjuro
laid dying on
Onigashima
, his relative
Kurozumi Orochi
contacted him to give one last "encore" in the
Kurozumi Family
's story by creating a manifestation of their burning, unending hatred. Kanjuro thus drew and manifested Kazenbo with the power of the
Fude Fude no Mi
, and the entity was tasked with going to the
Armory
at the bottom of
Kaidou
's fortress which would destroy all of Onigashima. Kazenbo moved freely through the fortress, setting fire to everything it touched and causing much of the structure to burn as a result.
Upon arriving at the second basement level, it collided with the pair of
CP0
agents who were chasing
Nico Robin
, inadvertently saving her.
Kazenbo's efforts thwarted by Yamato.
Kazenbo made it to the Armory unopposed, but
Yamato
was able to get there at the same time and used his
Mythical Zoan abilities
to freeze the
explosives
, preventing Kazenbo from detonating them. Yamato then struck Kazenbo with an ice-powered
kanabo
attack, making it groan; Kazenbo then called out to
Orochi
as it manifested an arm-like appendage and hit Yamato with it.
Big Mom
then came crashing into the Armory unexpectedly through the ceiling, and detonated one of the bombs with her hand. Caught in the bomb's explosion, much of Kazenbo's form was destroyed.
The remaining wisp then ascended back through the castle to the Treasury, where Orochi was. When it emerged from the floor, Orochi commanded it to burn
Kouzuki Hiyori
, but Kazenbo instead set the
Shogun
aflame.
