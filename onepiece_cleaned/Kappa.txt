History
[
]
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
He wanted to join the rebellion against the
king
. However,
Koza
refused to let him join, because he was too young, and told him that the war is not for little children like him.
At Nanohana, when Mr. 2 (disguised as Nefertari Cobra) and his men set fire to the town, Kappa fell upon the secret of
Baroque Works
, as he witnessed Mr. 2 changing back to his original appearance, and learned that the king was, in fact, framed. He then ran into
Mr. 1
and
Miss Doublefinger
who proceed to attack him, in order to keep him quiet. Though he survived, he was too injured to tell the people anything and thus unable to prevent Koza from launching an attack on the capital.
Later, he was found by
Igaram
and got the chance to explain to all of the
Arabasta Kingdom
what really went on. It was his eyewitness account that officially ended the war.
