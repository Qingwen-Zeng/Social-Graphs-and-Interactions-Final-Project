from
Sandy Island
, and a friend of
Matsuge
the camel.

He serves as an ally to the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the

.
Appearance
[
]
Hasami in
One Piece Odyssey
.
Hasami is a red-shelled crab the size of a small house, with a human-like mouth in a perpetual leer. His claws are sharply asymmetric, with the right being much larger than the left. While he aided the Straw Hats, he wore a pair of
reins
hooked to the corners of his mouth, and bore a thick green matting atop his shell; it remains unknown whether the latter was some sort of
tarp
, or naturally-growing plant life.
Under the employment of
Ukkari Hot-Spring Island
, he now wears a
howdah
-esque carriage (large enough to hold dozens of average-sized
humans
) shaped after a
bus driver's cap
; its "hatband" is decorated with a scissors emblem, and equipped with a massive flashlight. His face also bears the resort's logo—
UKKARI
bisected by an old-fashioned rendering of the kanji for bathwater
(
湯
?
)
.
Personality
[
]
Unlike many of Arabasta's native animals, Hasami is completely docile, and quite willing to trust and help smaller creatures, including humans. Similar to his friend
Matsuge
, he has a lecherous interest in human women, and is easily "energized" by the sight of them.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Hasami's size is coupled with considerable speed, making him a highly effective
draft animal
able to carry numerous people over long distances. Like the rest of his species, however, he cannot swim in or tolerate water.
History
[
]
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
During the midst of
Operation Utopia
, while the other
Straw Hat Pirates
were escaping
Crocodile
's trap at
Rainbase
,
Tony Tony Chopper
learned from
Matsuge
that a friendly moving-crab lived nearby, and enlisted him as emergency transportation to
Alubarna
. While the crab easily accommodated all of them, he was soon overtaken by Crocodile's
abilities
, forcing
Monkey D. Luffy
to dismount and personally hold off the
Baroque Works
leader.
Notwithstanding this, the crab—whom
Nami
impulsively named "Hasami"—was able to carry the group about halfway to Alubarna before the
Sandora River
cut them off.
With Nami belly-dancing to motivate him, Hasami tried to overcome his species' aversion to water and scuttle across the river, but predictably sank. Afterward, he retreated to the near shore and waved off the Straw Hats.
By the time the Straw Hats—victorious over
Baroque Works
—left Arabasta, Hasami had returned to the outskirts of Rainbase, none the worse for wear.
Water 7 Saga

Gedatsu's Accidental Blue-Sea Life
[

Some time after the Straw Hats' departure, Hasami was found and enlisted by
Ukkari Hot-Spring Island
as a living
"bus"
, transporting the resort's patrons through undersea tunnels dug by the
Dirt Boss
.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
"Hasami"
(
ハサミ
?
)
is the standard pronunciation of the Japanese for both
scissors
(
鋏
?
)
and
crab claws
(
螯
?
)
. It is adapted as
Pincers
in all of the series' official English translations except the
Funimation
-dubbed anime, which favors
Scissors
.
