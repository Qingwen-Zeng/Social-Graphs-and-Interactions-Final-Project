Personality
[
]
Road seems to be a very careful and intricate person, who cares deeply for the lands of which he rules over. Upon witnessing
Muginn
and
Hilmungardr
be injured by the
Straw Hat Pirates
, he was outraged and sought revenge.
However, there appears to be an extent to this apparent care, as he burst into laughter after finding out
Glutbunny
had been killed, finding the action to be entertaining. He also appears to have a prideful side, being greatly annoyed at his captain's insistence on following Luffy.
In addition, he showed a bit of perversion toward
Nami
, referring to her as his "idol".
Due to his actions,
Gerd
considers him to be a greater shame than even
Loki
, who was regarded as the greatest shame of Elbaph.
Like many other characters, he has a
unique laugh
: "Defufufufu"
(
デフフフフ
?
)
.

Road is particularly well-informed about the seas near Elbaph; he was able to quickly figure out that the
Straw Hat Pirates
that ended asleep in his possession were victims of a slumber-inducing sea mist zone during their voyage from

Hajrudin pledged his crew's allegiance to the
Straw Hat Pirates
, and when he returned to

New Giant Warrior Pirates
informed
Mohji
of their resignation from the Buggy's Delivery
before setting out to sea in the

Straw Hat Grand Fleet

Final Saga
[
]
Elbaph Arc
[
]
Road was stunned when his pet
Muginn
brought him the
Thousand Sunny
along with several sleeping members of the Straw Hat Pirates. Realizing that the Straw Hats had passed through the Sleeping Mists that lie between Elbaph and Egghead, Road took advantage of the opportunity to imprison the Straw Hats inside the
Land of Gods
.
Later, upon returning to his room, Road was horrified to witness the
Straw Hat Pirates
battling and injuring the "God" animals that guarded the exit to the Land of Gods. Seeking revenge, he gave chase and declared that the Straw Hats would not escape.
Road is struck down by Zeus.
While he was annoyed that
Iscat
was unwillingly helping the Straw Hats to escape, he was quick to intervene. He used his staff to try to entangle them within a metal net, while proclaiming escape was impossible. He was shocked to see the net fail, but was then distracted by a few of the citizens of his diorama informing him that the
Ear God
had been killed. He burst into laughter from the news, finding the Straw Hats to be entertaining, and admitting that he had underestimated their abilities. Moments later, after proclaiming that the Straw Hats would serve him, he was confused to see clouds collecting overhead. He was then electrocuted by
Zeus
, leaving him reeling.
Road was apparently able to quickly recover, as not long after, he would flee from Gerd,
Goldberg
, and
Piper
up the bridge to Elbaph.
