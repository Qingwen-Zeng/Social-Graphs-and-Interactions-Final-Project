History
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After Black Maria captured
Sanji
, Nure-Onna and her comrades chased him until he fell, surrounding him.
Black Maria bound Sanji to one of her webs, and Nure-Onna watched as Maria battered him and demanded he call out for
Nico Robin
. He eventually shouted for her help, to Nure-Onna and the other Beasts Pirates' surprise. Robin and
Brook
came to the Sanji's rescue, beating back Maria and cutting down the web that bound him. The Gifters stared at Brook, who called them spooky monsters to their annoyance.
Brook defeats Nure-Onna and the others.
At some point in the fight, Nure-Onna,
Tenjo-Sagari
, and
Kunyun
used Maria's illusion mist to impersonate
Nico Olvia
,
Clou D. Clover
, and
Jaguar D. Saul
. They pretended to be the Robin's loved ones, to trick her into falling into their trap, but Robin saw through the illusion, smacking them with
Tres Mano: Freesia
. They were confused why the illusion mist did not work, and they chased after Robin and Brook as they ran through the
Banquet Hall
. Maria intercepted them, but after Brook dispatched
Wanyudo
, Robin faced Maria alone while Brook turned to face Nure-Onna and the other Gifters.
After Brook made a
wall of ice
between them and Maria, Nure-Onna heard screams from the other side and, peeking through the small gap in the wall, was horrified to see Black Maria defeated with the demonic-looking Robin standing over her. Brook took the opportunity to finish off Nure-Onna and Black Maria's other subordinates, with
Phrase d'armes: Orchestra
