Zeff
is the head
chef
and owner of
Baratie
. Before that, he was the
captain
of the
Cook Pirates
and known as
Red-Leg Zeff
, until his crew was annihilated in a storm.
He is also
Sanji
's cooking mentor and adoptive father, having taken in the boy after being stranded with him on a desert island for months.
Appearance
[
]
While still a pirate, Zeff had short blonde hair, which was somewhat unkempt, a mustache that he tied with light blue ribbons on each end, and a slight stubble.
22 years before the present, he wore a simple red-and-white vertical striped shirt with gold buttons on the collar. By the time he raided the
Orbit
, he changed to a purple and red, horizontally striped overall and braided his mustache. In either case, he wore dark pants with a light green pirate's sash and a captain's coat draped over his shoulders like a cape.
When he became the head chef of Baratie and was teaching Sanji his chivalry, his mustache has not been braided, as it is seen in the current timeline, and his goatee has also been shaved off.
As the head chef of Baratie, Zeff is an elderly-looking man who still retains his blonde-colored hair, which he keeps underneath his extra-tall toque. His mustache has grown considerably long, and he grew a beard. He wore his chef's uniform, with a blue ascot, and white apron. Also, since he lost his right leg, he has a peg leg and seems to have no trouble walking with it.
Personality
[
]
As a pirate, Zeff was fierce and uncompromising, willing to rob civilians without hesitation and commanding great fear from even his own crew. However, even at this stage, he was an idealistic
sea cook
at heart, believing in the fabled
All Blue
and deeply valuing food—to the point of violently forbidding his men from stealing any during raids. During his time as a castaway, this idealism rose to an incredible compassion, leading him to sacrifice all his available food—and his prized leg—to ensure the young Sanji's survival.
In his "retirement" as the
Baratie
's owner and head chef, Zeff remains hot-tempered and stern, frequently and humorlessly disciplining not only his own staff (Sanji hardest of all) but customers who annoy him. So too, however, remains his compassion, determined to spare even the most dangerous and irredeemable men from the starvation he once suffered.
Due to his great compassion, Sanji even believed that Zeff would be completely disgusted with him if Sanji had chosen to abandon his biological family to die by Big Mom's hands and even laugh at their demise despite how corrupt his family was along with the fact they had coerced Sanji by threatening Zeff's safety.
At one point, Zeff stated that he disliked children. Whether this is true of him, or whether it was simply made up to persuade Sanji to join the Straw Hats remains to be seen; however, given his father-son relationship with Sanji, he certainly appears to have made the latter the exception to this aspect about him.
Zeff also holds a strong sense of chivalry toward women, believing it is a man's duty to spare them all physical harm. As this includes his usual disciplinary methods, he has steadily refused to hire any female staff for the Baratie.
Relationships
[
]
Cook Pirates
[
]
One of Zeff's most precious possessions is his journal from his days as a pirate. He considers it valuable because it contains the memories of him and his crew’s journey in the Grand Line. This means that while his days as a pirate are long past, he still holds them dear and was not prepared to just let Don Krieg take this away.
Zeff was a tough but compassionate captain, as he would enforce his creed of never taking food from others by kicking any member who attempt to do so, yet mourned their demise to the point that he ceased wanting to be a pirate once he lost them to the wave.
Family
[
]
Sanji
[
]
Zeff and Sanji's shared philosophy of feeding anyone who is hungry before worrying about anything else.
Zeff first met
Sanji
when his crew was raiding the cruise ship
Orbit
that Sanji was an apprentice cook on. This first impression led Sanji to despise the pirate captain, but Zeff alone did not laugh at the young boy's dream of finding
All Blue
, which he shared, and a reason he saved him from being dragged overboard by a tidal wave. After the two became stranded on an island, Zeff gave all the rations he could find to Sanji, while keeping a larger bag of treasure for himself, without letting the boy know what was in it, and ate his own leg to compensate. Sanji would have let Zeff die on the island, but after finishing the rations and trying to take what he believed to be a larger bag of food from the pirate, only to realize the sacrifice he made, Sanji came to respect him.
While Zeff was always harshly critical towards Sanji, whom he calls "Little Eggplant"
(
ちびナス
,
Chibinasu
?
, "Little Brat" in the English dub)
; He did this to make Sanji into the great chef and tough fighter he is now. Despite objecting to it at first, Sanji seems to come to understand what Zeff was up to. Zeff also seems to be responsible for Sanji's strict code of never using any form of violence against women, threatening to beat up Sanji or even castrate him if he ever forgets this.
Zeff raised Sanji as his adopted son, as he believed it was his duty as Sanji's caretaker to instill knowledge in him, including helping him develop his cooking skills and teaching him the value of a cook's hands. Sanji's signature
fighting style
was developed as a result of this teaching, which included Zeff beating him up whenever he threatened his hands in combat.
Despite deeply caring about Sanji as his own son, Zeff tends to get particularly irritated with Sanji's lustful weakness towards beautiful women. When Sanji was a kitchen boy in Baratie, he would be instantly love struck by attractive female customers and end up making mistakes in his job such as dropping a dish. Zeff even once angrily kicked Sanji in the face for his unrepentant perverted behavior.
While Zeff seems to spend most of his time (besides cooking) provoking Sanji into leaving the Baratie, most see this as an attempt to encourage Sanji to leave so he could fulfill the dream that he and the old pirate shared together nine years ago. This shared dream proves to be a very deep and private connection between them, as the other Baratie cooks had no idea as to why Sanji remained at the Baratie, despite his constant bickering with Zeff.
When Sanji finally set out to pursue their common dream, Zeff found himself crying, and he was overjoyed to hear that Sanji had a bounty even when his face was drawn hilariously.
During the
Whole Cake Island Arc
, the
Vinsmoke Family
threatened to kill Zeff if Sanji refused to cooperate with the wedding with
Charlotte Pudding
. Sanji, seeing Zeff as the father figure that
Vinsmoke Judge
failed to provide, could not defy his birth family in fear for the head chef's life.
However, after Sanji rescued his father and siblings from Big Mom's clutches, Sanji explained that he did not want Zeff to be disappointed before disowning Judge once again, making him promise never to interfere in his life nor threaten Zeff as well.
Baratie Cooks
[
]
Zeff has also earned the respect from the other chefs of Baratie, as everyone there would stay and fight against the
Krieg Pirates
, and they were visibly upset that
Gin
would break Zeff's peg leg and hold him hostage.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Right after meeting him, Zeff forced Luffy to work as a chore boy on the Baratie as payment for the damage inflicted by unintentionally deflecting
Fullbody
's cannonball into the roof of the restaurant. However, Luffy's tendency to eat food meant for customers and clumsily breaking every dish that he was supposed to be washing was causing more trouble than help, and Zeff did not hesitate to accept Luffy's offer of dropping the debt in exchange for defeating the Krieg Pirates. Zeff was impressed by Luffy's determination and thought he would make it to the top in the Grand Line. Luffy understood how Zeff saved Sanji (comparing to how
Shanks
saved Luffy at the cost of his arm), and berated Sanji for nearly throwing it all away by being willing to die. After Krieg was defeated, Zeff wanted Luffy to forcibly take Sanji away with him, but Luffy politely declined, stating that while he wanted Sanji as his ship's cook, he would only accept Sanji if he agreed to leave the Baratie with him. When the
Big Mom Pirates
and
Vinsmoke Family
held Zeff's life hostage against Sanji, Luffy claimed that he would not let them harm the head chef nor the others at Baratie.
Enemies
[
]
Krieg
[
]
Hoping to rebuild his fleet after it had been devastated by Dracule Mihawk, Don Krieg attempted to capture the Baratie and obtain Zeff's log book from his days as a pirate. Krieg even ordered his crew to attack the Baratie despite the fact that they felt gratitude towards Zeff and the chefs for feeding them.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
When Zeff was a pirate, he was renowned for being both a great chef and a powerful pirate captain who managed to traverse the Grand Line. Zeff also retains a fair amount of knowledge of the Grand Line and piracy from his days as captain, as displayed when he knew about "The
Hawk-Eyes
Man" that
Gin
was talking about, and the fact that he knew some people referred to the first half of the Grand Line as Paradise.
He also knows perfectly well about
Devil Fruit
's and and the weaknesses that come with them.
He is a highly capable teacher as he could pass on
most of his fighting skills
onto Sanji.
Culinary Expertise
[
]
Zeff prepares Krieg food for a hundred men.
As the founder and head chef of Baratie, a famous sea restaurant of the East Blue, Zeff is a master chef who possess an extremely high level of skill in cooking. He is also the one that taught Sanji all his culinary skills and knowledge about cooking. He was able to skillfully cook enough food to feed one hundred men of Krieg's crew singlehandedly within a short period of time. According to himself, Zeff has culinary experiences that extend from the four seas to the Grand Line and Sanji is still an amateur compared to himself.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Zeff possesses extraordinary leg strength. He could easily break through rock and leave footprints on hard iron and overpower all his enemies effortlessly.
Even after his amputation, he is able to swing his peg leg with enough force to produce an air-current that can extinguish a half-dozen burning projectiles in mid-air.
He also remains extremely agile despite his age, often enhancing his kicks with elaborate jumps.
Zeff also has immense stamina and endurance, managing to survive 85 days without any sustenance apart from rainwater and his own severed leg.
Black Leg Style
[
]
Further information:
Black Leg Style
In his prime, Zeff was renowned as a master of extremely powerful kicks. Because of the immense power of his lethal kicks, his shoes were often coated in the blood of his enemies - hence his "Red-Leg" epithet. Even with a peg leg, Zeff can still fell a grown man with one kick, and even stagger Luffy despite the
Gomu Gomu no Mi
's natural protections against blunt trauma. According to Sanji, the force of Zeff's kicks far surpass
Kuroobi
's 40th-level
Fish-Man Karate
; after sustaining a
"Hundred Tile True Punch"
from the latter, he claimed that Zeff's kicks would qualify as "400th-level" by the same metric.
Notably (and despite training Sanji against the same), Zeff is also capable of hand-based attacks such as body-throws and punches. However, he has only been seen using these to discipline Sanji, rather than in genuine combat.
Weapons
[
]
During his initial meeting with Luffy, Zeff brandished a hand-saw that he "proposed" to sever Luffy's leg with. It is unknown if he has ever seriously used this device, for combat or any other purpose.

Concludes non-canon section.

Cooking George

When exactly Zeff became a pirate is unknown, though he was already
captain
of the
Cook Pirates
by the time of
Shiki
's escape from
Impel Down
twenty-two years ago.
For many years, he would build a notorious reputation as both a skilled chef and a powerful outlaw whose kicks could decimate countless foes, earning "Red-Leg" as his
epithet
.
Eventually, he led his crew into the treacherous waters of the
Grand Line
to pursue his dream of finding
All Blue
; though they survived a year's voyage little worse for wear, they found no hint of the legendary ocean, and quietly returned to the
East Blue
.
Shortly after, the Cook Pirates raided
a cruise ship
under a brewing storm. Overseeing the raid (and quick to punish any man who stole food instead of valuables), Zeff was surprised to find a young kitchen boy named
Sanji
trying to fight back, even withstanding a kick from Zeff himself. Despite the pirates' jeers, Sanji voiced his own dream to find All Blue; seconds later, the storm intensified and swept him overboard. Impulsively, Zeff dove after the boy, narrowly missing a rogue wave that smashed and sank both ships.
Sanji discovers Zeff's condition.
When the storm calmed, Zeff had successfully rescued Sanji, and salvaged two bags from the ships' remains: one of food, one of gold and jewels. Together, they were stranded on a small, rocky island otherwise devoid of life. While Sanji immediately blamed him for the situation, Zeff gave all the food to the boy, lying that the treasure-bag held his own portion. They then split into two camps on opposite sides of the island to watch for potential rescue; once alone, Zeff severed his right leg with a jagged rock and used it as food.
Unfortunately, months passed without any rescue. On the seventieth day, all his food long-eaten, a half-delirious Sanji entered Zeff's camp intending to take the "remaining" food by force. Shocked to find what Zeff's bag actually held, and what the old pirate had eaten to survive, he collapsed in tears. Near-dead himself, Zeff explained their shared dream of All Blue; together, they vowed that if they left the island alive, they would open a sailing restaurant that could feed any hungry seafarer.
Against all odds, the two castaways managed to survive another fifteen days until a passing ship found and rescued them.
Once recovered, Zeff spent all his remaining loot to launch the restaurant-ship known as the
Baratie
, Sanji staying on as his first employee and protégé. Over the next nine years, Zeff taught the boy all he knew about cookery, combat, and chivalry towards women, while growing the Baratie's personnel and reputation until it was famed among civilians,
Marines
, and pirates alike.
East Blue Saga
[
]
Baratie Arc
[
]
When
Luffy
came to the
Baratie
after accidental damage to the restaurant from the cannonball he repelled from Fullbody's ship, Zeff forced him into labor as a chore boy for a full year to pay for the damages.
However, Luffy continuously messed up in his chores.
Gin holding Zeff as a hostage.
Soon,
Don Krieg
attacked the Baratie. Zeff offered Krieg the food and water he had demanded in exchange for Krieg to leave the restaurant.
However, Krieg took the food but also demanded they turn the Baratie over to him as he planned on using it to sail the Grand Line and attack other ships.
Zeff graciously accepted Luffy's offer for his debt to be repaid in exchange for Luffy's help against Krieg, so Luffy would not cause further accidental harm to his restaurant.
Later after
Pearl
almost accidentally burned down the restaurant,
Gin
took Zeff hostage to prevent any further potential problems. Gin ordered the cooks to lay down their weapons or he would murder Zeff.
Sanji refused, telling him that he would not allow any more harm to come to Zeff as he owed the man for taking everything from him earlier. Sanji then revealed their past and how Zeff had attacked a ship he was working on as a small boy.
As Luffy battled, Zeff told Sanji that he believed Luffy would win. He told him that only those who have no fear of death on the battlefield can truly call themselves the strongest.
As Luffy refused to give in, he delivered a crushing blow to Krieg at the expense of sending himself into the ocean. Zeff explained to Sanji that Luffy is a true warrior without fear. As an afterthought, he told Sanji that Luffy would die as he cannot swim. Sanji could hardly believe how callous Zeff was to wait to share this information as he dove in to save Luffy, the restaurant's savior.
After the battle, Luffy continued to press Sanji to become his chef on his journey to the Grand Line. Sanji continued to turn him down as he told Luffy he must remain to repay his debt to Zeff. Zeff overheard Sanji's commitment and later after Luffy declined his offer to forcibly take Sanji with him, Zeff encouraged Sanji to leave the restaurant and pursue his dream for both their sakes.
Sanji finally agreed and the two barely exchanged any emotions, despite their long history. As Sanji's ship pushed off, Zeff wished him luck. Sanji broke down in tears and bowed in respect as he bid farewell to his previous life as a Baratie cook and began his new one as a Straw Hat Pirate.

After Sanji got his first bounty, Zeff and his chefs were so overjoyed that they would tell customers that Sanji came from the Baratie in an attempt to give the restaurant more popularity (although the crying laughter was more likely attributed to Sanji's horribly drawn portrait).

Adaptation Differences
[
]
Anime Differences
[
]
Past
[
]
The manga's depiction of Zeff severing and auto-cannibalizing his leg were deemed too shocking for television broadcast, and thus changed for
the anime
.
In the anime version of events, he finds his leg caught between the wrecks of the
Cooking George
and the
Orbit
when he dives overboard to save Sanji, and severs it with an anchor chain to free himself; though still deliberate, the actual dismemberment is never explicitly shown onscreen.
When these events were retold for the
Episode of East Blue
special, the anime-original scenes were excluded, implying that Zeff had, in fact, eaten his leg. However, the later retelling in
Episode 801
reiterates the anime's depiction of Zeff severing his leg to save Sanji.
Zeff severs his leg on the rock island.
Zeff's leg caught in ship wreckage.
Episode 801 version of the anime events.
Relatedly, the anime shortened Zeff and Sanji's stranding from the manga's eighty-five days into forty-seven. The fifteen additional days they survive after bonding over their dreams were also eliminated, resulting in them being rescued on the very same day.
Baratie Arc
[
]
In the anime, Zeff offered to give Luffy his log book that records the days he spent on the
Grand Line
, but was turned down because Luffy wanted to have his own journey rather than copy someone else's.
In the manga, when the chefs of Baratie pretend that they hated Sanji's soup and start pouring it out or breaking their soup bowls in disgust, Zeff breaks his bowl as well. In the anime, he criticizes the chefs for their actions and states that they shouldn't waste a single drop of soup and finishes his serving of Sanji's soup before insulting it.
Live-Action Differences
[
]
In the
live-action series
, Luffy does not destroy part of the Baratie with a cannonball, so instead of making him work as a chore boy to pay for the damages, Zeff makes him work because he did not have money to pay the bill after eating at the restaurant.
He is also the one in charge of tending to
Zoro
's wounds after his fight against
Dracule Mihawk
.
Later, after Luffy and his friends leave the Baratie,
Monkey D. Garp
visits the restaurant with his Marine subordinates, recognizing Zeff for having been a pirate some time ago. Garp asks him about Luffy, to which Zeff tries to pretend that he doesn't know who he's talking about, after which he offers Garp to eat at his restaurant. After offering the vice admiral a wine he had reserved for a special moment, Zeff begins to talk to Garp about what things were like in their generation when they were both younger men, commenting that at one point in his past he was in the brig of a Marine ship, and also telling an anecdote about how he hunted a wild boar in
Jaya
, which he ended up cooking. When Garp begins to get impatient because he wants Zeff to tell him what he knows about Luffy, Zeff sees that they have both observed that the boy is very similar to
Roger
in his attitude. Once Garp is about to leave to find Luffy, Zeff tells him that he won't be able to stop his grandson's aspirations.
When Luffy receives his first bounty poster, Zeff hangs it in the Baratie as an 'Employee of the Month' photo.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
In the original manga and anime, Zeff would frequently call Sanji "Little Eggplant"
(
チビナス
,
Chibinasu
?
)
and get called "Shitty Geezer"
(
クソジジイ
,
Kuso-jijī
?
)
in return. These nicknames were given varying treatments by different English translations of the series:
The
VIZ
manga gives both direct translations, as "Baby eggplant" (with occasional variations such as "Eggplant head") and "Crap-geezer"
The
4Kids
-dubbed anime changes the former to "String bean" while softening the latter to "Ol' geezer"
The
Funimation
anime, both dubbed and subtitled, renders the former as "Little brat" while also softening the latter to "Ol' geezer"
He was (alongside
Yasopp
) inserted into 4Kids' heavily truncated version of the
Reverse Mountain Arc
as a means of establishing the
"Grand Compass"
without
Laboon
or
Crocus
. Here, the explanation of the compass' workings (and the Grand Line's overall geography, including the first mention of
"Raftel"
) is rewritten to be advice he privately shared with Sanji shortly before Sanji left the Baratie.
His nickname is "Red-Shoes" in the Viz Manga and 4Kids dub and "Red-Foot" in the FUNimation dub.
In the anime, his name was written as "Zefu" in a newspaper during one of the
Loguetown Arc
filler episodes.
