Appearance
[
]
Gotti is a very large man with spiky light purple hair (dark purple in the anime) on the sides of his head and beard, although the top of his head is bald. Having lost his right forearm sometime after joining the Fire Tank Pirates, he had a giant red, green, and yellow (orange, black, and yellow in the anime) three-barreled machine gun installed in its place, which has a pulling chain as the trigger.
Gotti wears a black vest with a white suit underneath it, a green cape, a red cravat and black shoes with white polka-dots.
He has a large silver metal plate or shield (black in the anime) hung from his left shoulder, having his name and the same symbol as
Vito
's tattoos inscribed on it.
Personality
[
]
Gotti is a hotheaded man who acts very violently to people who disrespect his fellow crew members, and his violent rages are difficult for even his crewmates to stop. However, Gotti is deeply afraid of
Charlotte Chiffon
.
Gotti follows Bege's orders and ideas without question and carries them out with brutal conviction. When a
Door Homie
saw the pirates with Caesar and realized they were plotting something, Gotti wasted no time carving the homie's face out of the door.
Gotti's dedication to his crew was further shown during their cover story, when he courageously shook off a powerful Marine assault while the rest of his crew was being overwhelmed and attacked a Marine battleship by himself to save Chiffon.
Relationships
[
]
Crew
[
]
Capone Bege
[
]
As with the other crew members, Gotti is very loyal to
his captain
, whom he addresses as "Father". During the meeting between the
Straw Hat Pirates
and Fire Tank Pirates, Gotti was willing to intervene when
Luffy
stated his intentions of wanting to attack Bege and stated he would not let anyone disrespect his captain.
At the tea party, Gotti gave Bege his full support in his plot to assassinate Big Mom. He silenced a door homie to prevent it from alerting Big Mom of his captain's plan
and later prepared to fire a KX Launcher at the Emperor while she was in a vulnerable state.
Through his marriage with Lola, Gotti and Bege are now brothers-in-law.
Vito
[
]
When Gotti heard Sanji yell at
Vito
, he became very enraged and attempted to kill Sanji for the disrespectful act, despite Vito telling him to stop.
Charlotte Chiffon
[
]
Gotti is shown to fear his captain's wife,
Charlotte Chiffon
, as she was able to stop him from attacking Sanji and capable of dragging him by the ear. Chiffon also berated him for endangering
her mother
's plans by harming Sanji as it would have lead to fatal consequences for Capone Bege.
He is extremely loyal to Chiffon and even fought the Marines in an attempt to save her when he thought they captured her during the search for Lola at Dressrosa.
Through his marriage to Lola, he and Chiffon are now in-laws.
Other
[
]
Charlotte Lola
[
]
Charlotte Lola
is Gotti's wife. While working to save Chiffon from a Marine attack, Gotti inadvertently freed the identical-looking Lola who was in a similar predicament; he did not know she was not Chiffon until she kissed him on the cheek as thanks for saving her. Lola then proposed marriage to Gotti, her 4453rd marriage proposal. Gotti became the first person to accept, and the two happily wed shortly thereafter.
Sanji
[
]
Despite his immense value to Big Mom (and, by extension, to Gotti's captain Bege), Gotti threatened
Sanji
when the cook disrespected Vito. Sanji responded to his anger apathetically, causing Gotti to become even angrier.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As an assassin, Gotti likely has significant battle experience, which is also evidenced by his respectable
90,000,000 bounty.
Marksmanship
[
]
Gotti is a competent marksman, being trusted with firing one of the
KX Launchers
during Big Mom's assassination attempt. He was also able to cause significant damage to a troop of Marines by simply firing explosive shots from afar.
Weapons
[
]
Gotti has a giant, three-barreled machine gun installed onto his right forearm, making him a
cyborg
.
He was shown using it on Dressrosa to blow up some cargo near enemy
Marines
.
During the assassination attempt on Big Mom, Gotti attached a
KX Launcher
to his arm installment.
He was also seen with a cutlass, which he can use even with one arm. Gotti swiftly and cleanly carved the entire face of a massive door homie without causing any excessive damage to the door.
Gotti's metal plate on his left shoulder can also function as a shield, having used it once to block Katakuri's bullets.
History

Past
[

At some point after joining the Fire Tank Pirates, Gotti lost his right arm and replaced it with a machine gun.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[

Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Gotti threatens Sanji despite Vito's pleas.
When
Vito
entered
Sanji
's room on the
Big Mom Pirates
' ship and Sanji told him to get out, Gotti heard this and became enraged. Vito attempted to stop him as Gotti held his machine gun at Sanji, who responded by telling them both to get out. This enraged Gotti even more, but
Charlotte Chiffon
entered the room, telling Gotti that severe retributions would be exacted against
his captain
if anything were to happen to Sanji. Gotti fell to the floor in fear, apologizing profusely.
Bege's family and
his crew
took a captive
Pekoms
to an edge of a cliff at the northeastern coast of
Whole Cake Island
. Gotti watched as his captain shot Pekoms, causing the
mink
to fall into the shark-infested waters below.
Two days later, Gotti was with his crew in Bege's hideout as Bege prepared to meet with
Monkey D. Luffy
to negotiate an alliance to take down
Big Mom
.
When the Fire Tank Pirates met with Luffy a few hours later, Gotti attempted to attack Luffy when Luffy tried punching Bege for shooting Pekoms.
After
Jinbe
broke up the quarrel, Gotti sat next to Bege as the latter went over his assassination plot.
As guests arrived at the wedding venue, the Fire Tank Pirates acted as security.
When Bege went over the plan with
Caesar Clown
, the crew noticed a
door homie
listening to them, so Gotti cut off its face in order to silence it.
The Fire Tank Pirates went into Bege's body as he entered inside the wedding venue. As Luffy was causing chaos at the wedding venue, Bege told Gotti and Vito to prepare their
KX Launchers
.
After
Brook
destroyed
Mother Carmel
's portrait, Gotti and Vito waited patiently for Big Mom to scream.
Gotti, Bege, and Vito fire KX Launchers at Big Mom.
When Luffy successfully caused Big Mom to start screaming, Gotti and Vito exited Bege's body and they all aimed their KX Launchers at her.
They then fired the launchers, but Big Mom's scream detonated the rockets before they reached her, shocking Gotti and his allies. The alliance then tried to
escape through the mirror
that Caesar brought to the venue, but Big Mom's scream shattered the mirror. The alliance then found themselves surrounded by the Big Mom Pirates, who had been given
earplugs
by
Charlotte Katakuri
.
Bege then
transformed into a fortress
and the members of the alliance quickly retreated. Katakuri shot several jellybeans at the alliance, but Gotti managed to block them with his shield as he went inside.
As Bege's fortress came under attack by Big Mom, Bege swore not to allow his crew and family to die, causing Gotti to cry in happiness.
Bege later returned to human form and had Caesar carry him out of the venue. Gotti remained inside Bege and cheered for the Vinsmokes as they assisted Caesar in the escape.
When the Tamatebako dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau, the bomb inside the chest exploded and caused the castle to topple over. Bege's crew, Luffy's group, and the Vinsmokes got away during the castle's destruction. At the northwest part of Whole Cake Island, the Fire Tank Pirates and the Sanji Retrieval Team went their separate ways.
As Bege was pursued by Tart Tanks, Gotti was seen still inside Bege's body when Pudding caught up to them to ask for Chiffon's help.
After Chiffon left with Pudding, the Fire Tank Pirates returned to their ship and escaped Whole Cake Island. They then head for Cacao Island to pick up Chiffon.
As the crew reached the front of the harbor of Cacao Island, they were besieged by Tarteships. They were then contacted by Oven, who was holding Chiffon as a hostage to force Bege to surrender and Gotti was worried for Chiffon's safety. However, upon nearing the harbor, Bege shot Oven in the face and rescued Chiffon, much to Gotti's cheerful joy.
As the Nostra Castello moved onto Cacao Island with tank treads, Sanji used a kick to lift the carriage holding the chefs (including Chiffon and Pudding) and the substitute wedding cake onto the deck of Bege's ship. After the ship returned to the sea, Oven tried preventing their escape by boiling the sea, but he was thwarted by Pound, enabling the ship to sail away from Cacao Island.
On the way to the Thousand Sunny, Gotti watched as Sanji and Bege argued over what to do with the cake. After Sanji fed Bege his special ingredient and made him faint, Gotti and several members of the Fire Tank Pirates pointed their guns at Sanji until they saw the bliss on Bege's face.
When the chefs finally completed the cake, Gotti cheered for their success.
The Fire Tank Pirates later approached the Thousand Sunny and gained Big Mom's attention. After Pudding and Sanji left the Nostra Castello, the Fire Tank Pirates lured Big Mom away from the Sunny and headed for
Liqueur Island
.
As they were getting close to Liqueur Island, they planned on dropping the cake there. However, Chiffon insisted that they change course to
Funwari Island
to give Nami and her friends more time to escape.
The crew managed to reach Funwari Island but their ship was destroyed.
After dropping off the cake, they fled and stole a tarteship.

The Fire Tank Pirates then began the quest to find Lola.

.
They reached the
Red Line
but could not pass over it because of the
Levely
.
They went to
Dressrosa
to gather supplies
and learned that Lola arrived at Dressrosa a few days before.
Gotti then assisted Bege in searching for Lola around the country.
When he saw that a woman, whom he thought was Chiffon, was captured by the Marines, he chased after her
only to be beaten up by
Prince Grus
, one of her captors.
He recovered after the brawl and went after them once again, attacking the Marines at the port and rescuing the woman.
After getting her away from the Marines, Gotti realized that the woman was Lola
and was then surprised when Bege and Chiffon ran into them.
After this reunion, Lola asked Gotti to marry her,
however, the Marines came after them again, forcing Gotti to flee with Bege and the sisters.
They went to the port and found
Pound
there.
The Fire Tank Pirates and the sisters escaped Dressrosa on the Fire Tank Pirates' ship but left Pound behind.
As Pound was swimming after the ship, Gotti, Bege, Lola, and Chiffon helped him by giving him ropes to hold on to.
Gotti and Lola later married with the Fire Tank Pirates, Rolling Pirates, and Pound celebrating.
