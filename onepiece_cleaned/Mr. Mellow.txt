Dance Powder
, his shirt said "Half-Ripe"
(

and he did not wear the fur scarf.
Personality
[
]
Mr. Mellow seems to be a good leader and would do anything to be promoted, such as when he attempted to capture
Portgas D. Ace
for a promotion. He even goes as far as killing his own comrades to get promoted, as shown when he ordered the murder of
Mr. 11
. However, he appears to be overconfident in his abilities, when he went after Ace in vain.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a candidate for a
Frontier Agent
, he has some skills in fighting. He also appeared to possess some authority within the ranks of the Billions as he was seen leading the cause to kill Mr. 11 and capture Portgas D. Ace. He carried a gun to
assassinate
Mr. 11.
History
[

Past
[
]
Mr. Mellow and other Billions spill Dance Powder to frame the king.
Four years ago, Mr. Mellow was seen struggling to pull a cart carrying two oversized sacks of
Dance Powder
. When the cart's axle broke, he was able to jump out of the way in time to avoid being crushed by the heavy load. He was worried when the load broke open, as he said that he had orders to deliver it to
King
Cobra
. When people began examining the spilled powder, he and the other
Billions
panicked and ran away.
Later on, this was revealed to be part of the plan,
Operation Utopia
, in order to turn the people against King Cobra.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
Mr. Mellow prepares to shoot Mr. 11.
During the
Straw Hat Pirates
' arrival in
Arabasta
, Mr. Mellow and two other Billions boarded the
ship
on which
Mr. 11
was being held captive by the
Marines
. Being mistaken for
Millions
, the Frontier Agent ordered them to release him. However, Mr. Mellow immediately corrected Mr. 11 and told him that he was in no position to order around the Billions. Mr. 11 apologized to him and asked him again to untie him. He then told Mr. 11 not to be stupid and that he would rather have him dead to create an opening for the position of a Frontier Agent. Afterwards, he proceeded to shoot Mr. 11.
Later, when Mr. Mellow spotted
Portgas D. Ace
, he ordered
five Billions ships
to go after the wanted
pirate
in hope of getting a promotion. However, Mr. Mellow and the 49 other Billions he commanded were easily defeated by Ace's
Hiken
.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, Mr. Mellow's role is slightly expanded and changed. Rather than displaying the amount of authority he had in the manga, Mr. Mellow and the two other Billions by his side appeared to be subordinates of
Geronimo
. Whereas he simply shot Mr. 11 in the manga, he is given the order to by Geronimo in the anime. Also, instead of heading to their ships after receiving news of Portgas D. Ace being in the vicinity, he and his gang confronted Ace and Luffy in an alleyway. It was only after Geronimo's defeat in the alleyway that he and his men chose to chase after Ace on their ships.
Furthermore, although the Billion's ships are seen chasing Ace and orders can be seen being given, it is unknown who was giving orders. However, in the anime, Mr. Mellow and the other two Billions can be seen ordering the Billions' fleet to attack.
