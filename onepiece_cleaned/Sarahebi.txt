Techniques

Sarahebi's Are Trap
Are Trap
(
アーレートラップ
,
Ārē Torappu
?
, literally meaning "Oh~my~ Trap")
: Sarahebi and another member of the Beasts Pirates lure in an opponent by standing behind a screen and pretending to be a man seducing and disrobing a helpless woman. After the opponent breaks through the screen, they trap the opponent in a spiders web and spin around in tandem to roundhouse kick the trapped enemy.
The name of the technique comes from
are
(あれ), a Japanese interjection meaning something like "oh my" or "my goodness", which is what the helpless woman repeats as she is being disrobed. In the Viz manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Naughty Trap
.

Wano Country Arc
[
]
Sarahebi held a lesson to young children about the concepts of open and closed countries and the history of Wano Country.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Sarahebi traveled with the rest of the crew to
Onigashima
. After the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
invaded the island, she accompanied
Black Maria
to the third floor. They lured
Sanji
into thinking Sarahebi was being violated by a man and trapped the pirate.
When Sanji tried running away, Sarahebi and her group chased after him.
Black Maria later captured Sanji with
her webs
, and Sarahebi watched as Black Maria forced Sanji to call for
Nico Robin
. When Sanji actually complied with Black Maria's demand, Sarahebi was surprised. After Robin and
Brook
arrived, she was shocked when Brook, a living skeleton, referred to her and her comrades as spooky monsters.
Brook defeats Sarahebi and the others.
After Brook made a
wall of ice
between them and Maria, Sarahebi heard screams from the other side and, peeking through the small gap in the wall, was horrified to see Black Maria defeated with the demonic-looking Robin standing over her. Brook took the opportunity to finish off Sarahebi and Black Maria's other subordinates, with
Phrase d'armes: Orchestra
.
It is unknown what became of Sarahebi following the battle, but as a result of the alliance's victory, she was stripped of her teaching position and replaced by a Kouzuki loyalist.
