Kalgara
was a warrior of the
Shandia
who lived on
Jaya
around 400 years ago. He was renowned among his people as the
"Great Warrior of Shandora"
and feared as the
"Demon of Shandora"
by outsiders.
During his life, he befriended the later infamous explorer
Mont Blanc Noland
, and the two promised to meet again. However, both men met tragic ends before this promise could be fulfilled.
Kalgara died in battle against the
Skypiean forces
after a
part of Jaya
was sent to the sky by the
Knock Up Stream
.
Until his final moments, he regretted being unable to ring the
Golden Bell
to signal their presence to Noland. His legacy lived on after his death, as a statue of him was erected in the
Hidden Cloud Village
.
His bloodline also continued through his daughter
Mousse
,
and
Wyper
is his descendant.
Appearance
[
]
Kalgara's most striking feature was his long mass of red hair that extended down to his knees. He had red tattoos on both shoulders and, like all Shandia, a pair of small white wings extending from his back. Unlike his descendant who almost always keeps a stoic face, Kalgara was noticeably savage looking, with his wide, crazy eyes and a wide, mad grin making him more of a "demon" than his own descendant. He also had a muscular heavily built physique.
He wore purple laced-leg pants (similar in style to those worn by Native Americans) under a grass skirt.
Personality
[
]
Kalgara was quick to react and a strong believer in traditions of his people. He was hugely mistrusting of strangers. Kalgara's personality changed after he met Noland with many of his outlooks of the world changing alongside it. One particular note was that after seeing his God for what it truly was (a giant snake), he dismisses all Gods including the Skypieans "
God
".
A noticeable difference between
Wyper
and himself is that while his descendant keeps a stoic expression, giving the impression that he takes matters seriously; Kalgara in his first appearance, enjoys being intimidating to intruders, giving a deranged expression of slit-like eyes and wide grin, licking at the prospect of his fearsome reputation. This trait mellows down as he becomes friends with Noland, to the point he is actually crying for his friend to return someday.
Relationships

Family
[
]
Kalgara had a wife named
Herb
and a daughter named
Mousse
. He cared greatly for his daughter, but was forced to accept her human sacrifice for the sake of the
tribe
, even though this caused him intense inner turmoil. When
Noland
developed a cure for
Tree Fever
and Mousse was spared, Kalgara hugged her and shed tears of relief.
Kalgara also developed a bond with his son-in-law
Seto
, as they both held strong feelings of gratitude towards Noland and often went to ring the
Golden Bell
together.

Mont Blanc Noland

Kalgara laughing together with Noland.
Kalgara and
Mont Blanc Noland
were initially bitter enemies due to Noland slaying
Kashigami
. Kalgara considered Noland a god-killer who would bring disaster to his village, and was entertained when Noland was caught in an accident that Kalgara believed to be the gods' judgement.
However, Noland's words and honesty eventually got through to Kalgara and he began to trust Noland, saving his life from the
Child of Kashigami
.
After Noland cured the
Shandia
of
Tree Fever
, Kalgara and Noland became close friends, a first for Kalgara who had never been particularly friendly with anyone from his own village.
Kalgara even offered Noland the hand of his daughter, although Noland refused due to already having a family back in
Lvneel Kingdom
.
A schism was sparked between the two when Noland and his crew cut down the white trees which the
Shandia
believed to house the
spirits of their ancestors
. At this time, Kalgara's opinion of Noland briefly reverted to that of disdain and anger.
However, when the misunderstanding was resolved, Kalgara apologized and tearfully promised Noland that he would continue ringing the "
Light of Shandora
" until Noland returned.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Not much is known about Kalgara, except that he was considered the Shandia tribe's greatest warrior and has been shown to fight on even terms with Noland,
and killed a giant snake by himself, demonstrating he was incredibly strong.
It should be stressed that both his descendant
Wyper
, and the pirate hunter
Zoro
, both notable in their own right for their exceptional strength, could not so much as harm the snake
Nola
, although she is supposed to be much bigger than her ancestors due to nutrition in the sky and the decrease in the atmosphere.
He is also apparently very fast, as he has been known to swiftly dispatch intruders as soon as they appear on the island. Those that have heard of any legends about him often compare him to a demon.
Weapons
[
]
Like many others from his tribe he wields a spear, something he seems quite adept with as he used it to kill a giant snake.
He also uses a giant iron ball on a chain, in the same way Garp did, swinging it and utilizing it with ease despite its size.

Biography
[

Kalgara fights Noland for stopping the sacrifice of
Mousse
.
After their dying priest had a 'vision', he declared the only way to stop the "
curse
" that was plaguing
their land
was to sacrifice their most beautiful woman.
Mousse
, Kalgara's daughter, went willingly to the altar in order to save the rest of her people. She was about to be sacrificed to
God
, but she was saved by
Mont Blanc Noland
.
Kalgara fought against Noland and, after Noland was distracted by Mousse trying to kill herself, finally struck the explorer in the chest.
Noland declared that he could cure the village without needless human sacrifice and was given the deadline of sunset to prove this, or join Mousse and his crew on the altar. Kalgara then declared, at the first sign of trouble, he would kill Noland. Heading out to find the explorer he found
Seto
just outside, who had discovered that he carried the plague the day before. When Kalgara asks how he is feeling, Seto says "much better" to Kalgara's shock.
Kalgara saves Noland by slaying Kashigami's offspring.
The next day, an earthquake hit the island; thinking this is God's wrath, Kalgara rushed out to find and kill Noland. Kalgara mocked Noland after finding him trapped in a crack in the ground.
After
God's daughter
came to devour Noland, Noland pleaded with Kalgara one last time. Hearing the speech, Kalgara finally listened and killed the snake. As Kalgara stood there for a moment, wondering whether he did wrong or not, and unsure of the fate of his people, Noland ensured him things were fine. Later, after Noland cured the entire village of the illness,
Noland and Kalgara became friends and laughed and drank together.
Noland stayed on the island a few days longer, exploring what other trees and plants grew on the island. During this time, his crew found a
viper
; Noland and Kalgara found themselves laughing over the viper being the great snake's grandchild.
Having been convinced Noland and his crew were okay people, Kalgara showed them
Shandora
, the city of gold which his people protected. In the ruins of the great city, Noland was shown the
bell of Shandora
, which first brought him to the island, and the
Poneglyph
.
However, it is revealed that Noland and his crew cut down an entire forest, whose
trees
the Shandia believed to guide the souls of their ancestors, causing the Shandia to act towards Noland with hostility. Noland did so because the trees were the source of the disease that plagued the Shandia in the first place, and decided to leave anyway, as he and his crew were once again seen as outsiders. However, Kalgara realized the truth too late, as Noland's crew was already on their ship leaving.
This did not stop Kalgara though, and he rang the golden bell that first attracted Noland to Jaya, promising that he would wait for Noland's return.
Sadly that was not to be, as one fateful day, the part of the island they were on was shot into the air by the
Knock Up Stream
and into
Skypiea
, where it attracted the attention of the
"God"
of the time, who then proceeded to attack it and the Shandia in order to claim it as his own. Kalgara found himself struggling to breathe suddenly.
The last scene of him was shouting to his warriors that they must protect the land so that their friend Noland can return.
Legacy
[
]
He died honorably in battle never knowing the fate of his friend Noland. Kalgara's call to relight the light of Shandora would later inspire his descendant
Wyper
to attempt to complete Kalgara's final wish.
