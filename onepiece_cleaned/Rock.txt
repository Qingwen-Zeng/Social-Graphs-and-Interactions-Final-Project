Appearance
[
]
The brothers are a pair of furry giants, having long limbs and being covered in white fur all over their bodies except their fingers. It is unknown if they are actual yetis, although several characters believe them to be due to the strong parallels.
Their height dwarfs that of many giants. One of the brother's footprints is larger than
Brook
, who stands at 277 cm (9'1"). When the pair captured
Franky
under
Caesar Clown
's orders, Scotch held his entire 240 cm (7'10½") frame in just one hand.
They wear blue shorts and
bowler hats
which are frozen from the top. Rock appears to wear either a yellow tie or scarf.
So far in the series, they have been perpetually covered in shadows from the shoulders up.
However, their faces have been revealed in a
minibook
. Rock has straight, rigidly defined facial features resembling a
moai
. Scotch wears a gas mask with lenses and canisters that are visible even from his silhouette.

Personalities
[
]
The Yeti Cool Brothers are quite merciless as shown when they attempted to eliminate
Brownbeard
,
Zoro
,
Sanji
(in
Nami
's body), and
Brook
. They are willing to assassinate anyone they are asked to, so long as they are compensated. They are shown to be loyal to Caesar, as they follow his orders without question, which implies diligence to their employers in general.
They are also quite proud, and found it insulting that their targets,
Luffy
and
Franky
(in
Chopper
's body) were too busy fighting each other to notice the brothers attacking them.
Despite their reputation, they are apparently not very thorough as they believed they successfully killed Zoro, Brook, and Sanji (in Nami's body) when they only rendered them unconscious.
The pair is considered to be quite elusive, as Brownbeard said that no one knows what they look like and they never show themselves. When Scotch appeared before him, his face was completely shadowed. Rock, who was just outside, also had his face covered in shadows.
Scotch has a habit of saying "cool".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Caesar believed dispatching the brothers to be excessive to deal with the
Straw Hat Pirates
, so they are presumably strong and impressive fighters. They are, despite their tremendous stature, fast enough to instantly disappear from Luffy's sight and with enough subtlety to suddenly appear behind Nami and Chopper without either noticing.
The pair even managed to defeat Zoro, Brook, and Sanji (in Nami's body) seemingly effortlessly (though they later admitted to ambushing them with
KYP
gas to immobilize them).
The brothers know the environment of Punk Hazard, and possibly other arctic environments, very well, and they successfully incorporate their frigid surroundings into their fighting styles, such as shooting at icicles to dislodge them on foes
and fighting on cliff edges to trick and drive their foes off it.
Even with these advantages, however, they were shown to be no match for Luffy, even while he focused more on dealing with a rampaging Franky (in Chopper's body) than the brothers, in contrast to Caesar's original belief.
Outside of battle, their furry bodies grant the brothers great resistance to the cold, which enables them to walk around the freezing part of Punk Hazard with nothing more than shorts and hats (which are visibly frosted over).
On some colder days, however, the pair do seem to note the chill and cold.
In the anime, they were able to move at speeds rivaling
Soru
to evade Luffy's Gear Second attacks.
Despite these abilities, they do not appear to be very resilient, even for their size: It only took one heavy attack each (Rock being hit by the tip of a mountain, thrown by Franky in an uncontrolled Monster Chopper state, and Scotch hit by Law's Counter-Shock attack) before they were both knocked completely unconscious.
Attacks
[
]
Tsurara Kenzan
(
つらら剣山
,
Tsurara Kenzan
?
, literally meaning "Icicle Needle-Point Holder")
: The brothers use their knowledge of the environment of Punk Hazard to lead their foes into falling off a cliff onto a bed of towering icicles where they will be skewered. This was first used in an attempt to kill a falling Luffy.
In the FUNimation subs, it is called
Ice Spikes
.
Weapons
[
]
The brothers each carry a giant-sized rifle which appears to provide their primary method of attack. The standard rounds they use are explosive, but the pair also have
specialized gas
rounds that can cause intoxication and/or drowsiness.
Rock also mentioned they have used
poison
gas.
Scotch wears a gas mask, which protects him from their own gas-ammunition. He was also shown to wield a large knife, though his proficiency with it is unknown as Trafalgar Law electrocuted him before he could take a swipe.
History
[

Dressrosa Saga
[

Punk Hazard Arc
[
]
The Yeti Cool Brothers were summoned by
Caesar Clown
to deal with the
Straw Hat Pirates
on
Punk Hazard
. Outside one of the abandoned labs that the crew was residing in,
Sanji
(in
Nami
's body),
Roronoa Zoro
, and
Brook
were searching for
Kin'emon
and discovered giant footprints, which the brothers left for them to follow. Once they reached the edge of a cliff, the brothers ambushed them and fired KYP bullets, sending the three Straw Hats falling into section F-16, which had the icicle pincushion on a plateau.
Scotch prepares to kill Brownbeard under Caesar's orders.
During a conversation with one of Caesar's guards, they erroneously informed him that they killed Sanji, Brook, and Zoro and told him to send a team to collect the bodies before heading off to where the kids were. When the brothers reached the Straw Hats' hideout,
Monkey D. Luffy
discovered them and turned back, but not before the brothers attacked
Brownbeard
and captured Nami (in
Franky
's body).
Luffy and Franky (in
Tony Tony Chopper
's body) pursued the brothers, who proceeded to set up an Icicle Pincushion ambush. Luffy fell into the trap, but easily destroyed it unharmed with a
Haki
-enhanced
Gomu Gomu no Gatling Gun
. Rock then fired several shots at Luffy, whose rubber body reflected the bullets with enhanced force right back at Rock. Scotch then fired a shot at a mountain top, dislodging a massive ice shard over Luffy and Franky. Rock used this as an opportunity to prepare another attack, but Franky (in Chopper's
Monster Point
) grabbed the shard and smashed it into Rock, knocking him out cold.
Law cuts Scotch in half.
Scotch grabbed Nami and started making his way toward the plateau where the research facility was built. After reaching the plateau, he saw
Trafalgar Law
and appealed for his help. To Scotch's surprise, Law
bisected
him at the waist and delivered a powerful electric shock that completely incapacitated him.
After the events on Punk Hazard, the Yeti Cool Brothers' status is unknown.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The size of the Brothers, or at least their feet, differ greatly between media. The big toe is about the size of Brook's afro in the manga, while even the smallest toe is larger than his afro in the anime.
