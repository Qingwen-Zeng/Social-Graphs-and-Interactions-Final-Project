"Black Cage" Hina
is a
Marine officer
and a former classmate of
Vice Admiral
Smoker
.
She currently leads the
Black Cage Corps
, a unit (containing
Jango
and
Fullbody
among others) tasked with patrolling the seas around the
Arabasta Kingdom
.
Originally introduced as a
captain
, she was promoted to the rank of
rear admiral
some time after the
Summit War of Marineford
.
Appearance
[
]
Hina is a tall, slim woman with dark brown eyes and straight, waist-length pink hair worn in a middle part. She wears dark red lipstick and is sometimes seen smoking a cigarette.
During her first appearance, she wore a burgundy-purple two-piece suit over a white blouse, as well as dark brown shoes and a pair of dark gloves.
Her second outfit consists of a cleavage-revealing purple shirt with a deep neckline and golden motifs on the front, matching long pants, and high-heeled shoes. She also sports a bead necklace around her neck and a pair of purple sunglasses either covering her eyes or on her forehead.
As with most Marines, Hina often accompanies her outfit with a long white Marine jacket draped over her shoulders like a cape. The only difference is that she retains her signature color on the epaulettes, which was light blue, while Marines officers normally have red and blue epaulettes.
As a child, she had the same haircut but with shorter hair. She wore a plain striped dress and shoes. She was depicted as keeping several pet birds and rhinoceros beetles in cages, in reference to her Devil Fruit.
Personality
[
]
Hina is immensely sober and dignified, rarely showing any significant emotion even in defeat. Though not sadistic or fanatical like many other high-ranking Marines, she is ruthlessly pragmatic in her work, and willing to exploit any possible advantage over criminals. At the same time, she is fairly tolerant of unprofessionalism from other Marines, even her direct subordinates.
Contrasting her coolheaded demeanor, Hina routinely speaks in the third person (
e.g.
, "Hina failed"), a trait stereotypical of young children and women trying to affect an "innocent" air. Her reasons for this, if any, remain unknown.
Hina also seems to be quite knowledgeable on historical facts, such as the legendary
Rocks Pirates
,
whose existence is only more commonly known among older Marines (
e.g.
Garp
and
Sengoku
) rather than most Marines of her generation.
Relationships

Smoker
[
]
Smoker and Hina working together in a mission.
Hina is a long-time friend of
Vice Admiral
Smoker
, having joined the Marines at the same time he did. She has helped him escape from situations that could have gotten him fired.
Because they have known each other for a long time, Hina calls him Smoker-kun (a Japanese honorific used usually for younger peers) while Smoker addresses Hina by her name alone (which, in Japanese, shows either a sign of disrespect or closeness).
Jango and Fullbody
[
]
Jango and Fullbody offer flowers to Hina, while she focuses on giving orders to them.
Jango
and
Fullbody
tend to follow Hina around. She does not respond to their words of adoration, but she also seems to be rather forgiving of them when they goof off and dance, as they usually do. She took them in as subordinates in recognition of their (moderate) strength.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Hina has proven to be quite perceptive, as she was able to see through
Miss Goldenweek
's,
Mr. 5
's, and
Miss Valentine
's disguises by looking at their
wanted posters
.
She is a skilled
unarmed combatant
and was able, with the aid of her Devil Fruit, to defeat
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
, an extremely powerful hand-to-hand fighter, in a one-on-one battle on two separate occasions.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Ori Ori no Mi
The Ori Ori no Mi being used.
Hina ate the Ori Ori no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows her to create iron bars and create iron bindings on her opponents. This power earned her the nickname "Hina the Black Cage".
She can place restraints on people by swiping her limbs through them, as the victims passes through her body, the body part they pass through turns into an iron restraint, leaving them trapped in a ring of iron.
The body part she uses regenerates immediately.
She can also extend long iron cage bars from her body which she can use to strike at her opponents. These bars are able to wrap around and trap anyone who interacts with them, friend and foe alike. This allows Hina to bind multiple people at once.
Weapons
[
]
Although she has not been shown wielding any weapons, Hina has at her disposal the Black Cage Corps
(
黒檻部隊
,
Kuroori Butai
?
)
. So far only the "Black Cage Corps: Black Spear Squadron"
(
黒檻部隊 黒ヤリの陣
,
Kuroori Butai: Kuroyari no Jin
?
)
has been seen.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
In her youth, Hina trained as a
Marine cadet
alongside
Smoker
.
Though a model of obedience and professionalism, she remained friends with the defiant, disorderly Smoker, and on several occasions helped protect him from higher-ups.
Eventually, both reached the rank of
Captain
.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Jango's Dance Paradise
[
]
By pure coincidence, Hina passed by
"Ironfist" Fullbody
's unit shortly after Fullbody had sacrificed his
Lieutenant
rank to help exonerate the
Black Cat Pirates
' ex-
captain
Jango
. Though the two men had planned to part ways forever, they immediately became smitten with Hina after one glimpse, and instead applied to her unit as lowest-class seamen.
Still having a soft spot for unconventional personnel, Hina accepted.
Arabasta Arc
[
]
During the peak of
Arabasta
's civil war, Hina and her unit were summoned by Smoker to help investigate and quash
Baroque Works
operations along the kingdom's coast. In time, they captured the rainmaking
ship
Full
, a convoy for the illicit
Dance Powder
that agitated the war; when this coincided with sudden rain, Hina wondered aloud if Smoker had created it with the powder, but was repudiated. At his request (and after losing a coin toss), she prepared the Full and all other evidence of Baroque Works, including the defeated
Crocodile
, for transport to
Marine Headquarters
.
The following day, Hina received
Tashigi
and the rest of Smoker's unit at the port town of
Tamarisk
. Here, she witnessed Headquarters officials trying to bestow Smoker and Tashigi all credit for subduing Crocodile, and Smoker furiously protesting in favor of Arabasta's true saviors: the
Straw Hat Pirates
. Recognizing the
World Government
would never acknowledge
pirate
heroism, Hina urged Smoker to accept the honors and not defy his superiors, only for Smoker to loudly insult the entire cover-up.
In any case, the Marines were tasked with capturing the Straw Hats, as well as any remaining Baroque Works personnel. While Smoker's unit made little, if any effort toward this, Hina mobilized her Black Cage Corps and encircled the entire Arabasta coast. Her blockade, thirty ships strong, captured all but two fugitive ships: the Straw Hats'
Going Merry
and
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
's
Swanda Express
.
Allied together, the two crews charged Hina's blockade head-on, sustaining heavy damage from her Black Cage formation but managing to sink a key portion (coincidentally, the one carrying
Fullbody
and
Jango
). To Hina's surprise, only the Swanda Express used this opening. Seeing the Straw Hats onboard, she sent her remaining ships in pursuit, assuming the Merry was a decoy. Too late, she found these "Straw Hats" were Mr. 2's crew in disguise, supported by Mr. 2's
shapeshifting powers
; having resolved to sacrifice their ship and themselves for the Straw Hats' sake, Mr. 2 and his men proceeded to attack Hina's flagship.
Deeply irritated, Hina defeated the entire crew in single combat. While restraining the last of them with her powers, she reported the Straw Hats' escape to Smoker and dryly noted that he seemed to approve.

Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
[
]
Some time after his arrest, Mr. 2 managed to escape custody, and Hina and her unit resumed hunting for him as well as other Baroque Works fugitives. One of their main sites of interest was
Kyuka Island
, known to have hosted vacations for various agents.
Before long, Hina spotted
Miss Goldenweek
,
Mr. 5
, and
Miss Valentine
wandering the island in slipshod disguises.
Attacking, she easily captured
Miss Valentine
, but failed to stop the other two from escaping under cover of Mr. 5's
explosive powers
.
Undaunted, Hina arranged a public execution for Miss Valentine, announcing that she would only be spared if the other fugitives surrendered.
In time, Hina's ultimatum was met—by Mr. 2, once again using himself as a decoy to help his friends. Morphed into a "surrendering"
Mr. 3
, he ambushed Hina and her unit so Mr. 5 and Miss Goldenweek could rescue Miss Valentine. While the lower-ranked trio escaped (stealing one of her ships in the process), Hina successfully defeated and recaptured Mr. 2 in addition to the real Mr. 3.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
"Hina"
(
ひな
?
)
is an extant name for Japanese girls that corresponds to several different kanji. The most notable of these is
雛
, which may refer to:
A type of ornamental doll used as the focus (and namesake) of the
Hinamatsuri
"girl's day" festival
.
This tradition later expanded the term into a general diminutive prefix for "cute" things, reflecting the character's speech pattern (and popularity with male recruits).
A newborn or fledgling bird, following the series' trend of giving female characters bird-themed names.
The
4Kids-dubbed anime
, per standard policies, digitally erases her cigarette.
Early Concepts
[
]
An early sketch of "Ensign Marushiano".
Hina was originally intended to be called "Marushiano" (マルシアーノ). She also was supposed to have the rank of Ensign, rather than Captain. Although the character went through a name and rank change, the overall appearance remains the same. Furthermore, like how Fullbody is attracted to Hina, he was originally intended to be attracted to "Marushiano".
