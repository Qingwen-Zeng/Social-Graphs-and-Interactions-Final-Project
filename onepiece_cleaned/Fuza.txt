Abilities and Powers
[
]
Fuza breathing fire.
Fuza is a bird of such large proportions that it is enough to carry a full grown man on its back. Shura rides on Fuza in battle, giving them the advantage over earthbound opponents, as well as flying over the
Ordeal of String
, where wire traps lay to bind the opponent. Fuza can also breathe fire due to eating a
Flame Dial
, enhancing its master's fire-orientated techniques. This makes Fuza a living and flying flamethrower, allowing it to attack at virtually any angle with little restrictions, and the stream of flame seems to be quite long, making it a long-ranged combatant.
