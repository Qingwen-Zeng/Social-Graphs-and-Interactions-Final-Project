Lassoo
is
Mr. 4
's gun that consumed a
Devil Fruit
through some unknown method which allows it to become a living dog. He is classified as a Type D creature, "Small Savage".
Appearance
[
]
Lassoo is a sandy-brown gun, similar to a bazooka, that has handles on the sides and a contoured barrel.
Lassoo is always suffering from some kind of cold that makes him have a running nose and sneeze (which makes him fire cannonballs). It is unknown if this is an actual disease or a side-effect from being an inanimate gun unnaturally absorbing a devil-fruit.
Personality
[
]
He seems to be very loyal to his master, as he did everything he said without question.

Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Dachshund
Lassoo as a gun.
Being a gun that has absorbed a
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
, the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Dachshund, Lassoo can transform into a dachshund, becoming literally a gun-dog. In turn, Lassoo gains animal sentience and becomes a mobile mortar, increasing efficiency in combat. During battle, Lassoo functions as an automatic baseball pitching machine of sorts for his master to hit the baseball ammunition with towards their targets.
Cannonballs
[
]
On
Mr. 4
's call, Lassoo would cough up a seemingly infinite amount of exploding baseballs that (to Usopp's surprise) are not balls that explode on impact, but when a timer runs out. According to Chopper, Lassoo's baseballs are as heavy as cannonballs, thus ruining Chopper's plan to throw the ball back towards the agents before the baseball explodes. On the contrary, Mr. 4 can use his immense strength to strike these cannonballs with his 4-ton baseball bat, sending them flying at an incredible speed and accuracy at the opponents.
History

Arabasta Saga
[

Arabasta Arc
[
]
Lassoo teamed up with the Mr. 4 and
Miss Merry Christmas
team to fight
Usopp
and
Tony Tony Chopper
.
Lassoo was ultimately defeated when Usopp tricked Mr. 4 into slugging Miss Merry Christmas with his 4-ton bat. While Mr. 4 was shocked at what had just happened, Usopp took advantage of this time to fire a hammer at Mr. 4's gut using Chopper's horns as a slingshot. Mr. 4 then flew into Lassoo and hit a stone structure thus knocking them both out. Lasso coughed up one last exploding baseball that completely incapacitated the Mr. 4 team. Lassoo was then arrested by the
Marines
along with the rest of
Baroque Works
when
Crocodile
was defeated.
