Personality

]
He is described by
Gatz
as the "Colosseum's Grim Reaper", and his fighting style has led him to become known as the "Brutal Bull".
Despite this, Luffy was still able to tame and befriend him using his
Supreme King Haki
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
He is powerful enough to eliminate many competitors of C Block. He is also said to have eliminated many death row prisoners in the past, a further testament to his fighting prowess. However, he was no match for
Hajrudin
, as he was defeated in one blow by the
giant
.
Ucy has shown good strength and speed. Even with some injuries, he was able to easily carry
Luffy
,
Zoro,
Abdullah
and
Jeet
without tiring as he scaled Pica's massive golem before someone noticed.
In the anime, it is shown that his hide is thick enough to deflect sharp objects.
History

Past
[

At some point before his participation in C Block, he defeated many death row prisoners in the
Corrida Colosseum
.
Dressrosa Saga

Dressrosa Arc
[

The Brutal Bull entered the Corrida Colosseum to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
. For the battle royale, he was placed in C Block.
Ucy crushed by Hajrudin
During the battle royale, he was tamed and ridden by
Lucy
,
and was dubbed Ucy by the disguised Straw Hat captain. Charging into the midst of numerous combatants, he swiftly eliminated them, only to accidentally run into
Hajrudin
's leg. Taking this as a challenge, the giant attacked the two friends, smashing them both into the ground, which rendered Ucy unconscious and broke its left horn. Angered by the giant's attack on his newfound friend, Lucy avenged Ucy by knocking Hajrudin out with one blow.
He then carried Ucy away to a safer part of the ring.
He later went to the underground medical treatment facility to receive treatment for his injuries.
Ucy ridden by Luffy, Zoro, and Law and are accompanied by the other Corrida Colosseum fighters.
After Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his "birdcage", he went to the surface. After finding and recognizing Luffy, he joined forces with him alongside the
Chinjao Family
, Hajrudin,
Cavendish
,
Ideo
,
Elizabello II
,
Dagama
,
Blue Gilly
,
Abdullah
,
Jeet
,
Orlumbus
, and
Suleiman
. They later marched towards the palace and began to battle against
Pica
.
When Pica attempted to strike,
Chinjao
and Elizabello II shattered Pica's stone hand, enabling the group to move forward.
Pica then attacked with his other arm, causing Luffy's allies to fall back. However, Ucy, with Luffy,
Zoro
,
Law
, Abdullah, and Jeet on its back, jumped on and ran on Pica's arm. After Luffy shattered Pica's stone head with Grizzly Magnum, Pica's true body appeared before the bull. Pica took out his sword and tried to attack the bull and the group riding on it, but Luffy carried the bull and evaded the sword strike. Zoro intercepted Pica when he attempted to strike again. With Pica held back, Ucy ran on the stone giant's back, carrying Luffy, Law, Abdullah, and Jeet closer to the palace.
They eventually reached the first level of the new King's Plateau. While they charged through Doflamingo's troops,
Kelly Funk
(while
fused
to
Bobby Funk
) appeared, seemingly to aid them and showed them a tunnel that is supposed to go directly to the fourth level. While entering the tunnel, Abdullah and Jeet fell off Ucy so he, Luffy, and Law went ahead without them. Instead of reaching the fourth level, they reached a dead end where they found themselves above a pool of water. They were then ambushed by
Doflamingo
.
Doflamingo attacked Ucy with a bullet thread, knocking him unconscious. Ucy, Luffy, and Law were saved from death by the timely arrival of Abdullah and Jeet, who both struck Doflamingo (who was only a string clone) in the back. After Luffy punched a hole to the second level, he left Ucy with Abdullah and Jeet.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, "Brutal Bull" has been used as the character's name, rather than as an epithet. "Fighting bull" has only been used to describe him, just as "fighting lion" describes
Agyo
.
The name was mistakenly romanized as "Brutal Bule" when the gladiators were introduced at the beginning of C Block.
