Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Joshu
is derived from the Japanese word 助手
(
joshu
?
)
, which means "assistant."
In the
VIZ
version of
Chapter 1065
, a line was added in which
Edison
called Joshu "Assis-Tabby". In the Japanese version, Edison says "猫の手も 借りたい"
(
neko no te mo karitai
?
, lit. "to want to borrow even the paw of a cat")
, an idiom referring to there not being enough time in the day. To explain this, VIZ treats Assis-Tabby as a title
when Joshu is named
, calling him "Josh the Assis-Tabby".
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, a similar series of events - Edison coming up with an idea, saying he would even accept a cat's help, and Joshu following him to help - plays out again, implying that Joshu frequently has to insert itself into Edison's spur-of-the-moment design processes.
