Pythagoras
, also designated as
Punk-04
(
PUNK-04
,
Panku-Fō

)
, is one of the six satellites of Dr.
Vegapunk
, embodying his aspect of "wisdom".
He is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Egghead Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Pythagoras is a large mechanical being. His head was a sphere with a turn-key protruding from the top and a space in the front containing his eyes which always appeared drowsy; his head could detach from the main body and move independently with a set of retractable arms and legs. Pythagoras' main body was metallic, with the top part being red and the bottom cream. His designation, Punk-04, was printed on his left breast and the kanji for "wisdom"
(
知
?
)
was printed on the center of its chest. His arms, hands, and legs were composed of bendable metal rods.
After his original body's destruction, Pythagoras survived by reconvening into Edison's body, who reconstructed the combined Vegapunk with Edison's head, Atlas's left arm, Pythagoras's right arm, and Shaka's torso and legs.
Personality
[
]
Being Vegapunk's "wisdom" satellite, Pythagoras has shown to be calm and highly interested in observing the performances of Vegapunk's inventions. He is devoted to recording data from these tests and examining the potential scientific implications and can grow very excited when situations arise that provide exceptional data.
Pythagoras also tends to resort to peaceful solutions, as he was trying to reason with the CP0 agents that were sent to kill Vegapunk and his satellites, trying to create excuses for them not to land on Egghead. He even advised Lilith not to make things worse when she got angry at their repeated requests for permission to dock, knowing impulsive reactions could lead to them just coming to the island anyway.
In addition, he also tended to keep good relations between the satellites as he was consistently trying to mediate between Lilith and Shaka, when they were arguing about CP0's breach into the Labophase and if they should respond peacefully or violently. But even outside of conflicts, Pythagoras always tries to keep his fellow satellites safe. When Vegapunk was recording a message about the truth of the world alongside Shaka and Pythagoras, Pythagoras  always worries about Vegapunk burning his tongue on a Vegacoffee and scolding Shaka for purposefully letting it happen, seemingly being seriously worried about Vegapunk burning his tongue.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being a satellite of Vegapunk, Pythagoras has been a contributor to the genius scientist's numerous technological developments.
Pythagoras is extremely intelligent, being capable of drawing a large number of theories and conclusions just by witnessing Vegapunk's inventions in action; when observing one of the
Seraphim
in combat, Pythagoras quickly made observations regarding potential
Lineage Factor
traits. It also seems to be part of Pythagoras' duties to compile and analyze data.
History

Past
[
]
During a visit to
Mary Geoise
, either in person or as a memory of Vegapunk, Pythagoras experienced the cruelty of the
World Nobles
.
When Pythagoras,
Shaka
, and Stella discovered odd discrepancies in the
Mother Flame
's energy output, Shaka deduced that the culprit logically must be one of the Vegapunks, and that the three of them were the only ones that had alibis. The three concluded that they would have to continue observing in order to get more information. One week later, Pythagoras revealed that he had discovered the culprit to be
York
, citing that her memories uploaded to
Punk Records
were invalid, and that the
Den Den Mushi
recordings of the Mother Flame room were tampered with. Pythagoras also stated that he had discovered a
White Den Den Mushi
, leading to the conclusion that York had been hiding her transmissions. A day later, the
Lulusia Kingdom
was obliterated through what Vegapunk assumed was an
Ancient Weapon
, and he had Pythagoras monitor changes in the sea level and any transmissions leaving
Egghead
. Shaka suggested fleeing the island, but Vegapunk reminded him of the
World Government
's influence over the entire planet, and that escape would be impossible. When Vegapunk explained that their deaths were immanent and likely necessary, Shaka and Pythagoras fearlessly stated their intentions to join him in his plan to reveal their knowledge on the
Void Century
to the world.
Shaka, Pythagoras, and Vegapunk prepare to erase their memories.
A few days later, Pythagoras assisted Vegapunk in his recording. Realizing that their behaviors would be perceived as strange by the other Vegapunks, the trio decided the best course of action would be to erase their memories, in order to ensure their plans would remain undiscovered. After doing so, the three read a message Vegapunk had written just prior to them, and were naturally shocked by the overload of information that they had just forgotten being revealed once again in such a short time.
Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
When some of the
Straw Hat Pirates
entered Vegapunk's laboratory, they were attacked by the
Seraphim
S-Shark
and Pythagoras watched S-Shark's performance, constantly analyzing and evaluating the Seraphim's performance as well as the battle's progress, alongside
Lilith
and
Edison
before
Shaka
arrived to stop it.
When
CP0
requested permission to dock at Egghead, Pythagoras promptly went to Shaka, fearing that the World Government agents would find out about the pirates on their island and as a possible result, the following punishment by the World Government. Lilith offered to simply hand over the pirates, but Shaka ordered the agents to be denied landing and prepare for battle because the government agents would not simply accept the refusal.
Pythagoras tried to reason with the group, stating that their delivery of
S-Bear
would be appreciated but they could not let them dock, knowing fully well that they were there to kill them, even advising Lilith not to make things work by provoking them. He later watched the
Sea Beast Weapons
devour their ship, concluding they must have used the Seraphim's powers to reach the island.
After CP0 had been subdued, Pythagoras went to look for the missing Vegapunk Stella on Shaka's orders. While he was searching for the Stella, Pythagoras was approached from behind by
S-Snake
, and an explosion went off in the laboratory,
which he survived by detaching his head from his body. He then met up with
Usopp
,
Franky
, Lilith, and
York
who went there to investigate the explosion. Usopp aimed at him, so Pythagoras explained to them that he is his head. Before he can say that S-Snake is an enemy, he witnessed her turn York
into stone.
S-Snake then fires a beam at them, throwing them off the platform. Lilith held Pythagoras and used her DOM shoes to land safely. Pythagoras panicked when Lilith was unable to contact Shaka.
S-Snake crushes Pythagoras, destroying his body.
The four managed to get back on the platform. Pythagoras praised Lilith for weakening S-Snake using a Bubble Gun. In response, S-Snake fires another beam at them, but they managed to dodge it.
After S-Snake petrified the three, Pythagoras got mad and asked her why she did it and who ordered her, but she just stepped on his head and caused it to explode.
Although his body was destroyed, Pythagoras survived, and reconvened into Edison's body alongside Shaka and Atlas.
