Personality
[
]
Amande is very stoic and cold, always appearing to be reserved and quiet. She does not seem to show or express any emotion, but she can be expressive verbally.
Amande is very loyal to
her mother
and will execute any mission she is given, with no qualms about killing enemies.
She seems to be highly ruthless and sadistic at the same time, as she claims there is no meaning in slaughter without grievously tormenting the victim first as shown when she sliced through
Kingbaum
, in doing so she wanted to make sure that his death would be long and agonizing, even though he tried to explain himself of his powerlessness against the Straw Hats.
She appears to hold care for the island she governs,
Nuts Island
, as she tried to stop Big Mom from destroying it. Amande even showed concern for her family as when Brûlée called out to her for help, she tried to save her.

sent Amande to an island decorated with very large eggs in order to gather eggs for the wedding cake. Amande succeeded in obtaining them after massacring several knights guarding them.

Two days later, Amande was on
Whole Cake Island
. After
Monkey D. Luffy
defeated Sweet Commander
Charlotte Cracker
, Amande and
an army
marched towards Luffy's location and began battling him.
During the battle, Amande punished the
homie
Kingbaum
for serving the
Straw Hat Pirates
by bisecting him vertically, making sure to make his death as slow as possible. After finishing Baum off, Amande removed
Nami
's
Vivre Card
and saw that it was from
Lola
. The army then returned to Sweet City with the captive Straw Hats in tow.
Later, Amande attended a meeting to go over the statuses of the Sanji Retrieval Team and the
Vinsmoke Family
.
She attended Big Mom's
Tea Party
and wedding ceremony for Pudding and Sanji. After Luffy started causing chaos at the wedding venue, Amande witnessed
Jinbe
officially resigning from the Big Mom Pirates.
While the Straw Hats and
Fire Tank Pirates
were hiding inside
Bege
's
fortress
after the failed assassination attempt on Big Mom, Amande commented that if the fortress were destroyed, everyone inside would be thrown out. As Big Mom assaulted the fortress, the Big Mom Pirates prepared to attack anyone who left it. Just when Luffy's group, Bege's crew, and the Vinsmokes were routed by the Big Mom Pirates,
the
Tamatebako
dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and exploded, causing the castle to topple over.
As the castle collapsed, Amande fell with it. However, the Big Mom Pirates were saved when

used
his ability
to turn the falling castle into cake.
As the Straw Hats were preparing to escape from Whole Cake Island, Amande's Tarteship was among the fleet of Tarteships surrounding the
Thousand Sunny
.
She later witnessed the Thousand Sunny using a Coup De Burst to fly away and then reported the ship's escape.
Amande later went to Nuts Island, trying to dissuade Big Mom from destroying the island. She was then surprised to find Luffy, who just exited the
Mirro-World
with Brûlée. As Big Mom began pursuing Luffy, Amande tried to attack him, but Luffy dodged the strike.
Amande remained on the island after Big Mom left it in ruins. She listened as the citizens questioned their way of life under Big Mom's "protection".
