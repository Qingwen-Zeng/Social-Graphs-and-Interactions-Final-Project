Fish-Man Island Arc

In
Mermaid Cove
, Mero and her friends welcomed the
Straw Hat Pirates
when
Camie
brought them there for a visit. Seeing them, Mero commented that they did not appear very frightening.
When the three princes arrived to inquire about the crew's illegal entry into
Fish-Man Island
, the mermaids denied the crew was there, hiding them. However, when the crew's presence was made known anyways by
Sanji
's nosebleed and
Hammond
's attack, the princes made it clear that they were simply trying to deliver
Jinbe
's message to
Monkey D. Luffy
.
After
Ishilly
,
Fillonce
, and another mermaid were kidnapped by
Caribou
, Mero and the others wondered where they went off to and they had no clue of what had happened to them. The only thing they did know was that Ishilly was opening a barrel.
