Appearance
[
]
Joseph's concept art from the anime.
Joseph is a tall, lanky agent. He appears to have double-jointed elbows, making him part of the
Longarm Tribe
. He wears a light colored mask with dark streaks running down its right side, darkened lips and nose, and framed with petal-like adornments. He also sports a vertically striped red and white top hat. Like most CP0 members, he wears a white suit and cape (a frilly one in his case).
Personality
[
]
Like most of CP0's agents, Joseph is professional and prioritizes his missions above all else.
In spite of his emotionless disposition, Joseph appears to care for his fellow CP0 agents to an extent, having silently acknowledged and mourned the sacrifice of one of his peers.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Joseph's overall abilities remain mostly unseen. However, the fact he wears a mask puts him among the top operatives of CP0, according to
Nico Robin
.
He appeared to be completely unharmed after being shot in the head by Kurozumi Orochi.
Rokushiki
[

Main article:
Rokushiki
Being an agent of CP0, the elite
Cipher Pol

Geppo
, which he used to escape from
Onigashima
.
History

]
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
The CP0 agents address the citizens of Dressrosa.
The
CP0
agents Joseph,
Guernika
, and
Gismonda
traveled to
Dressrosa
in order to dismiss the previously reported revocation of
Donquixote Doflamingo
from the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
as a printing mistake to the country's population. They also insisted that the citizens remain quiet about this until the new report was published.
The three agents later wandered around the island and were spotted by
Nico Robin
,
Trafalgar Law
,
Caesar Clown
, and
Usopp
.

Wano Country Arc
[
]
In the
Flower Capital
, Joseph, Guernika, and
Maha
negotiated with
Shogun
Kurozumi Orochi
about the new supply of weapons to the
World Government
after the arrest of
Donquixote Doflamingo
. Due to Orochi's surreal demands, CP0 was unable to agree to his terms.
The CP0 agents monitor the raid on Onigashima.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, the three agents stayed in
Onigashima
's guest room and used a
Go board
to track the forces during the
raid on Onigashima
, with Joseph in particular praising the planning and execution of the raid from the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
.
Joseph also discussed
Who's-Who's
situation as a former
Cipher Pol
agent and how they should deal with him, although he did not think there was much harm in Who's-Who's survival due to his classified intel being relatively outdated.
After hearing about the events of the battle that took place and seeing how little by little the numbers of the rebels were assimilating those of their enemies, the agents received priority orders through
Rob Lucci
to capture
Nico Robin
,
with Joseph staying behind to keep tabs on the raid as the other two went after her.
After Guernika and Maha lost sight of Robin, Joseph called and informed them about the great defeats produced on
Kaidou
's side, as well as the massive implications that a loss from the
Four Emperors
would mean to the current state of the world.
Later, after
Izou
confronted the two field CP0 agents, Joseph once more called Guernika and informed him about the new directives from the
Five Elders
to interfere in
Luffy
and Kaidou's fight in order to prevent a certain
awakening
from occurring, acknowledging that it was essentially a suicide mission that his partner had to take.
Once Guernika completed his objective to sabotage Luffy and brutally attacked by Kaidou, Joseph silently mourned him.
Joseph escapes Onigashima.
Using
Geppo
, Joseph eventually escaped from Onigashima
and regrouped with the World Government fleet that was stationed right outside Wano. He contacted the Five Elders and informed them about the return of
Nika
, assuring his superiors that he would capture Nico Robin as previously ordered to. After that,
Admiral
Ryokugyu
hijacked the call and ordered Joseph and the fleet to remain in position until he arrived.
Joseph's contact with the Five Elders was eventually cut off due to a confrontation with the
Big Mom Pirates
.
