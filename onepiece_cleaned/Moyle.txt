Moyle was a member of the Divine Squad and, when Enel invaded the island, tried to defend his leader's title. After their loss, he was torn away from his family and forced by Enel into his army as a prisoner to build the ark
Maxim
for six years.
After its completion, he was betrayed by being left close to death until
Conis
and
Pagaya
found him. After finding him, he told them about Enel's plan, which was to reset everything by making Skypiea fall back into the Blue Sea and wiping out all citizens then leaving on his Ark Maxim.
He was then struck by a bolt of lighting.
What happened to him after this is unknown. His son,
Mochi
, later talked about how he wanted to see his father since they never met but was proud of him for working with the god, who he thought was good.
