Appearance

Loki's silhouette when he proposed to Lola.
Loki is a very large
giant
with long, light hair arranged in twin braids at the front, but disheveled at the back. His body is relatively lanky by giant standards, with long legs and muscular tattooed arms. He also sports a pointy goatee, a metallic shell over his nose and tends to leave his tongue hanging out while speaking.
Like most giants from
Elbaph
, Loki dresses in Viking-like fashion, including a dark, wide-rimmed helmet with a pair of long horns extending upwards (the leftmost one tied in place by a wrapping), as well as a dark ensemble of gloves, pants, boots and a belt sporting a crowned
Jolly Roger
design worn over his abdomen. Loki also has his eyes covered in bandages, but it is unknown if this is by choice or as part of his punishment.
When Loki proposed to Lola, his outfit consisted of a tall crown, a tunic, and a cape.
Personality
[
]
Loki is considered by the residents of
Elbaph
to be a wicked and dangerous man, having committed numerous deplorable acts, none more infamous than the murder of his father, the
king
, for the sole purpose of obtaining a
Devil Fruit
because he desired it desperately. Loki is violent, insane, and destructive, as he wishes to bring about the end of the
world
.
Normally, Loki is jovial and constantly smiling, but also tends to be impatient and easily irritated.
Befitting his namesake, Loki is a deceptive manipulator, having an interest in making deals that he may or may not honor and provoking others in order to elicit a reaction, all while brushing it off as a joke when met with retaliation. He is also immensely arrogant, proclaiming himself the strongest being in
Elbaph
, and does not tolerate others speaking in his presence without permission.
Being an extremely proud giant, Loki generally has little respect for humans, insulting even those who follow him, and has trouble recalling their names, much like how
Luffy
sometimes does to other people. He is, however, good with animals, having befriended the wild beasts of Elbaph as a child and relying on them as a way to threaten others into compliance.

As the
prince
of
Elbaph
, Loki was once a deeply respected individual within the kingdom of
giants
. His birth was toasted for during the
Winter Solstice Festival
.
He had the privilege to propose to the
23rd daughter
of
Charlotte Linlin
, a person most hated by the entire
race
of giants. Despite their hatred of Linlin, his subjects certainly seemed to support him full-heartedly when he confessed his love to Lola, and Linlin believed that had the
marriage
been successful, their resentment would fade out of respect for Loki. Consequently, when Lola escaped and Linlin attempted to pass off her twin
Chiffon
as a replacement, the giants' respect for Loki caused them to further detest Linlin for offending him.
Currently, however, Loki is no longer held in high regards by his people due to murdering his father,
King
Harald
, earning himself nothing but scorn and fear in his own homeland, to the point of being considered Elbaph's greatest shame as a result. For his crimes, Loki was sentenced to crucifixion, with Elbaph's strongest warriors having to stay on high alert in order to prevent his escape.
Lola

Loki proposes to Lola.
Loki fell in love with
Charlotte Lola
at first sight. Despite her being the daughter of
Charlotte Linlin
, a figure hated among the giants, he proposed to her, and successfully arranged a political marriage. However, Lola did not reciprocate the prince's feelings, and ran away in order to find her own true love. Loki's love for Lola is more than simply based on her appearance, as he was unwilling to marry
Chiffon
in her stead.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Luffy appears to greatly annoy Loki, as the former's excitable and unpredictable nature tends to blindside his own attempts at manipulative threats. Loki has attempted to convince and even enforce Luffy into freeing him, with little success. From his inner thoughts, it is clear that Loki wants to murder Luffy with his own hands, showing no interest in honoring the deal he had himself proposed beforehand.
That said, Loki was quickly able to figure out that Luffy has a connection with
Shanks
, swiftly using that information to his advantage in order to gain Luffy's full attention. Despite Loki's inability to fight back, Luffy reacted with extreme aggression when the giant prince started insulting Shanks, losing his usual happy-go-lucky attitude that he had until then and reprimanding Loki for "joking" at Shanks' expense.
Shanks
[
]
Loki appears to be familiar with
Shanks
, but the nature of their relationship is still a mystery. Loki has described Shanks as a "coward", although it is likely that he was only doing so to rile Luffy up.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Loki is extremely powerful even among the
giants
, being noted to have required all of
Elbaph
's finest warriors to keep him in check even while imprisoned.
He considers himself to be the strongest warrior in all of Elbaph and many giants believe that Loki has enough power to destroy the
world
should he ever be freed once again.
As acknowledgement of his capabilities, the
World Government
has issued a special bounty of
2,600,000,000 on Loki, although the specifics behind why that bounty is considered "special" to begin with is currently unknown.
As prince of Elbaph, he previously held significant authority and influence over the warriors and citizens of Elbaph, which is said to be the strongest kingdom in the entire world;
this included the privilege of proposing to the
23rd daughter
of
Big Mom
, who was deeply hated by the giants, and the influence to end their resentment, had the marriage been successful. Inversely, anything that slighted Loki prompted hatred from the giants, as evidenced by Big Mom's failed attempt to trick him.
Following his sentencing as a criminal and subsequent punishment, however, Loki does not appear to hold royal privileges anymore.
Still, in spite of his current predicament, Loki has retained influence over a small group of loyal
humans
, as well as a number of wild beasts that he claims to have befriended in his childhood. This allows Loki to still threaten anyone into cooperating, assuming they manage to survive long enough in Elbaph's Underworld to meet him.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Loki's endurance in particular appears to be phenomenal, as he has been chained in
seastone
for nearly six years, yet has not succumbed to the freezing climate of Elbaph's Underworld and even managed to almost escape at one point. Also, Loki has impressive reaction speed and is capable of dodging an incoming
Gear Fourth
strike at point-blank range while bound and blindfolded. It is unknown if this is by pure reflex or use of
Observation Haki
.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Loki has eaten an unnamed
Devil Fruit
. Its type and powers are currently unknown, but it is purportedly a legendary fruit that he greatly desired to possess to the point of murdering his own father.
Weapons
[
]
Loki appears have equipped himself with a large hammer of some sort, despite his imprisonment.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Loki was born on
Elbaph
63 years ago, about ten months after a 5-year-old
Charlotte Linlin
was left on the island by her parents.
When he was a child, Loki spent time with the monsters of the Underworld and formed a friendly relationship with them.
Years later, Loki encountered the 23rd daughter of the
Charlotte Family
,
Charlotte Lola
, whom he fell in love with at first sight. In an attempt to fix her strained relationship with the giants, Lola's mother Linlin arranged a marriage between them, but Lola ran away due to wanting to marry someone she truly loved. Wanting the marriage to go on anyways, Big Mom tried replacing her with her twin
Chiffon
, but the giants realized the trick and the wedding was annulled, further increasing the enmity between the two sides.
Sometime later, Loki set his sights on a legendary
Devil Fruit
that was passed down along generations of the
royal
family. This put him in conflict with his father and then
king
of Elbaph,
Harald
, leading Loki to kill him in order to obtain the fruit for himself and eat it. Loki, however, was captured by Elbaph's military and sentenced to crucifixion afterwards. Loki almost managed to free himself at first, but Elbaph's strongest giants were able to work together to hold him down and prevent his escape for the time being by wrapping him in
seastone
chains across
Treasure Tree Adam
in the Underworld six years ago.
During his time chained to the tree, Loki amassed a group of human followers who had also been sent to the Underworld, and continued his amicable relationship with the beasts. At one point,
Shanks
came to Loki and knocked out his followers with
Supreme King Haki
.
The exact details of his interaction with Shanks have yet to be revealed.
Final Saga
[

Elbaph Arc
[
]
While
Luffy
and his
crewmates
escaped the
Land of Gods
, he
sensed
a powerful, intimidating presence somewhere within Elbaph's mountains and went on to check it himself. Said presence ended up being a chained Loki, who demanded Luffy's name before introducing himself.
Loki is attacked by Luffy after insulting Shanks.
After a less than pleasant first impression of the Straw Hat captain, Loki attempted to bargain with Luffy for his freedom, promising to destroy any rival pirate crew in exchange. To further ensure that this "deal" would be achieved, Loki had some of his human followers and giants beasts show up to coerce him into action, but Luffy ended up foiling this plan by taming the beasts himself. However, perceiving that Luffy shared a personal connection with Shanks after his subordinates namedropped the latter, Loki was able to catch Luffy's anger and then his full attention after insulting the red-haired pirate. With Luffy showing further curiosity over Shanks' whereabouts, Loki proposed another deal.
