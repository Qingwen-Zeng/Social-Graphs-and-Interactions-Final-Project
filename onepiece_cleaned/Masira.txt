"Salvage King" Masira
is the
boss
(
園長
,
bosu
?
)
of the
Masira Pirates
and the head of a simian ship salvage operation near
Jaya
Island. His sworn brother is
Shoujou
and both of them are members of the
Saruyama Alliance
, headed by
Mont Blanc Cricket
. He and Shoujou are both fans of
Mont Blanc Noland
's exploits and the
fairy tale book
based on them.
He became an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Jaya Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Masira is a human with ape-like features, he wears an orange-yellow jumpsuit, and also has headphones and goggles. What makes him interesting is he apparently has a tail, although sometimes it cannot be seen. An example of when it clearly can be seen is when
Bellamy
first tackles him from behind, during the
Bellamy Pirates
vs.
Saruyama Alliance
fight, or when he is carrying wood to fix the
Going Merry
. Masira also has huge arms and some kind of piercing around his wrists.
After the timeskip he no longer wears the jumpsuit, but has a shirt with the same design on the front. Other than this he looks the same as before.
Personality
[
]
Masira often acts very serious, but is very silly and not very bright in reality. He is easily angered, notably most of all, by the idea of someone stealing his salvage operations,
yet at the same time has a rather friendly disposition, especially if someone shows interest in his salvaging skills (putting a lot of effort to impress observers) or calls him a monkey. He is easily won over with friendship along with his brother when the
Straw Hats
appear at their home on Jaya Island.
Like his brother, he is protective of
Cricket
who they have come to know as a father figure. He and his fellow Alliance members displayed a amazing spirit to get back up and continue their modifications to the
Going Merry
after Bellamy's attacks. On their last encounter with the Straw Hats, all sides left on good terms.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Masira is immensely strong, being capable of knocking out a gigantic eel with merely a punch while underwater.
Masira has amazing lung capacity, being able to blow a giant air bubble in nearly a single breath, which was enough air to raise an entire sunken ship from the seafloor. He is also an excellent diver and has great knowledge of how to recover shipwrecks from the sea bottom, befitting his epithet as "Salvage King".

Going Merry
and is quickly kicked off.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
"Mas(h)ira"
is an older, less-common pronunciation of the kanji for
monkey
(
猿
?
)
, which is generally pronounced
"saru"
in modern Japanese.
The kanji in his title of "boss"
(
園長
,
bosu
?
)
literally means "zoo director", playing into his monkey theme.
