When the
World Government
had ordered to eliminate
Vegapunk
, Urban, alongside
Jaygarcia Saturn
,
Kizaru
, and eight other
Vice Admirals
, led a Marine fleet to besiege the island of
Egghead
.
After Kizaru had infiltrated Egghead, the Marines managed to make landfall at the island. Shortly after, Urban and
Doll
felt the presence of Saturn arriving on the island.
As Saturn had caught
Jewelry Bonney
in his reach, the Marines prepared to execute her,
but the squad was wiped out by
Bartholomew Kuma
.
Saturn then ordered a
Buster Call
on Egghead, prompting the Marines to evacuate.
During the attack, the
Pacifista
under Bonney's command were attacking the ships. Soon after
Tosa
reported he would attempt to kill Bonney to retrieve control of the Pacifista, Urban noticed they had lost further contact with him after he was defeated by
Brogy
.
