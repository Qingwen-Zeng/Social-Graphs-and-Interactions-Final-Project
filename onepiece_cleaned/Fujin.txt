History

Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After seeing the geisha
O-Robi
suspiciously sneaking around Orochi Castle during
Orochi
's banquet, Fujin and the rest of the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
snuck up and cornered her.
The ninjas questioned who she was and then moved to capture her, but unbeknownst to them, it was her
body double
, and so when they caught her, she vanished into thin air. Seeing this, they broke off into the banquet hall to find the real body of the geisha.
While searching, Fujin and
Raijin
encountered
Brook
's spirit form, and ran screaming for their lives, while mistaking him for the
Gashadokuro
. As they ran, they encountered their comrades and shouted that a ghost was chasing them, which led to their comrades running away in fear as well.
As the
Straw Hat Pirates
were causing chaos at Rasetsu Town after
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution,
Daikoku
ordered Fujin and Raijin to pursue a
woman
that was seen with
Roronoa Zoro
. As they were about to capture her, Zoro came and attacked Raijin.
Zoro defeats Fujin.
After Zoro and Hiyori fled to the forest outside the capital, Fujin led a group of ninjas in pursuit of the duo and the entire group was eventually defeated by Zoro.
