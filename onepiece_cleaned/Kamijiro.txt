Kamijiro
is a lion's head, legs, and tail that are attached to
Holed'em
's body due to his consumption of a lion
SMILE
.
Appearance
[
]
Kamijiro's entire body consists only of a lion's head, two legs, and a tail growing from Holed'em's stomach. His mane is striped and circular. The tuft of his tail is also striped and is about the size of his head.
Personality
[
]
Kamijiro has a mind of his own, allowing him to act independently of Holed'em. Much like Holed'em, though, he is very violent and quick to anger. However, his rage can sometimes make him act rashly and attack Holed'em himself. It is implied by Holed'em's subordinates that Kamijiro is not very intelligent, given that he does not seem to realize that he and Holed'em share the same body, and thus each other's pain.
Relationships

Holed'em
[
]
Kamijiro shares a body with Holed'em after the latter consumed a
SMILE
Devil Fruit, and so the two normally act in tandem. Kamijiro usually obeys Holed'em's commands during battle and when dealing with enemies. However, the two's similar personalities can cause them to sometimes get annoyed with and attack each other, even though they share the same body.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Though he is limited by only going where Holed'em goes, Kamijiro possesses tremendous strength that assists Holed'em greatly in battle. His legs appear to be quite powerful, as shown when he swiped Holed'em in the groin and caused both of them great pain.
His jaw is also extremely strong, as Holed'em stated that he could crush and tear apart
Tama
easily with it.

History
[
]
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Holed'em
had a young girl named
Tama
brought to his headquarters. When Kamijiro glared at him, Holed'em hit the lion's head, so Kamijiro retaliated by hitting Holed'em in the groin. This hurt the lion as well since they shared the same body.
Kamijiro holds Tama.
Later, Holed'em's house was destroyed when
Monkey D. Luffy
sent the yokozuna
Urashima
flying into it, and Kamijiro held Tama in his mouth as Holed'em confronted Luffy. Holed'em threatened to have Kamijiro crush Tama in his jaws if Luffy moved,
but Luffy moved and hit Kamijiro in the blink of an eye as he freed Tama from his grasp. Luffy then turned around to attack Holed'em, who had Kamijiro breathe fire at him. However, Luffy emerged from the flames unharmed and punched Holed'em in the face, defeating him.
Kamijiro remained conscious as Holed'em laid unconscious on the ground.
When Holed'em woke up later, both Kamijiro and Holed'em saw
Kaidou
in
Kuri
and shook in fear before witnessing the complete destruction of Oden Castle.
On the day of
Komurasaki
's funeral, Kamijiro growled as Holed'em ordered his men to turn on the
Picture Tanishi
to watch a broadcast.
Both later watched the broadcast of
Yasuie
's execution.
