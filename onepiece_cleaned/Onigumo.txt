Vice Admiral Onigumo
is a
Marine
officer, and one of the five
vice admirals
who led the
Buster Call
on
Enies Lobby
.
His name was revealed in the
third databook
.
Appearance
[
]
Onigumo is a tall man with a cold face and eyes that are always semi-closed. He is usually seen smoking a cigarette, has long brown hair, and wears an ancient war helmet with a small, traditional Japanese dragon on it, and a long red plume hanging from it. Under his Marine coat he wears a double-breasted gray suit over a dark green shirt with a silver tie. He also has a golden loop earring on his left ear.
Personality
[
]
Onigumo shoots a Marine for questioning orders.
Onigumo is a firm believer of the
Absolute Justice
philosophy, and is willing to sacrifice anything to defeat what is defined as "evil". This was shown when a soldier questioned Onigumo's order of destroying a fellow Buster Call ship and one thousand comrades just to kill
Monkey D. Luffy
, which led Onigumo to shoot him in cold blood.
In the anime, his dedication to Absolute Justice is further shown at Marineford, when he gave a charismatic speech to other Marines telling them that their victory in the pursuit for justice must be absolute.
Despite his calm exterior at such moments, he is capable of rage and shock, as when the Buster Call failed, and when
Monkey D. Garp
was seemingly defeated by
his grandson
, respectively.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a Marine vice admiral, Onigumo is capable of commanding a Buster Call alongside four other vice admirals.
He had enough stealth and speed to pin down
Marco
and clasp a
Seastone
-cuff onto his wrist.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Onigumo possesses a currently unknown
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a spider. Using this power he is able to grow three pairs of spider-like black arms from his hair, as well as a spider-like abdomen. With these spider-like appendages and his own two human arms, he is capable of wielding a total of eight sabers in a similar fashion to
Hatchan
's
Six Sword Style
and
Hyouzou
's
Eight Sword Style
.
These spider-like arms seem to be produced from his elongated hair.

Weapons
[
]
Unlike most other vice admirals, Onigumo seems to prefer
sabers
, rather than katanas. Using both of his hands and with the aid of his six spider-like appendages, he's capable of wielding eight sabers at the same time with extreme skill and deadly precision. He was also seen wielding a pistol to shoot one of his subordinates for questioning the doctrine of "
Absolute Justice
".
Haki

Haki
It was stated that all vice admirals possess
Haki
,
so Onigumo can also use the ability.
History
[
]
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Onigumo at Enies Lobby.
Onigumo, along with four other vice admirals, were summoned to Enies Lobby at the command of the Buster Call.
He was the one who commanded three ships to attack a fellow Marine ship with all its one thousand fellow sailors on board just to target
Monkey D. Luffy
, who was fighting on it with
Rob Lucci
, though he had confidence that Lucci would survive. Onigumo also shot one of his own soldiers who spoke out against the idea of sacrificing a thousand comrades to take down Luffy, enforcing his views on "Absolute Justice".
When the Marine ships fell into disarray due to the whirlpools that formed after the Gates of Justice closed, Onigumo was seen shouting insults at the personnel of the gates for closing it (though in reality it was closed up by
Sanji
).
Summit War Saga
[
]
Impel Down Arc
[
]
He was waiting to transfer Ace to Marineford, and told his squad not to let their guard down for a second during the procedure, then he told Ace to take a final look at the sky since he would no longer be able to do so once he arrived in Marineford for his execution.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Onigumo detains Marco.
He was seen holding eight swords along with his fellow vice admirals preparing to battle the
Whitebeard Pirates
and their allies. When the battle began, he was shown cutting down the Whitebeard Pirates with little effort.
During the war he attacked First Division Captain
Marco
, slapping
Seastone
handcuffs around one of his wrists, in order to disable Marco's Devil Fruit-based regenerative abilities giving
Admiral
Kizaru
an opening to shoot him.
Onigumo was later seen shocked when
Monkey D. Garp
fell to his grandson,
Monkey D. Luffy
. After the death of
Whitebeard
and the arrival of
Shanks
, he stood down upon order from
Fleet Admiral
Sengoku
.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime during the
Summit War of Marineford
, after the death of Ace and Whitebeard, Onigumo was seen giving a speech to lower ranking soldiers on how they should seize this momentum they are gaining by pursuing the escaping pirates, to show the world "justice" and to ensure that no more pirates will dare rise after this victory if the Marines can show how merciless they can be towards evil. In an ironic sense, this made said marines that followed this speech appear evil.
