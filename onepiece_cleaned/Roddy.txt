as demonstrated when he attacked

He also has the tendency to say "moo" while speaking.

Sulong
transformation.

History

Past
[
]
When the
Beasts Pirates
, led by
Jack
, invaded
Zou
in search of
Raizo
, Roddy and the other
Guardians
fought against them.
The battle against the Beast Pirates lasted for five days. On the fifth day of the battle, Jack lost his patience and unleashed
Caesar Clown
's
Koro
gas, which left the
minks
poisoned and drastically weakened. The following day, Jack left Zou after hearing about
Donquixote Doflamingo
's defeat and capture,
and the minks were later saved when
Sanji
and his group came to Zou.
When Sanji was taken away from Zou by
Capone Bege
after giving his crewmates the opportunity to escape, Roddy released the chains restraining
Tony Tony Chopper
.
Zou Arc

Roddy clashes with Luffy.
When
Monkey D. Luffy
entered the Whale Forest, Roddy and
Blackback
attacked him despite
Bepo
's assurance that he was a friend. As Luffy clashed with Roddy, Blackback wondered why Roddy's
Electro
did not work on Luffy. After
Carrot
arrived and pacified Roddy with a floating piece of cloth for him to attack, which ended up leaving him with his horns stuck in a tree, Roddy withdrew on
Pedro
's command.
That night, when the
Straw Hat Pirates
came to the Whale Forest to see
Nekomamushi
after visiting
Inuarashi
, Roddy and Blackback apologized to Luffy for attacking him.
The following day, as
Bariete
rang the bell and spoke of the arrival of
samurai
, Roddy and the rest of the minks rushed to Kurau City. When
Kin'emon
and
Kanjuro
revealed themselves, Roddy and the minks welcomed them and revealed that Raizo was on Zou before standing proudly at having kept his presence a secret.
When Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, the samurai, and the
pirates
returned from the Whale Tree with Raizo, Zou began shaking as
Zunesha
started crying out, throwing Roddy and the others into a state of panic.
Jack had returned and was attempting to destroy Zou by killing Zunesha, who retaliated on
Kouzuki Momonosuke
's command and sank Jack's fleet with one blow, calming down Roddy and the others in the process.
Later on, he requested to go with the Sanji Retrieval Team because he had fought with Luffy, but was told to stay behind on Zou by Nekomamushi.
Wano Country Arc
[
]
The Guardians accompanied Nekomamushi on his quest to search for
Marco
. They later arrived at the island where Marco was working as a doctor. The Guardians were asked to wait at the coast while Nekomamushi spoke to him.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, the Guardians arrived at Wano along with Marco and
Izou
.
After infiltrating
Onigashima
, the minks waiting on the roof of the Skull Dome until Kaidou arrived there with the Scabbards. When Jack and a platoon arrived, Roddy and
Blackback
urged Nekomamushi to focus on Kaidou. With the full moon in view, the minks then transformed into their Sulong forms.
