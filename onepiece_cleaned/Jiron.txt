.
Appearance
[
]
Jiron is a man with shaved, stripe-dyed hair. He wears a goggle-shaped mask over his eyes, headphones and a fuzzy cape draped over his shoulders.
Personality
[
]
As a member of the Revolutionary Army, Jiron has no qualms with challenging the World Government, especially with his status as an officer.
Jiron is a bit of a trickster and likes partaking in bets. He seems to respect
Sabo
, referring to him with an honorific as "Sabo-san" unlike most of his compatriots.
He has a habit of using
je
(
ジェ
?
)
at the end of his sentences, instead of the standard sentence-ending particle
ze
(
ぜ
?
)
. In the
VIZ
translation, this is rendered as swapping "y" for "j" in words, such as "you" becoming "jou".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a deputy commander within the Revolutionary Army, Jiron has some degree of command over lower ranking revolutionaries, especially those within the North Army, where his authority is second only to his direct superior, Karasu.
Jiron is capable of eating inedible objects, not suffering any sort of consequence from doing so. It is unknown if this is due to a
Devil Fruit
ability or not.

Egghead Arc

]
Jiron and his fellow deputy commanders
Ushiano
,
Ahiru
and
Gambo
were at the coast of Momoiro Island when they spotted a ship sailing towards them. Gambo suggested a bet over whether the ship was an enemy, to which Jiron agreed and bet on it being
Sabo
returning. After Jiron turned out to be correct, Gambo refused to pay and accused him of cheating with a telescope, while Jiron ate the telescope to erase the evidence.
Later, Jiron is seen listening to
Vegapunk
's broadcast with the other revolutionaries.
