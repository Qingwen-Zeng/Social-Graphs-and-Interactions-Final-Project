"Sky Rider" Shura
was one of the four priests of the
Upper Yard
, who punished criminals with the
Ordeal of String
during
Enel
's reign.
He rode a giant flying bird named
Fuza
.
He is a major antagonist during the
Skypiea Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Shura resembles a
stereotypical
aviator from the early 1900s: he has a thin, pointed mustache that splits into two parts; on his head there is an aviator hat decorated with wings, and a pair of goggles on the front. His attire is composed of an orange fur-lined jacket, with puffy brown sleeves split into sections by beige strips of fabric; loose matching orange pants held up by a belt, fur-lined gloves and boots, and a purple scarf around his neck. He's dark haired, and on his back there is a pair of downturned wings, a standard feature of all the inhabitants of
Birka
. He carries his weapon of choice, a
jousting
lance
, powered by a
Heat Dial
, and is almost always seen riding his pet giant bird,
Fuza
.
Personality
[
]
Like all the other priests, Shura is confident in his abilities, and willing to kill every transgressor. Despite his proven cruelty, he has shown some moments of apparent pity and understanding, such as when he was talking to
Chopper
, even referring to him with his first name. However his overconfidence is what led to his defeat as he greatly underestimated Wyper when Shura thought that Wyper was attempting to use an Impact Dial similar to what Gan Fall used on him before when it was actually a Reject Dial.
Relationships
[
]
Priests
[
]
He did not have a good friendship with
Gedatsu
,
Ohm
, and
Satori
. Between them, there is a type of competition that consists of who kills the criminal first and they will fight among themselves to know who is the strongest.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Shura is often seeing riding his giant bird
Fuza
, thus being able to fly and attack enemies from above. The animal has a
Flame Dial
in his mouth, and so has the ability of breathing fire. Shura is also exceptionally durable, having survived being struck by a Reject Dial at point blank though he was knocked unconscious, while the same attack temporarily killed his superior Enel by stopping his heart.
Ordeal of String
[
]
Further information:
Ordeal of String
Shura was the priest in charge of testing intruders with the
Ordeal of String
, which had a survival rate of 3%. The area where the Ordeal took place was filled up with long, almost invisible strands of String Cloud, which slowly trapped the transgressors, making them unable to move, and helpless against Shura's attacks.
Weapons
[
]
Further information:
Heat Javelin
A javelin with a Heat Dial.
Shura is one of the priests, making him one of the strongest fighters under the command of
Enel
. He fights with a spear called
Heat Javelin
, which has a
Heat Dial
inside it,
granting incendiary capabilities to the weapon, which burns whatever it strikes.
Haki
[

Main article:
Haki
Shura has the ability known as
Observation Haki
, but in the sky islands it is known as "Mantra". With Mantra, he can predict what his enemies are planning before they do it, and can act accordingly.
History

Past
[
]
Six years before the start of the series,
Enel
destroyed the sky island
Birka
, and took his
God's Army
to
Skypiea
. They defeated
Gan Fall
, his
Divine Squad
, and the
Shandians
and then took over the
Upper Yard
.
Sky Island Saga
[

Skypiea Arc
[
]
Shura,
Ohm
, and
Satori
chased after
Zabo
and fought amongst themselves over who would get to kill the man.
Wyper
interrupted them, but
Enel
struck down the fugitive.
Gedatsu
then arrived and informed the other priests about the
Straw Hat Pirates
who had entered
Skypiea
illegally.
Shura burning the Merry with his javelin.
When
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Usopp
, and
Sanji
entered the Upper Yard, Shura and the other priests waited to see which challenge the Straw Hats would choose.
While Satori handled the three Straw Hats, Shura and
Fuza
flew to the
Sacrificial Altar
where the
Going Merry
had been brought. He found only
Tony Tony Chopper
and was irritated by the small offering. Meanwhile, Chopper blew on the whistle that Gan Fall had left for emergencies.
After playing with his victim and destroying parts of the ship, Shura decided to kill Chopper. However,
Gan Fall
arrived and the two fought a battle in the sky.
After an even match, Shura used his ordeal to trap Gan Fall and pierce him with his
Heat Javelin
.
After Gan Fall fell into the river, Chopper dove in after him, which shocked Shura because Chopper was a
Devil Fruit
user. Shura then remembered that
Pierre
was one as well and knocked the bird into the river.
When the
Shandian
army invaded the Upper Yard,
Shura, Ohm, and Gedatsu fought against the force.
However, once the Shandia began retreating, Enel summoned the priests to his temple.
That night, the three priests bickered while waiting for Enel to arrive.
Yama
told them to be quiet in Enel's presence, but Shura pointed out that Enel was not there. Enel suddenly appeared, electrified the priests, and flipped onto his throne. He informed them that the intruders were searching for gold on Upper Yard and that the Shandia would attack again tomorrow, so he gave them permission to roam the island as they liked, as the
Maxim
was near completion for them to depart for the
Fairy Vearth
.
With a Reject Dial, Wyper defeats Shura.
The next day, Shura trapped the Shandia warriors in his Ordeal of String.
Wyper
, who was the only warrior not caught, allowed himself to get stabbed by Shura's Heat Javelin so that he could quickly defeat the priest with a
Reject Dial
. Shura was thereby the first person to be taken down in the survival game.
After Shura's defeat, Fuza flew away.
After Luffy defeated Enel, the Shandia gathered the unconscious priests (except Gedatsu) and banished them to
Cloud Drifting
.
