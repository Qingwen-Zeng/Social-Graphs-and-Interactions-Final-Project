History
[

Past
[
]
Less than three years before the
Summit War of Marineford
, A O and his crew had been trying to invade Whitebeard's territory. However, they soon became subordinate to the Whitebeard Pirates.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Marineford Arc
[
]
A O and
his crew
, along with a fleet of 42 other infamous pirate crews subordinate to the
Whitebeard Pirates
, attacked
Marineford
to save
Portgas D. Ace
from his execution.
Later, he and the other
New World
pirates allied with Whitebeard Pirates were attacked by the
Pacifista
army.
After
Squard
stabbed
Whitebeard
and claimed that Whitebeard sold out his subordinate crews to save Ace, A O began to doubt Whitebeard. After Whitebeard proved his loyalty by giving the pirates an escape route, A O was happy to know the truth and continued fighting the
Marines
.
A O and other New World captains support Luffy and Ivankov.
After the siege wall was raised and
Admiral
Akainu
melted the ice with
his magma powers
, A O boarded Whitebeard's hidden ship and entered the plaza with the help of
Little Oars Jr.
Later, he followed Whitebeard's order in supporting
Monkey D. Luffy
and rejoiced when Luffy managed to free Ace.
However, their excitement was short-lived when Akainu provoked Ace and took his life. When the admiral aimed for Luffy's life, A O and the other pirates made protecting Luffy their top priority.
When the
Red Force
arrived at Marineford, A O was shocked to see that the
Emperor
Shanks
and
his crew
were there.
After Shanks called for a ceasefire, A O and the other pirates left the battlefield.

Zou Arc
[
]
Weevil decimates the A O Pirates.
Two years after Whitebeard's death, A O and his crew got into an argument with
Edward Weevil
, who had already destroyed 15 other subordinate crews on his path to take out the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates. The fight was caused in part by their claim that the only sons of Whitebeard were his crew, and so Weevil decided to wipe them out in retaliation for their relation to his alleged father. During the fight, the A O Pirates were completely wiped out, with the town being destroyed in the process and A O himself being knocked out as the surrounding area went up in flames.
