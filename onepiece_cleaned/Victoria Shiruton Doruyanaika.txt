Doruyanaika resided on
Kutsukku Island
with Kid and Killer, and was their first crush. One day, they ate udon noodles in curry soup for lunch together, and Doruyanaika got it all over herself. Because she was covered in brown sauce, Kid and Killer laughed at her, and she beat them up for it before not speaking to them again.
Some point later, Doruyanaika was killed by the criminal gang ruling the country she resided in.
Legacy

Doruyanaika's death had a large impact on Kid and Killer. In response to her murder, the duo along with
Heat
and
Wire
revolted against the gang and overthrew them from power. The four of them then set out to sea as a
pirate crew
, naming their ship the
Victoria Punk
in her memory.
Kid and Killer still hate curry udon noodles to this day due to their memory of the interaction.
