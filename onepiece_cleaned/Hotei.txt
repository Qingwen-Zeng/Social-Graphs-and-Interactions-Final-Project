He wears a light-colored kimono with dark circle patterns that leaves his hairy chest exposed, dark-colored bottoms, and a cloak with a dark jagged design on the bottom.
Personality
[
]
While under the command of
Kurozumi Orochi
, Hotei served the
shogun
loyally, showing no disapproval at the corrupt administration. However, Hotei was not faithful to Orochi as an individual, as once the shogun was beheaded by
Kaidou
, the Mimawarigumi captain unhesitatingly switched his allegiance to the latter, when given the option of submission or death, going against the standard
samurai
code of loyalty.
He seems to greatly enjoy the annual banquet held at
Kaidou's lair
during the
Fire Festival
.

History

Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
escaped after instigating a fight in the
Flower Capital
during
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution, Hotei and the
Mimawarigumi
began patrolling the capital streets to protect
Kurozumi Orochi
and capture the
pirates
.
A week later, the Mimawarigumi accompanied Orochi to
Onigashima
to party with
Kaidou
and the
Beasts Pirates
during the
Fire Festival
. Before heading out,
Fukurokuju
told Hotei and the
samurai
to inform everyone that
Kyoshiro
would be looking over the Flower Capital during the event, and Hotei remarked that the
yakuza
boss was unlucky to have to miss out.
While the Golden Kagura festivities were occurring, Hotei drank alongside Orochi.
Later, Kaidou came to the Live Stage to announce his "
New Onigashima Project
". When Orochi protested this project, Kaidou beheaded him. He then gave the Mimawarigumi and
Orochi Oniwabanshu
the ultimatum to join his
pirate crew
or die, and Hotei pledged the Mimawarigumi's service to him.
As the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
waged an
all-out war
in Kaidou's stronghold, Hotei noticed
Fukurokuju
wandering off somewhere.
Hyougoro defeats Hotei and the Mimawarigumi.
After
Queen
unleashed the
Ice Oni
virus
, Hotei and his allies found themselves under attack by those who were infected. After Queen gave
Apoo
the antidote, Hotei ordered his allies to retrieve it.
After
Hyougoro
had been infected by the Ice Oni virus and physically returned to his prime self, Hotei and the Mimawarigumi challenged him, but they were
struck down
by the former yakuza boss.
