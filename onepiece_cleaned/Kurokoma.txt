Early Concepts
[
]
Road To Laugh Tale
showed concept art of a deleted scene which showed Kurokoma in person and fleshed out his personality and motivations. In the concept art, he is given the full name
Kurokoma Kihei
(
黒駒きへい
?
)
, and is described as "
kyōkaku
(
侠客
?
)
of the Capital" and "self-proclaimed rival of Hyougoro". The scene shows his subordinates bringing a captured
Tsurujo
to him to be held hostage and force
Kin'emon
and
Denjiro
to give back the Mountain God cub. Kurokoma then reveals his intention of luring its parent to attack Hyougoro, which in the actual manga was only a deduction by Denjiro. In the final manga, Kurokoma's subordinates and Tsurujo are eaten by the Mountain God before reaching the Flower Capital and Kurokoma.
