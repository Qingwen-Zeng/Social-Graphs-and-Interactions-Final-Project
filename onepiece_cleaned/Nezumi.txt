Captain Nezumi
is a
Marine
captain
of the
16th Branch
in the
East Blue
.
Highly corrupt, he covered up the vast majority of
Arlong
's actions in the
Conomi Islands
in exchange for bribe money.
Due to his actions, he can be considered the secondary antagonist of the
Arlong Park Arc
. He is also the one responsible for officially making
Monkey D. Luffy
a wanted criminal to the
World Government
by requesting his first ever
bounty
.
Appearance
[
]
Nezumi is a slim, dark-haired man with—appropriately for his name—a strongly mouse-like appearance.
His eyes are constantly narrowed, while his facial hair consists of a thin goatee and six long, wire-like whiskers on his upper lip. His
Marine uniform
is heavily customized, with the standard cap converted into a mouse-eared
cowl
, connected to a buttoned-up
greatcoat
that reaches to his feet, accessorized with a belt and blue
epaulets
.
His coat carries a blueish-grey color in the
TV anime
, which is dulled in the digitally colored manga and
Episode of East Blue
.
Personality
[
]
As his mouse-like appearance suggests, Nezumi is craven, opportunistic, and utterly without integrity. His greed is so strong that he will conspire long-term with criminals, suppress his personal revulsion of
Fish-Men
, and even directly attack civilians at the prospect of money.
Ordinarily, he displays a smug, supercilious air, expecting his rank alone to command respect and obedience; if overpowered, he will immediately cower and beg, until he has managed to retreat to a safe distance.
His
signature laugh
,
"Chi chi chi chi"
(
チチチチ
?
)
, mimics the standard onomatopoeia for mouse squeaks.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a
Marine Captain
and head of the 16th Branch, Nezumi has authority over (at minimum) dozens of armed subordinates. However, he appears to rely solely on his rank against threats, and has demonstrated no personal combat capabilities; at most, he has some swimming ability, enough to make an escape through
Arlong Park
's harbor.
The following events are

Weapons

In the
anime
, he carries a
pistol
, and appears relatively competent in its use.

History

East Blue Saga
[

Arlong Park Arc
[
]
For a time, Nezumi and his unit deliberately ignored the
Arlong Pirates
' tyranny over the
Conomi Islands
in exchange for monthly cash bribes. While
Arlong
took great pride in the arrangement and considered the Marines "honored guests" (even volunteering
Hatchan
as a private ferry for them), Nezumi always kept his time at
Arlong Park
to a careful minimum, partly because he found the
Fish-Men
unsettling.
One day, after a routine payoff, Arlong informed Nezumi of a
treasure
buried in nearby
Cocoyasi Village
: the cash and valuables that
Nami
had been hoarding for eight years to buy the village back from Arlong. Knowing the hoard qualified as stolen property, Nezumi eagerly brought his unit there, and commandeered
Genzo
to lead them to Nami's house.
To the outrage of Genzo,
Nojiko
, and especially Nami, the Marines ransacked the entire property, intent on nothing beyond confiscating Nami's efforts.
When Nami and her guardians furiously realized that the Marines were allied with Arlong, Nezumi ordered his men to respond with armed force; though Nami and Genzo avoided injury, Nojiko was shot in the waist. Soon after, Nezumi uncovered the hoard—
93,000,000 in total—and reveled in it, heedless to the fact that he'd spurred Nami and Genzo to their breaking points.
Their reactions, borne of sheer desperation, would ultimately lead to the
Straw Hat Pirates
storming Arlong Park and completely crushing the Arlong Pirates.
Nezumi beaten up for trying to spoil the Cocoyasi Villagers' victory.
On witnessing the fall of Arlong Park, Nezumi tried to hijack the Straw Hats' victory and claim all the credit—as well as Arlong's private coffers—for himself. However, he and his unit were soundly beaten by
Roronoa Zoro
and the rest of the Straw Hats; Nami herself delivered the final blow, then "requested" that he return the stolen money and help the local communities (especially the decimated
Gosa Village
) recover from Arlong's reign. Helpless and terrified, Nezumi quickly agreed, before retreating to a safe distance and swearing revenge against the Straw Hats'
captain
Monkey D. Luffy
.
Some time later, Nezumi returned to the Branch 16 base and reported the incident to his superiors; to his annoyance, his subordinates could only supply a photograph of Luffy with a completely harmless smile.
Nevertheless, the report prompted
Marine Headquarters
to issue a
30,000,000
bounty
for Luffy—unprecedented for the
East Blue
.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga, Nezumi orders his subordinates to "disperse" Nami, Nojiko, and Genzo
before
finding the buried money, and one of these subordinates is implicitly the one to shoot Nojiko. In contrast, the anime has Nezumi discovering the money first, then personally drawing a pistol on Nami when she tries to attack—and shooting Nojiko as she tries to restrain Nami.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
His name, following the theme set by his appearance and character, refers to the Japanese word for
mice, rats, and similar rodents
(
鼠
,
Nezumi
?
)
.
Per standard policies, the
4Kids-dubbed anime
edits his uniform's "MARINE" emblems to "NAVY". His
pistol
is recolored to seem more toy-like, and his shooting of Nojiko is heavily condensed (though not wholly removed).
In both the 4Kids and
Funimation
-dubbed anime, his rank is given as
Colonel
rather than
Captain
.
