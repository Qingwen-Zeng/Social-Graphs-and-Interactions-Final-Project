and
Chopper
about how he and the other children ended up on
Punk Hazard
.
He told them that they were sick and that it would take a year for their disease to be cured. Later, due to the
drug
's side effects, he suffered from withdrawal symptoms, and grew desperate for the drug. He was seen chasing after
Mocha
, attempting to forcibly take the candy from her.
Eventually, when Mocha swallowed all of the candy and suffered a severe overdose, the children started to question why would the candy cause such pain, leaving them vulnerable to Chopper administrating a sedative.
