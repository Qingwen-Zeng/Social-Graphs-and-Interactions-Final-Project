Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The anime expands the number of instances that Keith is seen. He was only seen during flashbacks of the Beast Pirates' invasion in the manga and not the actual
Zou Arc
. Although he most likely did partake in the general events that also involved the Mink Tribe and the Guardians during the Zou Arc, his presence in these events were only seen in the anime.
