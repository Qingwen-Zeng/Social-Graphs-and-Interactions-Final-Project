In the anime, Lemoncheese's role is expanded, such that her conversation with Seki is joined in by other monarchs expressing their own views. Furthermore, the anime establishes that Lemoncheese has known Seki for at least four years, since the latter discussed matters of his kingdom with her four years ago.
