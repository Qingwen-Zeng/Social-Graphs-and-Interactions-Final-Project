Chinjao
,
formerly known as
"Don Chinjao"
and
"Chinjao the Drill"
, is a former
pirate
, the leader of the
Chinjao Family
, and the retired 12th leader of the
Happo Navy
. He also joined as a gladiator at the
Corrida Colosseum
to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
.
He has a
bounty
of
542,000,000. Although at first he confronted
Luffy
for his hatred against
Garp
, he became his ally during the
Dressrosa Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Chinjao is an elderly man, with very thick white eyebrows, a long white beard and mustache. He is a large human, about twice as tall as most humans but still not as tall as the late
Edward Newgate
. He is bald, with a dent on the crown of his head, and has the number "12" tattooed on his left temple representing that he was the 12th leader of the
Happo Navy
. Chinjao sports a pale green shirt with white linings, that shows his chest and round belly. He also wears dark yellow pants.
Although Chinjao's expression is usually calm and serene looking, his expression changes to a fiercer look when enraged, with his facial hair waving upwards.
In his youth, he wore a long, buttoned, blue-colored shirt, with light green circle patterns and a yellow, grey captain's coat draped on his shoulders. He had a long-pointed head, which gave him his epithet "the Drill". However, after a punch from Garp, his head was forced into its dented appearance. A glancing punch from Luffy later reverted it to normal.
Not long after that though, a kick from his grandson,
Sai
, bent it.
In the
anime
, while under the effects of the
Hobi Hobi no Mi
, he appears as a Santa Claus-like doll.
At Sai's wedding, he wore a bowtie and a mantle.
Personality
[
]
He seems to be a quiet and calm person, as he did not react to
Luffy
defeating
Spartan
. He is quite perceptive as, unlike many people in the Colosseum, he saw through Luffy's disguise. His immense presence, imposing nature led to him having a serious, solemn demeanor.
Chinjao carries a great deal of pride for his own abnormal head; which gave Chinjao the capacity to hold an enormous grudge against Garp for shrinking it. His grudge would even carry over to a child whom he claims would inherit their parent's sin, as he wanted Luffy to pay for his grandfather Garp's actions, and even commented on how he would have killed Dragon if he knew that he was Garp's son sooner.
Despite his grudge, he is at least able to maintain civility by addressing his enemies with an honorific suffix.
However, this is short-lived as he can enter into a violent rage at the prospect of Garp's bloodline being near him.
Despite being incredibly vengeful, he is also immensely grateful to those who do him favors. After Luffy returned Chinjao's pointed head, Chinjao's grudge has ceased to exist.
He also holds younger pirates like the
Worst Generation
in low regard, going so far as to praise the Marines for cleansing the
demonic blood
of Roger two years ago, thereby pulling the sprout that showed the most potential as a pirate.
Importantly, the only one he considers to have potential of the Worst Generation is Blackbeard.
He always seems confident in his own fighting capabilities. During his fight with Garp, he believed that the Marine would end up losing his fist. At the Corrida Colosseum, he did not think highly of Luffy during their battle despite the pirate's reputation and believed that he will succeed in killing the Straw Hat captain.
Prior to losing to Garp, Chinjao seems to be somewhat merciful, having ordered his men to simply round up the thieves attempting to steal his treasure and then send them drifting across the sea.
He still addresses his enemies with an honorific suffix and politeness in civil conversations, such as knocking out some of the competitors in Block C while letting them off by knocking them out with Supreme King Haki. However, Chinjao happens to be rather brutal in combat, as he knocked away numerous competitors to get to Luffy in Block C. Unlike Sai, he would even allow
Baby 5
to commit suicide given a misunderstanding between her and Sai, going as far as to try preventing him from saving her life and attempting to take both their lives after Sai continued to do so.
Chinjao is proud of the Happo Navy and his family. He would expand his military power through an arranged marriage between Sai and the daughter of the leader of the Niho Navy. When Sai was preventing Baby 5 from committing suicide, Chinjao declared him to be a disgrace to the navy and the family. However, after Sai bent his pointed head, Chinjao cried in joy over his grandson's power instead of getting angry, showing affection and gratitude of his family's strength, as he would call off the arranged wedding and declared that he would give his title of "Don" to Sai.
Like most notable characters, he has a
unique laugh
: "Hiyahoho".
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Sai and Boo
[
]
Chinjao shares an affectionate relationship with his two grandchildren,
Sai
and
Boo
. When he became enraged and tried to murder Luffy, the two of them could barely calm him down, though he did refer them with affectionate regard, and did not try to harm them for interfering as he did with
Cavendish
.
While Sai and Boo were turned into toys, Chinjao completely forgot about them, saying in a conversation with Doldo that he wished that he had grandchildren.
Chinjao would regain his memory of his grandchildren and they would seek to defeat Doflamingo for enslaving them. During the battle against the Donquixote Pirates, Chinjao became angry at Sai's "proposal" to Baby 5, due to a misunderstanding. He reminded Sai of the arranged marriage between him and the daughter of the leader of the Niho Navy. Upon further miscommunication, Baby 5 attempted to commit suicide and Sai tried preventing her from taking her own life, but Chinjao attempted to intervene, saying that he was helping an enemy. When Sai continued to ignore his grandfather's words, Chinjao declared him a disgrace to their family and navy while trying to attack both of them with his pointed head.
When his grandson Sai managed to bend his head, rather than be angry, he actually cried tears of joy because his grandson managed to surpass him. He then proceeded to give him full control of his navy, his title of Don, and named the technique he used to bend his head after his own ultimate technique.
Baby 5
[
]
At first, the two were enemies given their respective association with Luffy and Doflamingo. During the Birdcage game, Chinjao thought that Sai was "proposing" to Baby 5 given a misunderstanding, and given further miscommunication, Chinjao would allow Baby 5 to commit suicide, going as far as to prevent Sai from saving her.
After having his head bent by Sai, Chinjao was overcome with joy and not only he declared the title "Don" to him but also called off the arranged marriage to let Sai marry Baby 5. After the downfall of the
Donquixote Pirates
, Chinjao and his grandsons toasted with Baby 5 during a celebration. He later participated in Sai and Baby 5's wedding and celebrated their union, indicating that he has accepted her as a granddaughter-in-law.
Allies
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Chinjao originally saw Luffy as an enemy based on his heritage with Garp. Due to this, Chinjao desired to take out his grudge against Garp on Luffy. As with Garp, Chinjao shows a level of civility by referring to Luffy with the honorific suffix "
-kun
".
However, this was short-lived, as Chinjao lost control of himself and tried to kill Luffy, ignoring his primary reason for entering the tournament and nearly getting himself disqualified.
During Block C's battle royale, Chinjao plowed through the many other contestants to reach Luffy alone.
Chinjao desires to kill Luffy as opposed to Garp in order to leave the famed Marine in despair of losing someone precious.
During their clash, Chinjao did not hold Luffy in high regard, even stating that he had no chance of being
Pirate King
and disrespecting Ace's death. Ironically, when Luffy defeated him, he inadvertently returned the one thing Garp took away by restoring Chinjao's pointed head.
After the match, Chinjao became grateful for what Luffy has done and let go of his hatred towards him. He attempted to thank Luffy for restoring his head, but his efforts cause Luffy to get the wrong idea and run off while Chinjao's newly developed respect for Luffy made him think of having his grandsons help the Straw Hats.
During the Birdcage, he got the chance to tell Luffy that he no longer has any ill-will towards him or his family and cooperates with Luffy in the decisive battle against Doflamingo to repay his debts.
Enemies
[
]
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
After
Doflamingo
deceived him by sending him to an underground dungeon, he declares his grudge against him and his descendants much like his grudge against Garp.
After Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his "birdcage", Chinjao assisted Luffy in the battle against him.
Lao G
[
]
Chinjao fought against
Lao G
and developed something of a rivalry with him. After a tough fight, Lao G defeated Chinjao when he unleashed his full power and thought Sai was proposing to Baby 5.
Silvers Rayleigh
[
]
Chinjao apparently holds a grudge against
Rayleigh
, as when Luffy reveals Rayleigh is the one who taught him to control Haki, Chinjao expressed displeasure to know the Pirate King's right hand still lives.
Others
[
]
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
In the past, Chinjao was a known enemy of
Monkey D. Garp
and battled for many times;
the latter whom was determined to defeat his unbent head and then succeeded in doing so. Not only was he nearly killed by the Vice-Admiral, but also lost his power and fortune to the Marine.
For this reason, Chinjao bears a grudge against Garp and wants to take it out on his grandson, Luffy. The grudge extends to Garp's son,
Dragon
, stating that if Chinjao knew sooner that Dragon is Garp's son, he would have killed the man before Luffy could come to this world.
Believing that death is too good for Garp himself, Chinjao instead desires to kill Luffy so Garp would live in despair of losing someone close.
Despite this, he shows a certain level of respect (if not out of sarcasm) by referring to Garp with the honorific suffix "
-san
".
After Luffy restored Chinjao's old head, Chinjao said to himself that he no longer holds his grudge against Garp.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the leader of the Chinjao Family, he has complete control over them. He was a known enemy of the famous Marine,
Vice Admiral
Garp
, enforcing a good deal of power.
Chinjao and Garp fought for many times, and Garp destroyed eight mountains as a training to prepare for their last battle.
Since he is a former commander of the Happo Navy he has access to their techniques as he used them quite well in battle.
In his golden age, when he was still a
pirate
, he was considered a rival to both Garp and
Gol D. Roger
,
and had a
bounty
of
542,000,000.
However, the bystanders watching him attack Luffy implied that he may have weakened with age, which he admitted. A battle with Garp caused his head to be flattened and diminished his power while he was still in his prime.
Sometime, following his fight with
Monkey D. Luffy
, he reveals to
Sai
that his illness has worsened since their clash, which, along with his old age, has further depleted his strength.
His losses to his grandchild and then to
Lao G
are actually attributions precisely to this factor; also, the latter had to use all his power and a surprise attack.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Further information:
Hasshoken
Chinjao using Hasshoken.
Chinjao was an extremely powerful master of Hasshoken in his prime. He personally emphasized vibration enhanced punches and prominently headbutts. Before his head was flattened by Garp, his headbutts were powerful enough to split the immensely hard Ice Continent in two, courtesy of his drill-shaped head that allowed him to concentrate all of his strength into that point.
Upon Luffy's strike restoring Chinjao's head to its old, pointed shape, his legendary strength from thirty years ago was restored, enabling him to split the Corrida Colosseum's arena simply by falling onto it head first.
Even something as simple as bowing his head in gratitude can split the ground in front of Chinjao.
However, his head was later bent by
Sai
, and it is unknown if he can fully use it again.
Even with his head blunted, Chinjao can easily destroy rocks and block swords with his head alone. He is very fast, to the point that he deliver a barrage of headbutts that leaves afterimages, much like Luffy's
Gomu Gomu no Gatling
technique. He can easily keep up with Luffy's Gear Second enhanced speed in combat.
Even in his old age, Chinjao remained physically powerful, able to bring down multiple powerful gladiators with his bare hands. He easily defeated
Ideo
, a boxing champion, with one swift strike. He also managed to hold his own against Luffy, a powerful fighter, in a fist fight. Finally, Chinjao is extremely durable, as he slightly bent Cavendish's "legendary sword" Durandal with the force of his head alone without his skin getting pierced, and got up quickly and unscathed after receiving a
Jet Pistol
to the back of the head.
He took several of
Jean Ango
's thrown weapons to the belly without any serious injuries, though it did cause him some bleeding and pain, while also acting in a manner similar to rubber, in that he bounced the weapons that hit him in the stomach and not long afterwards he reached full recovery with no permanent damage done.
He also has enormous stamina to match his durability, as even being weakened beforehand, he took on
Sai
, and although Sai managed to tilt his head effortlessly, he got up without much difficulty, then quickly recovered from a powerful attack from a Lao G empowered. Later, he was attacked by the merciless assault of
Pica
's Charles Stone and even with his previous injuries he was back on his feet in an instant.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Chinjao is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki.
Supreme King Haki
[
]
Chinjao possesses the ability to use
Supreme King Haki
. a rare form of Haki that only one in several million people in the world can use. as shown when He knocked out many of the competitors in Block C without laying a finger on them, an impressive feat considering that most of the participants in the Corrida Colosseum are strong fighters.
and then in a clash with Luffy, their Haki enhanced strikes resulted in the air itself crackling.
Armament Haki
[
]
Chinjao is highly proficient in
Armament Haki
, which he uses to harden his fist to augment the force of his punch and clash evenly with Luffy, an expert Armament Haki user.
He prominently uses it to harden his head in order to split open the
Jewel Ice Sheet
.
He can also use Haki to harden parts of his body like his belly to defend himself from direct attacks.
Observation Haki

History
[
]
Past
[
]
In the past, Chinjao was a pirate
and the 12th leader of the
Happo Navy
. Back then, his head was very tall and pointy, and it was rumored that nothing else could rival its hardness. This gained him the name "Chinjao the Drill".
At one point in time, he obtained an immense amount of treasure, amassed from both his efforts and of those from the rest of his clan, deeming it as his "life's work", and decided to bury it all in the one place no one else could access but him, the
Ice Continent
. Using his incredibly hard and pointy head, he could split open and reseal the continent any time he liked without any fear of anyone else being able to access it. Thus, the Ice Continent was the perfect place to bury his treasure.
Garp flattens Chinjao's pointed head.
Unfortunately, in one encounter with
Monkey D. Garp
, the two faced off with Chinjao using his head which was considered the strongest head of that time and Garp using his fist, attempting to see which of the two was stronger. After the two collided, Garp overpowered Chinjao, causing his head to completely collapse in a telescopic fashion. This incident severely limited his destructive power to the point where he was no longer able to open up his secret treasure stash in the Ice Continent.
As a result, Chinjao not only lost his livelihood, but also his fortune and his powerful head. After having lost so much, he decided to quit as a pirate, completely heartbroken.
This led Chinjao to develop a life-long hatred for both Garp and his descendants.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Chinjao came with
Boo
and
Sai
from the
Kano Country
ostensibly to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
, but with a hidden agenda to investigate a weapons trade that the Donquixote Family was involved in.
Chinjao witnessed
Luffy
defeating
Spartan
. He sat quietly as Boo and Sai spoke to Luffy.
For the battle royale, Chinjao was placed in Block C.
The furious Chinjao ready to fight Luffy and Cavendish.
Later on, as Luffy and
Cavendish
were watching the fights of Block B, Chinjao approached Luffy and asked him how Garp is doing and tells him that he once nearly died by Garp's hand, declaring soon after how he will seek revenge on Garp's grandson.
Before Cavendish could attack Luffy, Chinjao made the first move, striking at Luffy with a headbutt, which he was able to dodge. Chinjao attacked again, but Cavendish stopped his attack with his sword. He then continuously launched a barrage of headbutts until Luffy punched him into the ground. He got back up unfazed and prepared to unleash his fury. Before Chinjao could cause anymore trouble, Boo and Sai stopped him. The two told him that he could just kill Luffy during the Block C fight and reminded him of their true goal.
When Block C began, the Chinjao Family entered the ring, preparing to fight.
As the battle royale in Block C raged on, Chinjao tried to make his way toward Luffy but several of the other gladiators got in his way, intending to take his head. Chinjao, however, used a burst of
Supreme King Haki
to quickly get rid of them. Chinjao then continued heading towards Luffy but was interrupted again by
Jean Ango
, who thanked him for dispatching the other gladiators since he can now collect their weapons and use them himself. Chinjao then continued rampaging and making his way towards Luffy and saying he wished Garp was there to see what he was going to do to his grandson.
Luffy and Chinjao's clash during Block C.
After Boo was brutally defeated by the
Funk
Brothers
, Chinjao told Sai to avenge him. While Luffy was dodging Jean Ango's attacks, the thrown weapons accidentally hit Chinjao. Angered, Chinjao knocked Jean out of the ring with a head butt. Before clashing with Luffy, he eliminated
Ideo
while Luffy defeated Sai. As the two remaining fighters in the battle royale, Chinjao and Luffy clashed their fists against each other, releasing a large wave of Supreme King Haki to burst throughout the arena.
After Luffy declared his dream of becoming the Pirate King, Chinjao asked him who taught him Haki and Luffy answered that it was
Rayleigh
. Chinjao then bursts into tears, mentioning about a treasure he was not able to obtain. When Luffy told him to stick to either crying or getting angry, Chinjao continued his battle with him. Chinjao's change of plan of originally intending to get Sai into the next round surprised his two grandsons.
Luffy using Gomu Gomu no Hawk Rifle against Chinjao.
After Chinjao launched several attacks that Luffy barely avoided, Luffy struck back with his Gomu Gomu no Hawk Rifle, an attack powerful enough to make him cough up blood.
After recovering, Chinjao began mocking Luffy, telling him that those known as
the Worst Generation
are greenhorns who do not know anything of the world and saying that his attempts to surpass
Roger
are laughable. He then enrages Luffy by saying executing
Ace
was a smart move by the
Marines
. Luffy then proceeds to launch himself in the air with Gomu Gomu no Rocket using Chinjao as leverage. He then thought to himself that he would succeed in taking Luffy's life, all while imbuing his head to shield himself from Luffy's incoming Gomu Gomu no Thor Elephant Gun.
Luffy defeats Chinjao and inadvertently restores his pointed head.
The two collided, seemingly matched up until Luffy manages to gain the upper hand, grazing Chinjao's forehead on impact which coincidentally restores his head to its previously pointy shape. He is then knocked out and falls down to the arena, splitting it in half with his newly reformed head. Chinjao then falls into the water, unconscious, officially losing Block C. His grandsons call out to him in horror as he continues to sink into the water.
After the match, Chinjao and his grandsons went to speak with Luffy in the Colosseum corridors. Grateful for having his head restored, Chinjao lets go of his grudge. He tries to bow in respect but ends up accidentally breaking the floor. Thinking that he's being attacked, Luffy runs away. Chinjao thinks to himself about putting his grandsons under Luffy's command as a way to express his gratitude.
Sometime later, Chinjao was supposed to receive treatment for his injuries but instead, he was thrown into an underground dungeon filled with broken
toys
along with some of the disqualified participants. Enraged by
Doflamingo
's trickery, Chinjao declared his grudge against him.
Afterwards, they were joined by Boo, Ideo, and Kelly Funk, and Ricky revealed himself to be the former king of Dressrosa,
Riku Doldo III
. The Chinjao Family then explained how various countries, including the Kano Country, were plagued by wars due to Doflamingo's weapons trading. Chinjao and Boo were alarmed when Sai was abducted and dragged out of the dungeon by
Trebol
.
Chinjao later had a conversation with Riku Doldo III about their retirements, and during the conversation, Chinjao mentions how he wishes he had grandchildren, completely forgetting about Sai and Boo, who were kidnapped and turned into toys. Since they were turned into toys, everyone else forgot about them, something explained by the
Thunder Soldier
.
He was later
transformed
into a toy and forced to work in the underground trade port. When
Sugar
lost consciousness, Chinjao returned to his original form.
He was later seen standing alongside the former slaves as
Usopp
was hailed as their savior.
After Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his "Birdcage", Chinjao and the other colosseum fighters escaped to the surface through an opening created by
Pica
when he rearranged the land with his
ability
.
Chinjao and Elizabello II shatter Pica's hand
When the Chinjao Family found Luffy,
Zoro
, and
Law
, Chinjao managed to tell Luffy that he no longer holds a grudge against his family. Chinjao explained that he also wanted to repay Usopp by defeating Doflamingo. Therefore the Chinjao Family joined forces with Luffy alongside Cavendish, Ideo,
Hajrudin
,
Orlumbus
,
Elizabello II
,
Dagama
,
Abdullah
,
Jeet
,
Suleiman
,
Blue Gilly
, and
Ucy
. When some of the former toys came for the heads of Luffy, Zoro, and Law, the allied colosseum fighters fought them off. They later marched towards the palace and battled against Pica, who appeared as a massive stone giant. Chinjao and Elizabello II broke Pica's giant stone hand by attacking him together.
With Pica's attack warded off, the group pressed on forward and fought through Doflamingo's troops. Pica then prepared to attack with his other arm and Zoro informed Chinjao and Elizabello II that attacking Pica's stone body is useless. After avoiding Pica's strike, they were surprised to see Luffy, Zoro, Law, Abdullah, Jeet, and Ucy climbing on Pica's arm. They were also amazed when Luffy shattered Pica's stone head. When Pica's giant stone body stopped moving, Chinjao and his allies continued on with their assault.
With Zoro fighting Pica and
Sabo
fighting the
Marines
, the colosseum fighters charged up the new King's Plateau and easily defeated the
Donquixote Pirates
' troops standing in their way. They later reached the first level and got ahead of Luffy.
Later, after reaching the second level, Chinjao broke away from the group during the chaos and got even further ahead.
While climbing to the third level,
Gladius
knocked him down with Landmine Punk. The colosseum fighters later banded together to create an opening for Luffy and Cavendish.
Chinjao defeated by Lao G.
Chinjao was later seen battling against
Lao G
.
After Lao G dodged a headbutt, Chinjao received a kick to the head.
Chinjao later thought that Sai and
Baby 5
were engaged and disapproved their "union". Sai tried to make it clear that he had no intention of marrying Baby 5 and Chinjao reminded him that the daughter of the leader of the Niho Navy was supposed to be his fiancée. When Sai tried to stop Baby 5 from committing suicide, Chinjao was infuriated and attempted to attack both Sai and Baby 5 with his pointed head. Sai then bent Chinjao's head with a kick. Acknowledging Sai's strength, Chinjao gave Sai the title of Don. At that moment, Lao G swooped in and knocked out Chinjao.
Chinjao survived Lao G's attack and was quickly tended to by his grandson. A love-struck Baby 5 then remarked that Sai had two ceremonies to prepare for, a wedding and a funeral, which irritated both Sai and Chinjao as the latter was not dead.
After most of the Donquixote Pirates' officers were defeated, Pica preyed on the injured. Chinjao survived Pica's attack and he, Sai, and Baby 5 then watched Pica head towards the Old King's Plateau.
He then witnessed Pica's defeat at the hands of Zoro, and was awestruck by Zoro's feat of strength.
When Doflamingo's Birdcage started shrinking, Chinjao was told by Sai to wake up their fallen allies before the Birdcage reaches them.
Chinjao and the other gladiators defeat the remaining Donquixote Pirates.
Chinjao and the other injured gladiators were later temporarily
healed
by Mansherry. They then defeated the remaining Donquixote Pirates on the New King's Plateau to help the citizens who were fleeing from the shrinking Birdcage.
When the Birdcage came close to the central streets, the gladiators worked together to push back the Birdcage via
Bartolomeo
's
barrier
.
Once Luffy finally defeated Doflamingo, the gladiators witnessed the collapse of the Birdcage.
Later that night after the aftermath, Chinjao and the other gladiators were seen resting at the palace.
Three days after Doflamingo's defeat, the Marines were mobilized to pursue Luffy and his allies. As the Straw Hats made their way to the eastern port, Chinjao and his fellow gladiators assisted the Straw Hats in escaping Dressrosa.
The fighters later gathered at the eastern port, preparing to fight
Issho
. When Issho prepared to attack them with all the rubble from Dressrosa, the fighters quickly fled to the escape ship.
During the clash, Issho used his gravity ability to blow away Luffy, who was then caught by Hajrudin. The fighters and Straw Hats quickly fled across a bridge leading to a gigantic ship in the distance. Issho prepared to drop the rubble on them but was obstructed by the Dressrosa citizens who were pretending to chase after Luffy. They eventually reached Orlumbus' flagship, the
Yonta Maria
. After boarding the ship, the
Happo Navy
was then one of the seven groups that
pledged their allegiance
to the Straw Hats.
After the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
was formed, the Straw Hats and company held a feast to celebrate their victory over Doflamingo.
After Sai received Luffy's
Vivre card
, the Happo Navy parted ways with the Straw Hats.
