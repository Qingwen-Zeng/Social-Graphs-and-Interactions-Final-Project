Jean Bart
is a pirate who was originally introduced as
Saint Rosward
's slave, being part of his
Pirate Captain
Collection.
He currently serves under
Trafalgar Law
as a member of the
Heart Pirates
after being freed from the
World Noble
.
Appearance
[
]
Jean Bart is a large man with a fierce looking face comparable to a guard animal. His size surpasses that of
Jinbe
by roughly two to three times, being able to catch and carry him easily. He has flame-shaped tattoos on his forehead and a scar running above his right eye. He often bares his teeth. He has large sideburns that line the sides of his face as well as a long mane that runs down his back.
When he was a slave, he wore rags and was often forced by his owners to walk on all fours like a lumbering beast. After his liberation and joining the Heart Pirates, he started walking normally again and switched to a black A-shirt. Like all those who were once slaves of the
World Nobles
, Bart has the "Hoof of the Soaring Dragon" mark burnt onto him, which would forever signify him as "less than human", though it's unknown where it is on his body.
After the timeskip, he now wears a boiler suit with the crew's
Jolly Roger
imprinted on it, similar to the other members of the Heart Pirates, and has a full beard in addition to his sideburns.
Personality
[
]
Most of his personality has not been revealed yet, but he seems to be a man of honor and repays his debts as he joined Law's crew, the
Heart Pirates
, after he was freed from the World Noble.
He also seems to be patient and calm as seen at
Amazon Lily
, the opposite of his usual behavior at the Archipelago or the battlefield of
Marineford
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Jean Bart breaks a bridge with one punch.
Jean Bart is an immensely strong man capable of breaking a bridge with a single punch.
In fact, prior to his enslavement, he was a well known pirate captain.
Even suffering abuse from the Rosward family did not deter him, thus demonstrating great resilience and willpower (whereas fellow captain slave
Devil Dias
fled in cowardice, only to get blown up later).
He is also fast and has an extremely durable body due to being able to intercept and stop a bullet from
Van Augur
without a scratch.
Weapons
[
]
He was seen wielding a huge
Flintlock pistol
when defending
Zou
from
Jack
and his army.
History

Past
[
]
Jean Bart was once a renowned pirate captain before he was captured and sold as a slave to the
World Nobles
.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
As a
slave
of Saint
Rosward
, Bart was forced to walk on all fours through
Sabaody Archipelago
. After
Devil Dias
' collar exploded, Saint
Shalria
cruelly shot Devil Dias several times, and Bart left with the
World Noble
family.
Later, while Rosward and his children attended an auction,
Bart was left chained to a stake outside the front entrance of the
Human Auctioning House
.
He did not budge when other patrons fled the building after the
Straw Hat Pirates
assaulted the World Nobles and the
Marines
were called.
After
Trafalgar Law
,
Monkey D. Luffy
, and
Eustass Kid
fought the Marines, Law
removed
Bart's collar, and in return, Bart pledged his service to Law.
As they fled, Bart destroyed a bridge in order to hinder the pursuing Marines; however, their path was blocked by a
Pacifista
so the
Heart Pirates
joined forces with the
Kid Pirates
to take on the
cyborg
.
The events of this battle were not shown, but Law and his crew managed to escape the Pacifista and the
admiral
.
Marineford Arc
[
]
On Sabaody Archipelago, the Heart Pirates watched the broadcast of
Portgas D. Ace
's execution and the resulting
Summit War of Marineford
. When the broadcast was cut off, Law then informed Bart that they were setting sail.
The Heart Pirates arrive at Marineford.
The
Polar Tang
later reached
Marineford
and surfaced so Law could treat the critically injured Luffy.
When Admiral
Kizaru
tried to stop them, Buggy threw down Luffy and
Jinbe
, and Bart caught both of them. While Kizaru and the Marines were distracted by
Koby
's and
Shanks
' interruptions, the Heart Pirates carried Luffy and Jinbe into the ship, and the Polar Tang began submerging
and successfully avoided the attacks from
Aokiji
and Kizaru.
Post-War Arc
[
]
After the Heart Pirates docked on the shore of
Amazon Lily
, Bart and the rest of the crew had to wait there until Luffy and Jinbe returned.
Shortly after
Silvers Rayleigh
swam to the island, Bart left with Law and the rest of the crew.
Bart and the others were pleased to hear Law say that he would wait to go to the
New World
.
During the Timeskip
[
]
While Law was staying at
Punk Hazard
, Bart and the rest of the crew went to
Zou
. During the

's
poison gas weapons
.

Roddy
, Bart tried to stop the fight but was knocked down by
Blackback
. After
Wanda
and
Carrot
arrived and stopped the fight, the Heart Pirates got reacquainted with Luffy and were excited to hear that Law was on Zou as well.
When Law arrived at their location, the Heart Pirates were overjoyed to be reunited with him.
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
returned to the Whale Forest, the Heart Pirates greeted Luffy but were then furious when Luffy and Law went on having a private conversation. The Heart Pirates and Luffy's crew (except
Franky
,
Nico Robin
, and

Wano Country Arc
[
]
The Heart Pirates later infiltrated
Wano Country
. After Law was captured to free Bepo,
Shachi
, and
Penguin
, the Heart Pirates gathered in Ebisu Town and discussed their captain's situation.
The crew later reunited with their captain and they entered the battle with the Beasts Pirates on the day of the
Fire Festival
. After rescuing
Kin'emon
's group, the crew was shocked to hear that
Kaidou
had formed an alliance with
Big Mom
.
After the guards at the torii gates were defeated by the Straw Hats, the Heart Pirates and the
Scabbards
(except Kin'emon and
Denjiro
) traversed to the back of
Onigashima
in the Polar Tang.
When the submarine got close enough, it rose to the surface and Law teleported himself, Bepo, Shachi, Penguin, and the Scabbards with them to Onigashima's back entrance. Once they left, the rest of the crew submerged back underwater.
Jean Bart questions Luffy while he eats.
After Kaidou knocked Luffy off of the floating island, the crew aboard the Polar Tang could hear Luffy speaking and located him underwater.
They brought him onto the submarine and pumped the water out of his stomach.
Luffy eventually woke up and started demanding meat,
so they gave him all the food from the submarine but Luffy demanded more.
Caribou
offered the food he had stashed away in
his swamp
. As Luffy began devouring the food, Jean Bart asked about had been happening on Onigashima.
After Luffy finished eating,
Kouzuki Momonosuke
transformed into an adult dragon, which panicked the Heart Pirates who thought it was Kaidou.
Jean Bart and the others watched in stunned silence as Luffy and Momonosuke bickered over the dragon's struggle to fly. Eventually Momonosuke remembered how and flew up to the island.
The Heart Pirates also made it up the island and were startled as
Yamato
in
his wolf form
rushed past them.
They entered the
Skull Dome
and found their way to where Law and Kid were fighting Big Mom. When the Heart and Kid Pirates tried to rush in to save their injured captains, Big Mom had
Hera
strike them with lightning.
When Big mom is shot down, the crew cheers congratulating their captain. However, the empress would rise again, where she prepared to continue fighting against Kid and Law, where they continued to attack her; until finally, Law manages to hurt her with her sword, while Kid uses an electromagnetic cannon to damage her.
However, they see how Big Mom manages to resist this attack, by then using
Soul Pocus
to steal the life energy of those terrified present, but Law prevents that by using a special ROOM that cancels all the noises it produces, preventing him from using his technique. Kid then hits Big Mom again with her electromagnetic cannon, causing her to sink to the ground and be defeated.
The crew celebrates the defeat of the empress, but suddenly they see the rubble fall from the ceiling.
Later, Kaidou appears in his dragon form, announcing Luffy's death and requesting Momonosuke's official surrender. The Beast Pirates motivated by this, take the opportunity to attack Law and Kid, so Jean Bart joins his crew to protect the captain.
Soon after, every corner of the building is flooded with water.
One week after the defeat of Kaidou and Big Mom, he is with his crew and the Kid Pirates in Tokage Port when the repairs to the ships and
General Franky
are finished. Here he listens to his captain say that the closure of the country is protecting them and what is happening outside. Suddenly, Apoo appears with the latest newspaper, announcing the new emperors and new rewards.
The crew celebrated their captain's new reward and then joined in the festival celebration in the Flower Capital.
A few days later, the crew returned to Tokage Port, where they prepared the submarine to leave.
When everything was ready, the crew left Wano, heading down the waterfall.
Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc

Days later, while sailing, the crew was attacked by the
Blackbeard Pirates
, and
Doc Q
used his
power
to feminize members of the Heart Pirates. Since the submarine was damaged, they had to surface and made for the nearby
Winner Island
.
Jesus Burgess
picked up an entire mountain and threw it at them, but Law destroyed it. Suddenly,
Blackbeard
came flying in on Doc Q and his horse
Stronger
, intending to confront Law for his Road Poneglyphs.
During the confrontation of these two, Bepo detected
Van Augur
and alerted Bart, who covered his captain from the sniper's shot.
The Heart Pirates were ultimately defeated and their ship destroyed. Jean Bart and most of the crew sank with the ship.
