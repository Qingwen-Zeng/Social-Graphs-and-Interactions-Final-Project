.

After
Monkey D. Luffy
led a rebellion in the prison, Cho was freed with the rest of the prisoners. The yakuza bosses later approached
Hyougoro
to show him respect, and upon seeing Luffy's casual way of addressing Hyougoro, they tried to punish Luffy, only to be stopped by Hyougoro. The bosses then let Luffy go and left to recruit their followers from across Wano.
Cho later joined the Weapon Recovery Squad to collect the hidden weapons in the Ringo region. While there, she read
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's last message and praised his cleverness after deciphering the message.
Two days before the raid on
Onigashima
, Cho and the other yakuza bosses contacted
Kin'emon
and informed him of the number of allies they had recruited.
On the night before the raid on Onigashima, the Beasts Pirates destroyed the bridges linking Wano's regions, supposedly preventing Cho and her group from going to the meeting place.
The rebels gathered at Habu Port and on the day of the
Fire Festival
, they joined the
Nine Red Scabbards
at Tokage Port on a fleet of ships.
After the alliance infiltrated Onigashima, Cho received a Beasts Pirates disguise from Kin'emon and joined him in the eastern forces.
The group reached the Pleasure Hall owned by
Black Maria
, and as they traversed through the area, they quickly hid themselves when
Big Mom
looked outside from one of the nearby buildings.
As the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
began their all-out war on the Beasts Pirates, Cho and her group came to
Eustass Kid
and
Killer
's aid.
While fighting the Beasts Pirates at the
Live Floor
, the yakuza leaders planned to go after the Tobiroppo.
As Chopper began mass-producing the antidote for the Ice Oni virus, the yakuza bosses volunteered to guard him.
