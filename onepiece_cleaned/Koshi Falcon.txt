History
[

Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
On the night before the
Raid on Onigashima
, Koshi Falcon was dispatched alongside his allies
Ageha Woman
and
Hawkman
by the
Shogun
Orochi
to blow up the
Thousand Sunny
, as well as various other ships and infrastructure all around
Wano Country
. The order was given with the intent to stop the rebel forces in Wano, which the trio had no issue with, and promptly did as asked.
On the night of the raid, Hawkman confronted the
Straw Hat Pirates
and their allies directly, with Koshi Falcon joining him shortly after. Koshi Falcon was surprised to see that the Sunny was still able to float, but that it didn't matter, as the raiding party was heavily outnumbered. He stood silent as his partners continued with the explanation. Moments later, as a result of Hawkman's gloating,
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Eustass Kid
, and
Trafalgar D. Water Law
easily made their way aboard the ship, before unleashing separate attacks to sink it. Koshi Falcon was not seen afterwards, leaving his fate unknown.
