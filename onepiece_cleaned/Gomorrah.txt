Gomorrah
is one of the two gigantic
King Bulls
owned by the
Franky Family
, the other being
Sodom
.
Appearance
[
]
As a King Bull, Gomorrah is a much larger version of the normal Yagara Bulls in Water 7: an aquatic horse with fins in place of legs, while it wears odd sunglasses that most of the other
Franky Family
members wear.
Gomorrah is pink with dark red stripes and a green mane and fins. He wears his sunglasses on his forehead.
Personality
[
]
Gomorrah is very courageous.
Sodom
and Gomorrah both carried the Franky Family and the Straw Hat Pirates all the way through Enies Lobby until they collapsed because of the attacks they encountered. It is very loyal to the Franky Family due to having been freed from the belly of a
Sea King
thanks to them.
Relationships

Franky Family
[
]
Sodom and Gomorrah were spared by the Franky Family, since they were too full to eat the young Yagara Bulls. The Franky Family raised the two to be large King Bulls. During the Enies Lobby attack, Franky and the Franky Family fought alongside Sodom and Gomorrah, showing a true bond between them.

Sodom and Gomorrah seem to have developed a special relationship with the
doctor
of the Straw Hat crew, since he was the only one who could understand what they were saying and could translate their wishes and feelings to the rest of their comrades. After the battle, Chopper was also the one to treat their serious wounds, for which they were grateful.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
It has enough strength to haul small buildings, and are shown capable of tackling the giants
Oimo
and
Kashii
. Also,
Kokoro
mentions the pair are the highest grade of King Bulls. As indicated by the fact it was found inside a Sea King, while it had the ability to strike giants, it does not have the power to tackle these predators.
History

Past
[

According to Chopper's translations,
Sodom
and Gomorrah were saved by the
Franky Family
from the stomach of a
Sea King
. Since
Franky
was full from eating the Sea King, he did not eat the King Bulls, so in gratitude for saving their lives, Sodom and Gomorrah swore loyalty to Franky forever.
Water 7 Saga

Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
After Luffy gave the Franky Family permission to accompany the Straw Hats to save Franky (who had been taken to Enies Lobby along with Robin), they immediately got Sodom and Gomorrah tied to a boat shaped like a house and then attached it to the
Rocketman
, after which Sodom and Gomorrah kept swimming while the Rocketman charged straight ahead until
Yokozuna
(testing his strength) caused the train to go off course while also causing the Franky Family to become separated from them.
Before they rejoined the Rocketman, they found one of the Puffing Tom's cars drifting through towards them where
Usopp
(as his alter-ego Sogeking) and
Sanji
were after they were separated from the Sea Train.
Upon reaching Enies Lobby, the majority of the Franky Family charged in while the
Galley-La
foremen
Paulie
,
Peepley Lulu
, and
Tilestone
and
Zambai
,
Kiwi
, and
Mozu
mounted Sodom and Gomorrah on treads, the Galley-La foremen riding Sodom and Zambai, Mozu, and Kiwi riding Gomorrah. When they reached the main gate, they faced against the two giants who were guarding it,
Oimo
and
Kashii
. After a fierce combat, they managed to bring the giants down, open the gate, and lead the way for the upcoming Straw Hat Pirates. Once the Straw Hats made it in, Paulie helped them onto Sodom (except Sogeking) before he and the other foremen dismounted to deal with the
Watchdog Unit of the Law
.
The Marines at Enies Lobby cheering after Sodom got struck by a mortar.
The team, riding the giant King Bulls, advanced towards the inner section of the island defeating foe after foe. As they went, Sodom told the Straw Hats how they had met the Franky Family, through
Chopper
's interpretation. After Sodom was struck down by a mortar, the riders moved over to Gomorrah, who carried them onwards.
Unfortunately, Gomorrah was taken down soon afterward by some of the
Just Eleven Jurymen
. He fell for a short while, but fueled by memories of Franky taking him and Sodom in and looking out for the two, managed to summon up the last of his strength. Gomorrah struggled to get up, and began recklessly charging deeper into the island. He hit a building along the way, at which point he claimed to be blind due to damaging his retina in the battle, as Chopper told the crew through his translation. Regardless, he charged through the remainder of the island, making it into the courthouse's courtyard before finally passing out from the pain, though he smiled just before losing consciousness at having completed his task.
Later, during the island's evacuation due to Spandam's initiation of the Buster Call, the two of them, presumably unconscious, were scooped up by Oimo and Kashii (the giants having turned against the World Government after learning from Sogeking that they had been lied to). The giants carried them, the Galley-La foremen, and the Franky Family in their rush to escape Enies Lobby. The giants encountered no difficulty until they reached the front of the island, where they came across three warships led by Vice Admiral
Strawberry
. With all the guns on board trained on them, the giants were forced to stand their ground until Strawberry ordered his men to attack the criminals. They were blown away and thrown off a cliff, seemingly killed. But after the Marines' attention turned towards the Straw Hats, it was revealed that they all had survived thanks to Paulie and his ropes. With the front gate no longer guarded, the group climbed back to the island, and Sodom and Gomorrah were loaded onto the Puffing Tom along with the other members of their family and Galley-La. As soon as news reached them that the Straw Hats had gotten away safely, the Sea Train departed, for a smooth voyage back to Water 7.

Two days after the destruction of Enies Lobby, Gomorrah and Sodom were back on their "feet" and well enough to join the
Straw Hat Pirates
' victory party. Gomorrah was able to regain his eyesight through Chopper's treatment.
