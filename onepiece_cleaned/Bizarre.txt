Personality
[
]
Not much is known about Bizarre's personality other than that he is very loyal to Whitebeard since he was willing to risk his own life to save
Ace
from his execution instead of fleeing through the path he had cleared with his
power
. Also, despite his rather aggressive appearance, Bizarre seems to have some common sense, having warned Ace to ignore Akainu's insults in order to get to safety.

Marineford Arc
[
]
When
Portgas D. Ace
was to be executed at
Marineford
, Bizarre and his crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
to save him. He was seen attacking the
Marines
out of the bay with his fellow allies, and later managed to enter it. After
Squard
stabbed
Whitebeard
and claimed that the Emperor sold out his subordinate crews to save Ace, Bizarre began to doubt Whitebeard. When the
Emperor
gave the pirates an escape route, he happily understood that the Marine had tricked Squard and rejoiced that all this was a lie. When
Akainu
started insulting Whitebeard in order to anger Ace, he warned him to ignore the
admiral
and proceed in the escape, but was unable to stop him and prevent him from clashing with Akainu.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the manga version of Whitebeard and Ace's funeral in
Chapter 590
, Bizarre cannot be seen among those in attendance. However, the anime version of the exact same scene in
Episode 505
explicitly shows Bizarre alongside the other attendees.
Although it can be assumed that Bizarre was at the funeral, there is no visual evidence of his attendance in the manga to support this assumption and, as such, his attendance can only be considered non-canon.
In the anime, he is among the news reports of those defeated, alongside the reports of
Elmy
,
Ramba
,
Whitey Bay
,
A O
, the
Decalvan Brothers
, and
Palms
.
