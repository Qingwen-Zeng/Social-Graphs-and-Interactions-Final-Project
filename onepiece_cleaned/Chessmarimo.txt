History
[
]
Chessmarimo was spit out by Wapol after he consumed
Chess
and
Kuromarimo
and combined them to create a single warrior.
After transforming, Chessmarimo vowed to protect Wapol, and then engaged a fight with
Chopper
. The reindeer ate a
Rumble Ball
, and much to Chessmarimo surprise, he achieved more than his regular three
transformations
. After Chopper evaded their attacks with
Jump Point
, blocked them with
Guard Point
, and destroyed their hammers with
Arm Point
, he used his
Brain Point
to locate Chessmarimo's weak spot. After Chess's chin was identified as the weak point, Chessmarimo was defeated by Chopper's
Kokutei Roseo
.
It is unknown what happened to him after Chopper defeated him.
The following events are

At some point, sometime between the end of
Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah
and
One Piece: Stampede
, Chessmarimo was de-fused, as Chess and Kuromarimo relocated to the
Evil Black Drum Kingdom
to continue serving under Wapol.
