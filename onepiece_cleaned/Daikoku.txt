Appearance
[
]
Daikoku's anime concept art.
Daikoku is a large man with a massive mane of light red hair that stretches down his back and chest. He wears a dark navy blue kimono, two large purple shoulder pauldrons, and a purple headpiece on his head that has horns resembling those of a bull.
Personality
[
]
Like the other members of the Orochi Oniwabanshu, Daikoku is loyal to the shogun
Orochi
to a fault, as he refused to take action against the shogun even when he was threatening his own allies in a mad rampage since he believes Orochi can do whatever he wants. He was also very intent on capturing the intruder
Nico Robin
upon finding her. He can be shaken by things he does not understand, as shown when he witnessed Robin's and
Brook
's
Devil Fruit
abilities.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a member of the Orochi Oniwabanshu, Daikoku is an extremely skilled ninja, being capable of stealthily sneaking up on Robin unnoticed along with the rest of the Oniwabanshu,
as well as sneaking through a crowded banquet hall without drawing attention. He is acrobatic enough, as he was seen crawling on the ceiling when he spotted Robin in the banquet hall.
He also appears to possess some degree of durability as he quickly recovered from a Gigantesco Mano attack. Daikoku has some authority in the Oniwabanshu as he ordered Fujin and Raijin to chase after Hiyori.
His specialty is "Transformation"

History
[

Past
[
]
20 years ago, he was present in the Flower Capital to witness
Kouzuki Oden
's execution.
When
Shinobu
began telling the truth behind Oden's foolish behavior, the Oniwabanshu appeared behind her and stopped her talking.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
After seeing the geisha
O-Robi
suspiciously sneaking around Orochi Castle during
Orochi
's banquet, Daikoku and the rest of the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
snuck up on her
body double
and cornered her in a room.
Robin's body double was given a chance to explain herself, and she claimed to be
Ushimitsu Kozo
, causing the Oniwabanshu to move to capture her as Daikoku revealed that Ushimitsu Kozo had already appeared in the capital that day. Robin's body double then disappeared, and the Oniwabanshu spread out to Orochi's banquet to look for her. When Robin ran away with the young girl
Toko
after the latter created an incident with Orochi, Daikoku spotted her and alerted his comrades.
Some of Orochi's banquet guests asked Daikoku to stop the rampaging Orochi, but he refused, saying capturing the intruder was more important. Daikoku then watched as
Brook
overwhelmed
Fujin
and
Raijin
before he was overpowered by a giant hand created by Robin. He and some other ninja were then chased by Brook, and they eventually realized that the skeleton would not attack them, but then
Nami
attacked the room with a massive thunderclap.
Daikoku later stood guard at the prison in the Rasetsu District where
Shimotsuki Yasuie
was held and scheduled for execution, watching as the former daimyo was killed.
After
Roronoa Zoro
attacked Orochi, Daikoku ordered the firing squad to shoot at the swordsman, but
Franky
blocked the bullets with his body.
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
began a commotion, Daikoku ordered Fujin and Raijin to pursue a
woman
that was seen with Zoro. They were about to capture her but she was rescued by Zoro, confirming that she was an ally to Zoro.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Daikoku accompanied Orochi to
Onigashima
.
After
Kaidou
disposed of Orochi, the Oniwabanshu pledged their loyalty to the
Emperor
.
As the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
waged war in Kaidou's stronghold, the Oniwabanshu fought against the rebels.
After
Queen
unleashed the
Ice Oni
virus, Daikoku and his allies found themselves under attack by those infected.
They were surprised to see that
Hyougoro
's infection had restored him to his former stature and strength.
The legendary yakuza defeated most of the Oniwabanshu, including Daikoku and Kazekage, as well as the Mimawarigumi.
