When an eight year old Robin was looking for refuge from the World Government after escaping from the
Ohara Incident
, Kanezenny took the child in. Robin worked hard for the elderly woman, with Kanezenny acting kind and loving in return. Robin thought she had found her place to stay. However, one evening, when Robin entered the house for dinner, she saw that Kanezenny had led World Government agents into the house to ambush Robin. Robin managed to escape, and this was the first betrayal she ever suffered. Regardless, Kanezenny demanded that the agents pay the bounty for providing information on Robin's whereabouts, and was last seen angrily grabbing the collar of one of the agents she had brought in, screaming at them.
