A character heavily resembling Kinga's concept art can be seen in both the manga and anime during the
Summit War of Marineford
.
Due to the heavy resemblance to the concept art, this character was initially believed to be Kinga; however, with the release of the
Vivre Card databook
, Kinga was revealed to be a different character, resembling his initial concept art less.
