When
Luffy
attacked
Charlos
at the
Human Auctioning House
, Sicily reported the incident to
Sengoku
, citing all parties involved, which included the
Kid Pirates
and
Heart Pirates
. He told him that they had thirteen bounties confirmed, and of those thirteen, five of them were over
100,000,000. He pinned Monkey D. Luffy as the primary offender, since he started the incident. He is about to say it was at the Human Auctioning House, but corrects himself and calls it the "Public Employment Security Office." He goes on to say this this is a high priority incident since three
World Nobles
are being held hostage. He finished his report by telling Sengoku that the pirates had not made any demands yet.
