Tonjit
is an elderly nomad belonging to a tribe that lives on
Long Ring Long Land
.
Appearance
[
]
Tonjit is an elderly man, with wrinkles and a round white beard. He has small round eyes, a round nose, and is missing one tooth. He has a purple-brown hat, with brown fur lining, and brown cloth on the sides. He wears a yellow tunic, with green lining with a circle design on the end of the sleeves, and side of the chest. He has a purple sash, with a red string hanging down. He wears purple shoes, held on by white strings, and grey on the toe area. He also wears vertical zigzag striped purple and tan pants.
Twenty two years ago, he wore the same clothes, but had a less wrinkled face, and a shorter beard, which was black. He also had not lost his tooth yet.
Personality
[
]
Tonjit is a kind-hearted and hospitable, yet incredibly eccentric and absent-minded old man, as when he and Luffy first met, he acted as if he had known Luffy and Chopper his entire life and greeted them as such, only to quickly accept that they were complete strangers, and calmly remarked that explained why he didn't recognize them.
Because of his absent-minded nature, he tends to behave recklessly and sometimes acts without thinking or taking important things into consideration, as he tried to set a world record for the tallest pair of stilts in the world, but didn't consider how he'd get down or that he'd be afraid of heights, resulting in him being stuck for 10 years, and also ate some milk that has gone bad and curdled for a very long time, resulting in him getting food poisoning.
He loves his horse Shelly very much and she also feels the same about him, as he went from his typical calm and easy-going nature to furiously intending to attack Foxy when he shot her.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Though demonstrating no combat ability, Tonjit is markedly durable for a man of his age, surviving an extremely long fall with no injuries beyond a nosebleed. He also appears strong enough to haul a wooden cart several times his size without issue.
Weapons
[
]
Tonjit owns what appears to be a
musket
, though its functionality (and his overall skill with it) remains unknown.
History

Past
[
]
Having loved stilts his whole life, Tonjit spent much of his adulthood obsessed with mastering the world's tallest set. So deep was this obsession that he even disregarded news of
Gol D. Roger
's execution as unimportant.
In his early fifties, he pursued his dream with a set of stilts hand-crafted from Long Ring Long Land's bamboo. While climbing them, however, he realized that he had severe
acrophobia
, leaving him too scared to dismount. In the process, he wandered away from the rest of his tribe, who eventually conducted their regular migration without him; only his beloved horse
Shelly
stayed behind.
As time passed, the bamboo stilts continued growing, trapping Tonjit higher and higher up. However, he managed to survive by eating fruit from equally tall trees scattered around the landscape.

Long Ring Long Land Arc
[

The Straw Hats save Tonjit.
Approximately ten years later, Tonjit was rescued by the
Straw Hat Pirates
, whose captain
Monkey D. Luffy
attacked and broke the stilts after they inadvertently bumped into him.
Initially mistaken for the bamboo's
kami
, Tonjit soon befriended the Straw Hats, sharing all he knew about Long Ring Long Land (as well as some long-curdled milk). He was further heartened to be reunited with
Shelly
, celebrating by taking her on a joyous ride around the prairie. This reunion, however, was cut short by
Foxy the Silver Fox
, who callously shot Shelly on a whim.
While Shelly was quickly mended by
Tony Tony Chopper
, a furious Tonjit threatened to retaliate with his own gun. Concerned for his safety, Luffy warned him down, almost simultaneously accepting a
Davy Back challenge
against
Foxy's crew
. Though supportive of the Straw Hats, Tonjit took no part in the ensuing Davy Back Fight, even patronizing the food stalls set up by the Foxy Pirates.
After the Foxy Pirates were defeated and sent off, Tonjit and the Straw Hats encountered
Admiral
Aokiji
of
Marine
Headquarters
. To their amazement, Aokiji used his
Devil Fruit
powers
to freeze a solid path around Long Ring Long Land. Overjoyed, Tonjit immediately gathered Shelly and all his possessions onto a cart, and - after bidding a final, grateful farewell to the Straw Hats - caught up with his tribe in a matter of weeks.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime's expanded version of the
Long Ring Long Land Arc
, Tonjit's involvement with the
Davy Back Fight
is increased, as the
Foxy Pirates
actively abduct
Shelly
into their crew; correspondingly, the Straw Hats accept Foxy's challenge as a means of retrieving her for Tonjit. Afterwards, he sits in on two of the anime-original games:
During the Run Roller Around event, he gives Luffy a
kiwifruit
, which
attracts
the catlike
Chiqicheetah
; this later inspires the Straw Hats to distract Chiqicheetah from racing by dropping a kiwi tree across his path.
For the Dodge Touch Daruma-san (Red Light/Green Light) event, he serves as referee; his eccentricities keep both the Straw Hats and Foxy Pirates off-balance, most notably forcing Chiqicheetah to eliminate himself by sneezing in his face.
In addition, the anime creates a grandson for Tonjit named
Rittonto
, a "champion hole-digger" who has trained moles to tunnel beneath all of Long Ring Long Land. He, rather than
Aokiji
(whose introduction was moved to a separate island), helps Tonjit catch up with the rest of the nomads.
