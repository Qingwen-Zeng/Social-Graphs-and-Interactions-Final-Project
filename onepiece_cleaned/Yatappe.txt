After
Monkey D. Luffy
led a rebellion in the prison, Yatappe was freed with the rest of the prisoners. The yakuza bosses later approached
Hyougoro
to show him respect, and upon seeing Luffy's casual way of addressing Hyougoro, they tried to punish Luffy, only to be stopped by Hyougoro. The bosses then let Luffy go and left to recruit their followers from across Wano.
Yatappe later joined up with the Rebel Command Squad in the Kibi region where he deciphered the meaning of
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's last message.
Two days before the raid on
Onigashima
, Yatappe and the other yakuza bosses contacted
Kin'emon
and informed him of the number of allies they had recruited.
The rebels gathered at
Habu Port
, and on the day of the
Fire Festival
, they joined the
Nine Red Scabbards
at Tokage Port on a fleet of ships.
After arriving at Onigashima, the rebels were given Beasts Pirates disguises by Kin'emon. Yatappe and his group later infiltrated the
Live Floor
. When the Scabbards and
Izou
launched a surprise attack on
Kaidou
, the rebels revealed themselves as the all-out war on the Beasts Pirates began.
As the battle at the Live Floor raged on, the yakuza bosses planned to go after the Tobiroppo.
As
Tony Tony Chopper
began mass-producing the antidote for the
Ice Oni
virus, the yakuza bosses and
X Drake
volunteered to guard him.
During the struggle, Hyougoro got infected by the virus but physically returned to his prime self. After Hyougoro defeated the
Mimawarigumi
, he ordered Yatappe to end his life before he could completely transform into an ice oni.
Yatappe hesitated and, after composing himself, swung the blade down, but Chopper stopped it and administered the antidote to Hyougoro. As Chopper slapped
Queen
and exclaimed that he was not a "tanuki", Yatappe inwardly apologized for having called him such.
