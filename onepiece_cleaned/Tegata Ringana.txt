As
Donquixote Doflamingo
started closing the Birdcage on Dressrosa, Ringana and some nurses tried evacuating every patient who could not walk out of the hospital. As the Birdcage neared, Ringana began losing hope since there were still many patients inside, and none of the citizens would help him. However, when former king
Riku Doldo III
told all the citizens to keep living and that there was hope, Ringana increased his efforts to evacuate the patients regardless of how many people helped him or not.
He later watched in surprise at how the
floating dandelions
in the air were able to heal one of his patients' legs. He and his patients then continued running away from the closing Birdcage.
