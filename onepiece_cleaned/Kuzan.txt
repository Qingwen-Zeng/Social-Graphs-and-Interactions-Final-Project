Quick Answers
Why did Kuzan, also known as Aokiji, decide to join the Blackbeard Pirates?
Kuzan, also known as Aokiji, decided to join the Blackbeard Pirates to start living for himself instead of for others. He had grown resentful of his time as an enlisted officer and the limitations it placed on his personal freedom. After leaving the World Government, he was eager to live life on his own terms. This desire resonated with Blackbeard, leading Kuzan to accept the offer to become one of Blackbeard's Ten Titanic Captains. Despite his new affiliation, Kuzan maintains his own agenda, often acting as an independent observer.

What led to Kuzan's resignation from the Marines?
Kuzan, also known as Aokiji, resigned from the Marines after a duel with his fellow Admiral, Sakazuki. The duel was a result of their differing views on the direction of the Marines. Kuzan was against Sakazuki's ruthless approach and chose to fight him rather than let him take over. After his defeat, Kuzan decided to resign rather than serve under Sakazuki. His resignation also came with a realization of the corruption within the World Government, leading him to become a wanderer.

Who was Kuzan's mentor during his time as a Marine Admiral?
Kuzan's mentor during his time as a Marine Admiral was none other than Monkey D. Garp. Known for his exceptional teaching skills, Garp has mentored many prominent figures in the Marines. Kuzan sought out Garp to further his training, surpassing the standard Marine training and ready for the next level. Garp initially refused, but eventually took Kuzan on as an apprentice, shaping him into the formidable Marine Admiral we know today.

What was the outcome of the fight between Sakazuki and Kuzan?
The duel between Sakazuki and Kuzan, two powerful characters from One Piece, was an intense battle that lasted for ten days. Both suffered heavy injuries, but in the end, Sakazuki emerged as the decisive winner. Despite Kuzan's impressive abilities, Sakazuki's power and speed were just too much for the 'one piece ice guy'.

Appearance
[
]
Kuzan is an incredibly tall, slim, yet muscular man. At 298 cm tall, he is just slightly shorter than the other two Admirals pre-timeskip
and he is the shortest of the Blackbeard Titanic Captains. He has black, curly hair cut to chin length that fans out at the tips, tanned skin, and an altogether lean, long build.
His standard outfit while in the Marines consists of a white buttoned-up vest with standing collar over a long-sleeved navy-blue shirt, with matching white trousers and black dress shoes. This is all rarely accompanied by a matching white suit jacket.
He also wears a yellow tie divided geometrically by black lines and a sleep mask on his forehead. During his preparations for the war against
Whitebeard
, Kuzan had a white Marine Admiral's coat (golden epaulettes and for him being the ice user, blue cuffs) draped over him like a cape, as did the other Admirals.
He was also seen wearing a green and purple sleep mask at all times two years ago from the present timeline.
In contrast to
Borsalino
and Sakazuki, Kuzan is far younger than his colleagues, being less than fifty years old. His looks, combined with his manner, make him appear even younger than he actually is.
As a child, Kuzan had a grimace on his face. He wore a dirty light blue shirt and a purple pair of shorts with white stripes. He carried an umbrella tied on his back, a bottle of alcohol and a backpack. Also, his hair was curlier compared to his current hairstyle.
In his youth, Kuzan wore a white Marine cap and a shirt.
Twenty-two years ago, during the
Ohara Incident
, Kuzan wore a dark blue bandanna with a white Marine symbol on it, as well as a pair of black round sunglasses, as well as an indigo coat with the Marine emblem on the left chest and the back.
This outfit was also what he wore 27 years ago, during the
Battle of Edd War
.
After the timeskip, his attire bears similarities to what he wore in his 20's. He wears a blue bandana that covers most of his hair, leaving only the tips which fan out. He wears a white V-neck shirt with black trousers, as well as an open dark blue green trench coat that extends past his knees. He also now wears black cowboy boots and travels with a knapsack carrying his belongings, along with his old pair of green round sunglasses. Like his rival
Sakazuki
, he also has grown facial hair, namely, a thin mustache and a beard.
After his duel on
Punk Hazard
, Kuzan received several burn scars spanning from the right side of his neck down to his entire right shoulder and onto his torso. His right hand is also heavily scarred, and he lost part of his left leg, for which he now wears a prosthesis made of ice formed by his Devil Fruit ability.
During the
Egghead Arc
, Kuzan wears a white frilled dress shirt with a purple cravat, black pants, and a dark-colored trench coat with a fur collar which he wears draped on his shoulders.

Personality
[
]
Aokiji's lazy personality: relaxing while talking with the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
Kuzan is a very laid-back man, showing no shock or surprise from almost anything. His lack of interest and "Lazy Justice"
(
だらけきった正義
,
Darakekitta Seigi
?
)
(as he describes his motto himself) often leads others to believe he cannot possibly be a Marine of such a high ranking, which causes them to underestimate him, making him all the more dangerous (it is unknown whether this is a façade or if he is genuinely lazy). However, if he deems a situation worthy, he will take action. During the Summit War at Marineford, Aokiji grudgingly shredded his usual lax and friendly nature, for a more ruthless and aggressive personality, repeatedly targeting Whitebeard himself with his Hie Hie no Mi, managing to severely injure "Diamond" Jozu and generally hampering any attempts at rescue or escape for the invading pirate fleets.
In accordance with the age difference between him and the other pre-timeskip Admirals, Kuzan does not refer to himself with "
Washi
"
(
儂
?
)
, the "I" typical for older men but the "I" more frequently used by younger men and teens, the rather rough "
Ore
"
(
俺
?
)
; altogether, his manner of speaking is far more lax than Borsalino's (who is exceedingly polite), containing a lot of ellipses and contractions, yet lacking the rude connotation of Sakazuki's speech, and being far more calm. He tends to begin addressing people with
"excuse me"/"I hate to interrupt, but…"
(
ちょっとごめんな
,
chotto gomen na
?
)
.
Aokiji is a compassionate man, helping Tonjit at Long Ring Land to cross the ocean with his ability and even letting
Nico Robin
escape the Buster Call on Ohara by providing a small boat while also a trail of ice for her to leave safely even sabotaging the ships that were about to go after her. Despite being a Marine, this compassion can even extend to pirates as long as their actions are mostly benevolent. He chose not to arrest or kill
Luffy
because the young pirate had defeated
Crocodile
beforehand, thus saving Arabasta from the latter's malevolence.
In contrast to his former colleague, Fleet Admiral
Sakazuki
, Kuzan sometimes tolerates compromises with pirates.
He is disgusted by Sakazuki's brutal actions in dealing with situations (such as the
Ohara Incident
), calling him a fool. While he follows Lazy Justice, he does understand the position his ranking puts him in and does not hesitate to do what is necessary for the needs of the Marines, even if reluctantly. He froze his former friend
Jaguar D. Saul
during the Ohara Incident following this reasoning.
As a Marine, Kuzan was a faithful follower of the World Government. His motto used to be "Burning/Fired Up Justice"
(
燃え上がる正義
,
Moeagaru Seigi
?
)
before switching to Lazy Justice. He always tried to follow orders, but sometimes found his own ideals in opposition to them. Even as Kuzan followed his orders, he would occasionally exhibit a sense of mercy and honor other World Government officials did not. Like many characters in One Piece (for example, Jaguar D. Saul and Smoker), after witnessing the senseless murder of many innocent people, Kuzan has come to realize the immoral depths to which the World Government will sink to accomplish their goals.
His relaxed demeanor while performing the more macabre of his duties is similar to that of Borsalino, making him one of the more complicated characters in the series. Despite not really wanting the position of
Fleet Admiral
, he was even more opposed to Sakazuki getting the position due to the latter's immense ruthlessness and dueled his fellow Admiral rather than letting him take it. After being defeated, Kuzan chose to resign from the Marines rather than stay under Sakazuki's command.
Having left the Marines and realizing just how truly corrupt the World Government had become after the timeskip, Kuzan became a wanderer. He still cares for his old friends, rescuing
Smoker
from
Donquixote Doflamingo
's fury during a visit to
Punk Hazard
. However, Kuzan appears to be now involved in shady dealings with pirates, having joined forces with the
Blackbeard Pirates
for unknown reasons. Doflamingo was convinced that Kuzan had something planned while Smoker thought the same, as he was aware of Kuzan's involvement in the
Underworld
. Kuzan reassured Smoker that he had not changed at all, cryptically stating that he could still accomplish things more freely as an independent observer.
After joining the Blackbeard Pirates, Kuzan openly expressed he did so because he wishes to begin living for himself instead of for others, perhaps showing some resentment for his time as an enlisted officer and the things he was made to do or prevented from doing. He wanted to take back his personal freedom and live life on his own terms, something Teach sympathized with and was seen being quite jolly with a somewhat dry sense of humor as they drank together. His determination to follow his newfound path and own way of life is so great, he sternly refused his former mentor Garp's demands including returning to the Marines the latter whom he dearly respected and even admitted to try killing Garp, despite his respect and admiration for him. He also has no qualms attacking the Marines nor killing civilians for the Blackbeard Pirate's goals when necessary.
He has a recurring phrase, "Arara", meaning "Oh, my", which is frequently used when something surprises him.
Relationships
[
]
Marines
[
]
According to
Jinbe
, Kuzan was very popular with the troops of any rank, which was why most flag officers favored him as candidate for the position of Fleet Admiral.
When Kuzan left the Marines and ultimately became a pirate by joining Blackbeard, many Marines including Garp was aghast and shock. Kuzan also has no qualms attacking his former Marines as he froze Hibari, and also directly attacked Garp without hesitation.
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
Kuzan is the former protégé of
Monkey D. Garp
,
and owes Garp a debt for helping him sometime in the past, whether the help was in training Kuzan or something else is unclear.
He also admired, and possibly idolized, Garp for consistently refusing promotions, since the latter was already satisfied with the rank bestowed upon him since the time of Roger. However, with Luffy's choice of piracy, even the favor and admiration are not enough to let him spare Luffy's life during their encounter at
Marineford
, though whether it was because he felt that
Ace
was too much of a risk to be left alive, or because letting Luffy go publicly would get him into severe trouble, or because he has something personal against pirates is unknown.
After Kuzan had left the Marines and had become a member of the Blackbeard Pirates, Garp demanded his former protégé to return to the Marines, which Kuzan refused. The two fought, but Garp was able to easily overpower the former Admiral, while scolding him for losing his way.
After successfully subduing Garp, while the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates looked at the fallen Marine Hero with malice, Kuzan alone gave an emotionless look, though he would later coldly proclaim he intended to kill Garp rather than capture him when he was congratulated on Garp's capture by Teach.
Jaguar D. Saul
[
]
Kuzan was a close friend of
Jaguar D. Saul
. Apparently, one of the reasons that he let Robin go during the destruction of Ohara is because of Saul. He states that he respected Saul's will and felt it was his duty to watch over Robin's life until she found her place. However, this friendship was not enough for Kuzan to spare Saul's life, though it is later revealed that Saul had survived, indicating that Kuzan had indeed shown mercy towards his friend.
Sakazuki
[
]
Kuzan detests fellow Admiral
Sakazuki
, because the latter follows the policy of "Absolute Justice" to a deadly degree. This disgust dates back many years, as during the time when both were still Vice Admirals, Sakazuki killed innocent
Ohara
civilians to ensure that none of the archaeologists escaped the Buster Call, causing Kuzan to call him a fool for overdoing things.
Following Sengoku's resignation, Admiral Aokiji was strongly opposed against Admiral Akainu becoming
Fleet Admiral
and fought him for the position, even though Kuzan himself originally had little interest in it. They battled for 10 days, but Kuzan was defeated, and he resigned from the Marines rather than serve under Sakazuki.
Nonetheless, he was not above telling Smoker to warn Akainu about the danger Doflamingo posed to the new Marine Headquarters, showing a degree of concern for the well-being of the Marines, despite disagreeing with Akainu's ideals.
Smoker
[
]
Kuzan treats Smoker after being defeated by Doflamingo.
Kuzan is also acquainted with
Smoker
, since he mentioned his message given to him about Luffy, though Kuzan chose not to give it, as he thought it was stupid.
They were also talking together in his office about Smoker's transfer to
G-5
.
In the
Punk Hazard Arc
, he even goes as far as to call the
Vice Admiral
his friend after saving him from
Donquixote Doflamingo
.
Sengoku
[
]
Sengoku
seems to trust and respect Kuzan well enough to lead the Marines since he nominated him to be Fleet Admiral.
World Government
[
]
During his time with the Marines, Aokiji was loyal to the World Government. He did his best to follow the government's commands, but at times found his own ideals in opposition to his orders. Even as he completed his assignments, he would sometimes exhibit a sense of mercy and honor that other World Government officials did not. Similar to many of his colleagues (for example,
Jaguar D. Saul
and
Smoker
), after witnessing the senseless massacre of innocent people, Aokiji have come to realize the depths to which the World Government will sink to fulfill their agendas. His awareness of the World Government's corruption and the Marines's inability to oppose it has ultimately led Kuzan to piracy as he directly opposed the World Government by joining the Blackbeard Pirates.
Seven Warlords of the Sea
[
]
Kuzan also seems to have some kind of grudge against
Crocodile
(if not all of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
). After sparing Luffy's life, Aokiji says, "With your defeat of Crocodile, we'll just call it even." Kuzan, however, did apologize (albeit sarcastically) to
Jinbe
for freezing the ocean to prevent escape.
He also stopped
Donquixote Doflamingo
from killing Smoker on Punk Hazard.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Aokiji was first encountered by the
Straw Hat Pirates
immediately following the conclusion of the Davy Back Fight and the fight against
Foxy
the Silver Fox. Initially, Aokiji stated that he was not there to arrest or execute the Straw Hats, saying that he was merely there to view their progress, but also went on to say that with the collective of mavericks garnered amongst them coupling with their past exploits, pooled bounties, growing strength and future potential. In spite of his grand experience with pirates of all kinds, they deeply terrified him. However, just as the Straw Hats were about to leave, Aokiji appeared to have a change of heart, and announced that he was there to arrest
Nico Robin
on the account of understanding the forbidden Poneglyph text/language and for being the only survivor of Ohara. The Straw Hats attempted to protect her, but Aokiji soundly defeated all of them, including Luffy twice, but he mercifully let them live due to owing a debt to the
pirate captain
's grandfather and out of curiosity as to how they would survive against the increasingly daunting odds in the Grand Line. This fated encounter in turn prompts the crew to realize that they would need to start taking the grave dangers and foes that lie ahead more seriously.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Kuzan has also helped the Straw Hat Pirates by giving them information about his former admiral and mentor
Z
's plans to destroy the New World. He also protected the pirates from an armada of Marines led by Kizaru by creating an ice wall to cut them off from Z.
Concludes non-canon section.
Nico Robin
[
]
Kuzan shows some disappointment in the fact that Nico Robin had taken the path of piracy and had not changed her life for the better (although the government did have a bounty put on her, making it difficult to live a normal life). It is also revealed that Kuzan and Nico Robin share a past as when he was a Vice Admiral, he was forced to freeze his good friend, former Vice Admiral Jaguar D. Saul, due to the latter refusing to participate in the Ohara massacre. As it happened, Saul was also Robin's best friend at the time, and it became a very traumatic moment for the little girl, who is fearful of Kuzan to this date. As a testament to the giant's friendship, Kuzan allowed Robin to escape from Ohara, but he warned her that should they ever cross paths again, he would be her enemy, and he would attempt to arrest or even kill her.
However, later, he seemed to retain some concern for her well-being, as he was relieved to see her finally find a place to belong with the Straw Hat Pirates. The two did manage to encounter one-another during the post-Enies Lobby celebrations, but Aokiji decided against action, and even encouraged Robin to continue sailing with the Straw Hats, remarking they are unlike any of the other crews or organizations that she joined in the past, and they truly understand the concept of "friendship".
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Kuzan is shown to have a grudging respect for the young captain, even though he is a pirate. He immediately recognized Luffy's leadership on their first encounter; Luffy chose to settle things with him in a one-on-one duel, rather than jeopardize the entire crew being wiped out by allowing them to get involved. He felt he owed Luffy for his defeat of
Crocodile
, but it also indebted to his grandfather
Vice Admiral Garp
for a yet unknown reason. Due to Kuzan's power, the fated conflict between him and the Straw Hats prompted Luffy to be less naive towards future conflicts;
for this reason, Kuzan served as the starting point for Luffy to push his strength beyond his limits. Kuzan is shown to be impressed by Luffy's quick rise in infamy; Luffy and the Straw Hats escape from the Marines' strongest battle force; Luffy being able to escape Impel Down, bringing several notorious convicts with him to the
Summit War of Marineford
; and Luffy being able to penetrate Marine Headquarters a second time to ring the Ox Bell.
Others
[
]
Camel
[
]
Camel
is Kuzan's traveling companion, having met him after leaving the Marines. The duo is said to be very compatible.
Blackbeard Pirates
[
]
Kuzan drinking with the Blackbeard Pirates.
After the timeskip, Kuzan became a member of the Blackbeard Pirates,
acting as the captain of the tenth ship. While their first meeting had some ups-and-downs, where
Laffitte
suggested they kill him for his Hie Hie no Mi powers,
Marshall D. Teach
recruited him with some words of encouragement.
Some members like
Jesus Burgess
are not so quick to trust Kuzan because of his past as a marine, but Blackbeard pays it no mind.
He has a rather casual relationship with the crew, referring the Admiral by his given name without any honorifics.
Kuzan has shown to be effective in working with his fellow captains to take down enemies as shown when he subdued Garp with the help of his fellow Captains.
Being of such high rank and reputation, the lower ranking members of the Blackbeard Pirates greatly admire Kuzan, and refer him by his Marine alias despite his disconnection with the organization.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
While an
Admiral
, Kuzan held power over the thousands of lower-ranked Marine personnel, his status being just below
Fleet Admiral
Sengoku
's. He could command fleets, have a say on the overall strategy of the organization, and issue special orders, like the enactment of a
Buster Call
on any island he deemed a threat or delegate to lower-status
government agents
the same privilege.
With his resignation, of course, came the forfeiture of any such powers.
Nonetheless, despite the outward indolence that Kuzan showed in casual situations, holding such a high military office bore out his leadership prowess. Further attesting to these skills as a leader, plus his charisma, is the support Kuzan enjoyed from among subordinate ranks to become Fleet Admiral following the
Summit War
, as well as having Sengoku himself personally select him as his successor (as opposed to
Akainu
's backing coming mainly from governmental dignitaries).
As a combatant, Kuzan with his fellow Admirals was held as the "Greatest Military Power" that the
World Government
and Marine Headquarters could bring to bear,
making him one of the world's strongest people. Being one of the Marines' chiefest assets, his departure had a notably detrimental impact on their force,
with
one
of the
Five Elders
referencing his "enormous power" in his dismay over Kuzan's affiliation with the
Blackbeard Pirates
.
According to
Brannew
, Kuzan's strength as a Marine "hero" was not gifted at birth but rather built up by training, as was the case with
Monkey D. Garp
. Still, since his early days in the Marines, Kuzan seemed quick to learn everything that instructors would teach him, leading him to start training under Garp as he subsequently rose through the ranks.
During Kuzan's time as a
Vice Admiral
over two decades ago, his strength was already considered abnormal for someone of his rank, as illustrated by
Jaguar D. Saul
, an extremely powerful
giant
who used to be a vice admiral himself, being taken down by Kuzan easily with a mere two attacks, after having fled at Kuzan's mere sight.
The first hint given to Kuzan's reputation involved
Nico Robin
; though arguably the most well-composed of the
Straw Hats
, she completely panicked and lost her grip in the Admiral's presence, this relating to her
childhood trauma
(despite Kuzan having spared her as a child).
During his first encounter with the Straw Hats on
Long Ring Long Land
, Kuzan effortlessly overwhelmed their
top
three
fighters
in a single moment, followed by him incapacitating Robin without her able to retaliate in any measure, and subsequently dealt a swift but crushing defeat to Monkey D. Luffy in a duel that saw the rookie pirate completely at the Admiral's mercy, unable to lay so much as a scratch on him (though largely due to having no means to hurt the Admiral's
Logia
form).
During the Summit War, Kuzan's power was well-exemplified against the
Whitebeard Pirates
, with him engaging
Whitebeard
, the world's strongest pirate, head-to-head and holding his own, albeit briefly until
Jozu
's interference.
He would go on to battle Jozu, one of Whitebeard's most formidable men, and defeat him with relative ease upon exploiting an instant's distraction of his foe, robbing him of an arm and incapacitating him for the total rest of the war.
Ultimately, Kuzan himself emerged from the war almost entirely unscathed, with nothing but a small bruise to show for it.
Against Akainu, Kuzan would prove his then-fellow Admiral's equal in strength. A one-on-one duel between the two saw them meeting one another blow for blow throughout most of the fight, such that it took ten entire days to settle; though Akainu was the one to emerge victorious, both men sustained grievous injuries.
Upon encountering the Blackbeard Pirates a year after his fight against Akainu, Kuzan was able to swiftly defeat several of Blackbeard's officers, including the enormous
Sanjuan Wolf
and other ex-prisoners from
Impel Down
's Level 6, by freezing them up in a matter of seconds.
In the year since joining hands with Blackbeard, Kuzan has become a powerful asset of the
Emperor
's crew,
and with his position of Titanic Captain comes the authority over the Blackbeard Pirates' Tenth Ship.
In particular, Kuzan's knowledge of the Marines' inner workings, including the most secretive organization
SWORD
, provides valuable intel for the crew.
In
Totto Land
, Kuzan managed to ice up and thus defeat
Charlotte Cracker
, one of
Big Mom
's strongest commanders with an
860,000,000 bounty, without coming to harm himself.
When he approached Garp face-to-face on
Hachinosu
, Kuzan began fighting on nearly even grounds against his former mentor who, despite bemoaning his decline in strength, still demonstrated monstrous fighting ability against the many Blackbeard Pirates present on the island, with Garp initially holding the upper hand against the ex-Admiral.
Ultimately though, with the aid of his fellow Titanic Captains, Kuzan managed to subdue Garp and left him on the ground impaled with a massive icicle, slowly freezing up, even though Garp had been more preoccupied with letting his students escape the island than with defeating the enemy.
Aside from combat, Kuzan is shown to have enough navigation skill to be able to traverse the
Grand Line
seas using a
simple bicycle
(assisted by his ice powers to create a track by which to cycle on the water).
Physical Abilities
[
]
Kuzan and Garp exchanging punches.
Kuzan's physical prowess is immense, befitting his former Admiral position. His strength is particularly notable, having developed massive punching power from years of training under Garp since his early marine days. Like his mentor, Kuzan would use retired
battleships
like sandbags ("battleship bags") to train up the force of his punches, while not permitting himself to use his
Devil Fruit powers
or
Haki
; ultimately, Kuzan reached a point where, like Garp himself, he could cave in the armored hulls of ships with the sheer force of his blows.
Two years ago, against the much weaker Straw Hats, Kuzan proved his strength by casually stopping Sanji and Zoro in their tracks using a single hand to grab hold of each, simultaneously taking a punch to the gut from Luffy without seemingly turning to ice, yet not so much as reacting or losing his grip on the former two.
Post-timeskip on Hachinosu, Kuzan showcased power roughly on par with Garp's, at least enough to have an even exchange of blows with the elder Marine that sent both of them flying (though Garp noted that his strength was nowhere near what it used to be).
Attesting to his tremendous endurance and strength of will, Kuzan managed to fight his equal Akainu for a total of ten days before being defeated, and despite suffering grievous injuries (including the loss of a leg) he recovered.
Kuzan's durability, likewise, is impressive. At Marineford, he remained unfazed by a
Haki
-imbued kick from
Marco
that sent him flying with great force
and later a violent, Haki-enforced tackle from the
diamond-bodied
Jozu, the latter of which (coming as a sneak attack) left him only slightly bleeding from the mouth.
When fighting Garp on Hachinosu, Kuzan was able to swiftly recover from being subjected to the latter's powerful, Haki-infused
Blue Hole
attack that slammed him into the ground headfirst, hard enough to make a deep crater,
Kuzan reemerging with only some minor bruises.
When both Kuzan and Garp subsequently exchanged Haki punches to the face that caused a massive explosion and sent both hurtling back,
Kuzan rose up moments later with, still, only superficial wounds on him.
The ex-Admiral is also extremely fast and agile, able to close large distances and jump to extreme heights within seconds (often implicitly aided by his powers, traces of ice being visible on spots he leaps from).
His attack speed is notable as well, with him managing to intercept Whitebeard's
quake-powered
naginata
mid-swing by fully encapsulating its wielder in ice and subsequently avoid a quick, Haki-infused surprise thrust of Whitebeard using the same weapon, by seamlessly opening up a hole in his icy self just large enough to avoid contact with the blade.
Against
Doflamingo
(a
Observation Haki
user), Kuzan proved fast and stealthy enough to sneak up on him, taking his back without the
Warlord
noticing until Kuzan spoke, and thereupon prevent Doflamingo from dealing a killing blow to
Smoker
by icing him up faster, with precision, than he could move his hand, while leaving Smoker untouched.
Otherwise, the Admiral has shown rather acute hearing, able to notice underwater activity from hundreds of meters away
and overhearing
Laffitte
's whispers to Blackbeard amidst loud partying in a bar.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Hie Hie no Mi
Kuzan using his Devil Fruit ability.
Kuzan ate the Hie Hie no Mi, a
Logia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into ice. Compared to most Logia users who, when transformed, can let physical attacks pass through their "fluid" bodies, Kuzan is more easily hit since ice is a solid element. However, he still goes unharmed by enemy attacks that are not infused with Haki; instead of dissipating out of harm's way, his body shatters apart when struck, only to reform as effortlessly as any Logia user thereafter.
Kuzan is able to form constructs out of ice. In combat, Kuzan can create weapons, primarily forming swords and
spears
,
but can also make more elaborate constructs, like a giant pheasant to send flying at enemies.
By imbuing his icy fist with Haki, he can also greatly empower his punches.
Kuzan freezing the sea and a giant sea monster along with it.
On a smaller scale, Kuzan can quickly incapacitate enemies by freezing them solid on contact or from a distance by launching waves of ice,
and may even encase opponents in large spheres of ice to make escape even more difficult.
Aside from potentially suffering dangerous degrees of
frostbite
and
hypothermia
, those frozen by Kuzan are left in a very fragile state, as they body could be shattered by any kind of impact;
however, a person can be freed from the ice if they are thawed out properly and carefully.
On a larger scale, Kuzan can spread his freeze outward over tremendous distances, casually icing over several square kilometers of ocean within seconds of dipping his hand in the water, or turning a pair of mountainous tsunamis into icebergs just as swiftly, using icy beams shot from his hands.
Despite the speed at which Kuzan can flash-freeze massive amounts of water, the ice he thereby forms tends to be extremely thick and able to persist for long periods—several days even.
Kuzan can also bypass his weakness to water and falling therein by freezing it before he can sink below the surface. Not only does this keep him from drowning, it lets him prevent enemies from escaping by sea, by freezing their ships in place, or render the sea a solid battleground for entire armies to fight on.
Even by Logia standards, this ability has impressive potential—when used excessively for ten days straight, it was able to permanently alter the very climate of
half an island
, rendering it a frozen, uninhabitable wasteland with constantly raging blizzards.
Haki

Main article:
Haki
As a former Marine Admiral, Kuzan is a highly skilled Haki user.
Armament Haki
[

Kuzan using Armament Haki.
During the Summit War, Kuzan was seen using
advanced-grade Armament Haki
to negate an extremely powerful
quake shockwave
sent out by Whitebeard, by generating, with his fellow Admirals, an emitted shield combination of their three Haki to disperse said shockwave.
On its own, Kuzan's Haki is shown to be enough to allow the ex-Admiral to have an even exchange of blows with Garp, a wielder of both Armament and
Supreme King Haki
, causing a massive explosion when they struck one another with their Haki-imbued fists.
Observation Haki

Kuzan possesses the ability to use

Weapons
[

Kuzan has been shown to be adept at using weaponry formed from ice, like a hand-wielded sword to clash with another swordsman.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Kuzan was born 49 years ago in the
South Blue
.
Joining the Marines
[
]
Kuzan trains with Garp.
In his youth as a Marine, Kuzan sought out
Monkey D. Garp
to further his training, having felt he learned enough from his previous Marine instructors and surpassed the standard Marine training. He believed he was ready for the next level, so he asked Garp to take him on as an apprentice. Garp initially refused, but eventually, through unknown events, Garp did indeed end up training Kuzan. They trained using "punching ships", the same thing as punching bags, only they trained by punching the bow of scraped ships, leaving large indents in the ships they practiced on. As a rule of the training, they were not allowed to use Haki or Devil Fruit powers, just raw brute strength. During this training, Garp became more casual with Kuzan even talking to him about his
family
.
Even though he joined the
Marines
, Kuzan stated that he never held the
World Government
in high esteem to begin with.
A Storm in the Edd War
[
]
When the Marines learned that the
Roger Pirates
and the
Golden Lion Pirates
were about to do battle in the
Edd War
, three years before the death of the Pirate King, Kuzan was in
Marineford
and walked with
Monkey D. Garp
,
Jaguar D. Saul
,
Sakazuki
and
Tsuru
. He told Garp that him turning down another promotion was really something cool.
Ohara Incident
[
]
Kuzan was among the Marine forces present during the incident at
Ohara
that prompted the Marines to put a
bounty
on
Nico Robin
's head. At that time, Vice Admiral Kuzan appeared to have been responsible for the deployment of
CP9
in pursuit of the "criminal" archaeologists of Ohara.
He was one of the five Vice-Admirals taking part in the
Buster Call
on Ohara. During the attack, the destruction of the civilian fleet, ordered by Vice Admiral Sakazuki (who was later promoted to Admiral and later Fleet Admiral), came as a complete shock to Kuzan. The original order that had been sent was for all those who had not been involved with the Ohara scholars and the
Poneglyph
, to be safely transported off the island. However, Sakazuki's course of action was the complete opposite.
Kuzan gives young Robin a warning.
Kuzan then froze Jaguar D. Saul using
his Devil Fruit powers
. He helped Robin to escape via the use of his Devil Fruit powers, by freezing a trail in the ocean for her boat to sail safely through. Before her departure, he warned her that he is not her ally despite this one assistance, and would be quick to come after her, if he ever felt that she was a threat.
As part of his plot in saving Robin, Kuzan froze
Spandine
's ship's rudder, but regardless, Spandine saw Robin and had her marked for capture. Kuzan seemed troubled when he was present at the meeting between the Marines and Spandine.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Sometime after being promoted to Admiral, Aokiji came across an island being rocked by a massive disturbance. He looked around the island, seeing the ruins of a large city and a small boy named
Grount
huddled nearby. Wondering if Grount was responsible for the destruction, Aokiji watched as Grount revealed his monstrous left arm, which he could not control. Grount unwillingly attacked Aokiji with his left arm, but the Admiral dodged it before finally relieving the boy of his suffering by freezing his arm and knocking him out.
Aokiji took Grount into the Marines, where he was given a metal attachment to control his left arm. Aokiji trained Grount alongside
Bonham
and
Zappa
but kept him out of the front lines until he could master his power.

Water 7 Saga
[
]
Long Ring Long Land Arc
[
]
Twenty years later, when the
Marine Headquarters
discovered that Aokiji was missing, they informed the
Five Elders
about the situation. The Five Elders were upset with Aokiji's action and remarked that he should watch his rank.
Aokiji went to
Long Ring Long Land
, having tracked Robin there. Standing in front of
Tonjit
's house, he slept.
The Straw Hats find Aokiji in Long Ring Long Land, causing fear in Robin.
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
finished the
Davy Back Fight
, they returned to Tonjit with the pirate flag. Gleefully, Tonjit walked to the door of his house, only to bump into the sleeping Aokiji. Aokiji woke up and began to make excuses that he wanted to inspect something. He froze the water with his power to create a bridge for Tonjit to cross.
After the Straw Hats bid their goodbyes to Tonjit, Aokiji lied by saying that he once tried to arrest Robin. He then started to talk nonsense, confusing the pirates and making
Sanji
and
Luffy
angry with him. Aokiji told Luffy that his anger reminded him of his
grandfather
, which startled Luffy. After that, Aokiji then announced that maybe they should just die.
Aokiji decided to test the Straw Hat Pirates by saying that everyone around Robin got wiped out with her being the only person left standing, referring to the actual situation that happened to Robin's
mother
. The truth is Robin only ran away from people who tried to kill her or turn her in. The Straw Hats never knew about Robin's past and stand with Robin against him. Aokiji started to call Robin a demon and an unfortunate woman. He told them that one day they would regret having Robin with them.
Angry and tired of Aokiji's taunting game, Robin used her
Devil Fruit
abilities to break him into pieces against Usopp's wishes. Thinking he was dead, the Straw Hats prepared to flee, but Aokiji returned back in one piece, grabbed some grass and breathed on the grass to create an ice saber. He attempted to strike Robin but was parried by Zoro. The saber was kicked away (and thus destroyed) by Sanji shortly thereafter.
Zoro rushed in attempting to cut him only to be caught by the wrist. Sanji tried to kick him but was grabbed by the thigh. Luffy tried to punch him in the stomach, but when he connected, his hand was frozen. Sanji and Zoro were also frozen on the leg and arm respectively. Nami blocked Aokiji with her staff but was pushed away.
He then froze Robin into solid ice and threatened to punch her into pieces, claiming that the world would be better off without her. Luffy saved Robin in the nick of time, but Aokiji said that they should not try to save her and was going to stomp on her, but Usopp and Chopper managed to save her and drag her back to the ship.
Aokiji freezes Luffy.
Luffy ordered his crew to go back to the ship as he faced Aokiji one-on-one. Luffy tried to send him flying with his
Gomu Gomu no Storm
, but he was quickly frozen up by Aokiji. Having Luffy frozen solid, he realized that Luffy tricked him. By agreeing to a one-on-one fight with Luffy, he could not attack his crew. He remarked that Robin would bring him only misfortune. He then decided not to kill Luffy, saying that he did the
World Government
a favor by defeating
Crocodile
and commented that Smoker's message was too stupid.
As Aokiji left on his bike across the ocean, he noticed that the Straw Hat Pirates were heading to
Water 7
, which is close to Marine Headquarters.
He then called
Spandam
, who was ready to have his
unit
finish a mission and informed him that Robin was heading to Water 7. It was later stated by Spandam (though never shown) that Aokiji also gave him the
Golden Den Den Mushi
at this time in order to summon a
Buster Call
.
Spandam decided to wait until Robin arrived at Water 7.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
After the Straw Hats defeated the seemingly invincible
CP9
, rescued Nico Robin from
Enies Lobby
, and escaped the
Buster Call
, Aokiji was seen again witnessing the aftermath of their raid at Enies Lobby and the Buster Call attack. They had passed his "test" far beyond his expectations. When he was asked by a Marine over the
Den Den Mushi
whether they should continue to pursue the Straw Hats, Aokiji declined, noting the
Marines
suffered heavy casualties already, calling their battle "a complete defeat".
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Aokiji and Robin speaking in private.
Aokiji later visited Water 7 and had a secret conversation with Robin while the Straw Hats were having a party with the Water 7 citizens. He then revealed to Robin that he was good friends with Saul and allowed Robin to escape Ohara because of this friendship. He also said that he intended to have her eliminated by
CP9
, as he had come to see her as danger after 20 years of living as a rogue, but he did not expect CP9 to lose to the Straw Hats. However, when he asked Robin why she did not run from the Straw Hats, Robin told him that she does not want to see them die. Aokiji bid Robin farewell, telling her to live strong, remarking that
Ohara
is not fully destroyed, presumably meaning that the memory and purpose of Ohara live on within her. He then left by appearing to instantly disappear with his ice abilities.
A while later, he was seen leaving Dock 1 on his bike. Sometime later, Robin speculated that he was responsible for excluding all the non-Straw Hat Pirates (outside
Franky
, who joined the Straw Hats after the incident) from the report on the Enies Lobby incident and instead making them out to be innocent civilians who got caught up in all the commotion.
Later, he asked for Garp to lend him a ride on his ship back to Marine Headquarters because riding back there on his bike was "such a bother".
He witnessed the Straw Hats' new ship, the
Thousand Sunny
, leaping into the air to escape and seemingly impressed by it, smiled.
Summit War Saga
[

Amazon Lily Arc
[
]
Following the announcement of
Portgas D. Ace
's execution, Aokiji was summoned to lead the Marines in the battle against the
Whitebeard Pirates
and arrived at
Marine Headquarters
.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Aokiji sat over the execution platform of Portgas D. Ace with his fellow
Admirals
, watching over it.
Aokiji freezing the water at the Marine Headquarter's bay.
When
Whitebeard
's forces arrived and their captain used his
Gura Gura no Mi
powers to create two massive tidal waves, Aokiji freezes them both with Ice Age, then attacks Whitebeard with his Partisan. However, he is shattered by one of Whitebeard's seismic waves, which the Admiral shrugs off. He then froze the bay water of Marineford, which not only stopped all the pirate ships from moving, but also served as a foothold for them. Having reformed himself at some point, Aokiji can only remark at the motley crew that
Luffy
helped gather at
Impel Down
for his attempt at freeing Ace from the Marines.
After Whitebeard is attacked by
Squard
, Aokiji follows Sengoku's orders and freezes
Buggy
and the Impel Down prisoners loyal to him, stopping them from showing the world any more of the battle. When Whitebeard fired off a shockwave towards the execution platform itself, the three Admirals, including Aokiji, are seen raising their hands in order to block the sheer concussive force of the shockwave. Aokiji mutters how slow they are at raising the encircling walls in time.
Akainu
chides Aokiji for his ice being the problem, with
Kizaru
chiming in for the latter to just melt his ice.
Later, when Luffy leaps over the siege wall, with a large piece of broken mast in hand, Aokiji comments on how, despite how far he has come, that Luffy was still not ready to "play with the big boys". When Luffy simply brings the broken mast piece to bear, Aokiji freezes it before it could somehow damage the three Admirals and watches as the frozen piece of wood smashes beneath the assault of kicks almost immediately following it.
Marco attacks Aokiji.
Luffy, having been (once more) prevented from reaching the execution platform, then gets cornered by Aokiji. He comments that he is in debt to Luffy's grandfather but that he has no choice since Luffy himself chose this path of death for himself. He stabs Luffy through his shoulder with an
Ice Saber
and as he is about to impale him again,
Marco
intervenes and shatters the spear with a single kick that knocks Aokiji away from Luffy.
Aokiji is then seen blocking Whitebeard's bisento attack with his Ice Ball. After seeing that he failed to freeze Whitebeard's earthquake, he commented that he did not know that earthquakes could not be frozen. He then got stabbed by Whitebeard's bisento, to which pirates are seen wondering if Aokiji was stabbed with
Haki
and if he was dead. Aokiji told them not to spout nonsense before grabbing the bisento and using his Ice Block Partisan attack. All of a sudden,
Jozu
attacks him and Aokiji is caught off-guard, even bleeding from his mouth.
When Jozu is distracted upon seeing Marco being shot by
Kizaru
's
laser beam
, Aokiji warns him that he should not be getting distracted and freezes his right arm, and then his entire body, forcing him to fall over resulting in his right arm shattering, before commenting that the Whitebeard Pirates are finished. When Luffy unleashes a burst of
Supreme King Haki
, Aokiji is seen shocked and sweating at his power.
Aokiji vs. Ace
After Ace is freed, he attacks
Ace
and
Luffy
, but Ace blocked his attack with his fire. Aokiji is later seen with a solemn expression after witnessing Akainu striking Ace from behind with a
magma fist
. After Whitebeard's death, Aokiji froze the sea once again in order for the pirates to not leave Marineford.
When
Jinbe
tries to escape into Marineford Bay with Luffy and notices that it was frozen over, Aokiji is seen nearby apologizing to Jinbe. As the
Heart Pirates
are leaving with Luffy in their
submarine
, Aokiji attempts to freeze them with an Ice Age, but the Heart Pirates' submarine manages to elude him. After that, he stands down.
Post-War Arc
[
]
He is later seen in his office in Marineford with
Commodore
Smoker
, commenting on Luffy's return to Marineford and the ringing of the
Ox Bell
. The Admiral wonders if the Ox Bell ringing was some kind of message. Aokiji then spoke with Smoker about the Commodore's request for transfer to Marine outpost
G-5
in the
New World
. Unsure of being able to grant his transfer, he assured he would negotiate with Sengoku for approval.
Aokiji was then nominated by Sengoku to be the next Fleet Admiral upon the latter's resignation.
During the Timeskip
[
]
A Fierce Duel and Resignation
[
]
Aokiji vs. Akainu
Even though Sengoku supported Aokiji as a candidate for the next Fleet Admiral, many of the upper brass of the World Government nominated Akainu. Aokiji strongly opposed Akainu becoming Fleet Admiral and fought him for the position.
They battled on
Punk Hazard
, with the fight lasting for ten days.
According to Smoker, the battle between these two was so ferocious that it literally changed the weather of Punk Hazard Island.
Eventually, Akainu ended up as the winner and even though Kuzan survived the battle, he unfortunately did not escape unscathed. He parted from the battle with a staggering level of scars and with his left leg reduced to a stump. Though crippled, Kuzan used his Devil Fruit powers to generate a replacement limb out of ice. Afterwards, Kuzan resigned from the Marines, not wanting to work under Sakazuki.
After Resignation
[
]
After leaving the Marines, Kuzan met a
large penguin
named
Camel
and the two of them became traveling companions.
Donquixote Doflamingo
and
Smoker
have speculated that sometime around the timeskip, Kuzan affiliated himself with the
Underworld
of
Brokers
. Kuzan has neither confirmed nor denied these suspicions.
Teach asks Kuzan to join the Blackbeard Pirates.
One year after leaving the Marines, Kuzan encountered the
Blackbeard Pirates
at a bar in the New World. He got in a fight with Blackbeard's crew and froze them before
Blackbeard
demanded him to undo his powers. Kuzan explained that Blackbeard's crew started the fight, though he agreed to thaw them out afterwards. The Blackbeard Pirates had a drink with Kuzan as he discussed with them about his battle with Sakazuki. The crew then talked about
Hinokizu
and his possession of one of the
Road Poneglyphs
needed to reach
Laugh Tale
, in which Kuzan replied he did not know who he was and that the Poneglyphs give him bitter memories, remembering he took fate into his own hands for his
friend
and
Nico Robin
back at Ohara. Upon hearing
Laffitte
suggesting to Blackbeard that they should kill him and steal his Devil Fruit power, Kuzan became furious. Blackbeard apologized and said he had no intention of doing so, and instead wanted Kuzan to join the crew. Although Kuzan was at first irritated at their request, Blackbeard mentioned that Kuzan is no longer with the World Government and can make his own choices, while pointing out that he and his crew seek to fulfill their own interests. In the end, Kuzan accepted the offer and became one of Blackbeard's Ten Titanic Captains, leading the tenth ship of the pirate fleet.

One Piece Film: Z
[
]
Kuzan first appeared near
Firs Island
on his bicycle, watching an explosion caused by the fight between Z and Borsalino. He then left after asking himself what the Marines were doing.
In
Secon Island
's springs, he met Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and
Brook
. After he calmed them down by saying that he wasn't out to capture them, he warned them of Z's power and his mission to destroy the
New World
. Brook did not recognize him, but panicked when they told him in that he was an Admiral. Kuzan reassured them he was not there to capture them and had given up being an Admiral.
Brook asked what he was then, with Kuzan finding being questioned bothersome. He thought on the question and was unable to think of a proper answer confusing them further. However, he told them again he was not their enemy anymore and reminded them if he was, he would not be in a hot spring where he could not use his powers. As Kuzan got out of the water, the Straw Hats saw his battle-scarred body and his missing leg that he regrew with his ice powers. He merely said he got carried away, when explaining this. Kuzan and the Straw Hats were seen making their way to port, as he talked about the great age of pirates. He pondered to himself if pirates were made from the One Piece existing, or if the One Piece existed because of the pirates. Kuzan looked out to sea, telling them how when some follow their dreams, it could lead to pain and sadness of others. He told them that Z planned to destroy piracy by destroying the One Piece. He had chosen to follow Z's journey but is unsure what actions he himself must take. He then departed, telling Luffy he would find Z on the island.
Kuzan confronting his former instructor.
After Luffy's second battle with Z, Kuzan met his former instructor. Kuzan gave him a bottle of wine and prepared to fight him but chose not to and just walked away. He told Z he used to drink that because of him, looking up to him. He told Kuzan to not lecture him, and he would go forward with his plan no matter what. Kuzan told him he might die, as Z responded that was no problem if he could rid the world of evil. Z told him to step aside, and the next time they meet they would share drinks together. Kuzan and Z faced each other, but each side unwilling to fight one another as enemies. Kuzan backed down and left Z to his machinations.
Later, he met with the Straw Hat crew again and explained Z's plan to use the
Dyna Stones
to destroy all the three
Endpoints
and then release the Grande Imbuto, which would destroy the New World and everyone in it, pirates and civilians alike. Now that two of the Endpoints had been destroyed, Z is about to go to the last one, Piriodo, and unless the Straw Hats stop him, the Pirate Era would end. The Endpoints had been considered a legend; with most thinking it was nonsense. The government covered up the truth about them, to dissuade pirates from using it. That only the World Government and highest-ranking officers of the Marines knew about it. He laments that it was an Admiral abusing this knowledge above all else. He reminded them that he was not doing this out of power, but to punish pirates.
Luffy remains undeterred despite being defeated twice by Z, vowing to chase him down and get his hat back. If he let Z keep his hat, he could never face Shanks or be worthy of the Pirate King title. Kuzan then gave the crew an Eternal Pose leading to Piriodo. Nami asked why he was helping them, as he ignored the question and warned them that their journey would be very dangerous. If they lost to Z, they would be destroyed along with the New World. Or, if they won, they would be attacked by the Marines. With that said he left them to their own fates. The crew began making their preparations to leave, as Kuzan and Robin shared a small moment.
Kuzan at Z's grave.
Kuzan was then seen watching Z and Luffy's final battle. He later helped his former instructor to protect
Ain
,
Binz
, and the Straw Hat Pirates from Borsalino's fleet attack by creating an ice wall so that Z could fight to his heart's content. He was later seen at Z's grave, telling Ain and Binz that he died like he wanted to.

He eventually arrived shortly after the conflict between
Doflamingo
and the
G-5
Marines. Before Doflamingo could deliver the killing blow to
Smoker
, Kuzan suddenly appeared, claiming that the Vice Admiral was his friend.
Doflamingo ignored Kuzan and attempted to finish off Smoker, but the former Admiral froze Doflamingo solid. The
Warlord
freed himself from the ice and walked away with
Buffalo
and
Baby 5
, having no interest in fighting Kuzan. After this, Smoker discussed with Kuzan about the latter's current status. Smoker also wondered if he had some kind of connection to the
Underworld
. Kuzan stated he was still himself, seemingly reassuring Smoker. He then told Smoker to be wary of Doflamingo and to ask the Fleet Admiral to dispatch the Admirals as soon as possible. He also asked the G-5 Marines to not reveal his presence there, to which they agreed.

Kuzan with Blackbeard while discussing on what to do with Koby.
Kuzan was later present at
Hachinosu
after
Koby
was abducted by the
Blackbeard Pirates
and overheard
Teach
's plans with Koby. After hearing Koby was part of
SWORD
, he explained SWORD's nature to Teach and the Captains present.
When Garp alongside SWORD and a Marine squad invaded Hachinosu to rescue Koby, Kuzan appeared in front of them, freezing
Hibari
, stating he could not let Koby escape due to his captain not being thrilled about the escape. He then remembered when Teach approached him on an island about joining his crew, effectively offering him the choice to be free and chase his own interests under his flag. As Garp then demanded from him to unfreeze Hibari, set Koby free and rejoin the Marines, Kuzan stated he could not grant any of these wishes. He then attacked Garp with
Ice Ball
, but Garp broke free easily and smashed Kuzan into the ground with
Blue Hole.
The Titanic Captains capture Garp.
Kuzan managed to return to the fight quickly and was helped by his fellow Titanic Captains
Vasco Shot
,
Avalo Pizarro
and
Shiryu
. After Shiryu managed to grievously wound Garp, Kuzan told his underlings to stand aside as he knew they were still no match for his former mentor even in his weakened state. As the two continued to fight Kuzan remember how Garp lamented to him how his son Dragon and grandson Luffy became a revolutionary and pirate respectively and seeing how Kuzan himself turned out, he commented that Garp has a habit of raising enemies, with Garp simply saying he was done with him as the two clashed.
Koby managed to successfully escape with the rest of SWORD as Garp decided to stay behind and fight. Kuzan and the other Blackbeard Pirates ultimately overwhelmed the Hero to the Marines, as Kuzan stabbed Garp through the chest with a huge icicle. Kuzan and his crewmates then converged around Garp.
Following their fight, Kuzan listened to
Vegapunk
's pre-recorded
worldwide
message that predicted the earthquake would increase the world's sea level substantially.
When the broadcast was nearing its end, Kuzan looked into the distance coldly as he listened to Vegapunk statement that the fate of the world would be decided by whoever was able to claim the
One Piece
.

Kuzan listens in on a meeting with his crew.
Sometime later, following Teach's return to Hachinosu, Kuzan sat silently as his captain threatened and berated Pizarro for his failure to prevent
Gecko Moria
and Koby's escapes. Teach eventually calmed down after finding out they had gained Garp in exchange, for which Kuzan apologies for, stating that he did try to kill Garp, but he just survived, which Teach shrugs off as Garp was an excellent replacement for Koby as a bargaining chip. Kuzan then sat in on the meeting amongst his crew as Teach plotted their next actions.

Anime and Manga Differences

In the manga originally, Aokiji met the
Straw Hat Pirates
at
Tonjit
's hut after the
Davy Back Fight
. In the anime, he met them much later at a different island and showed his powers helping some shipwrecked passengers as opposed to Tonjit.
In the anime, after the war, Aokiji is seen standing on the bow of a warship vessel approaching Marineford, sneezing the very moment Sengoku mentions him to Kong as his chosen successor. When he enters the headquarters building, a Marine officer approaches him in tears, reporting his inability to capture Luffy. Aokiji merely pats him on the shoulder and tells him that it is okay.
In the anime, during SWORD's raid on Hachinosu, Kuzan is not given any mention as one of the Ten Titanic Captains.
