Diesel's outfit since the meeting in the Fire Tank hideout.
Diesel is a tall man with rather thin legs and a tiny mustache. His most prominent feature is his giant hat resembling a chimney which blows smoke, as well as wheels on both sides of his body which appear to have no real functionality other than him spinning them with his arms when he runs. As a Longarm, he has unusually long arms, with an extra elbow joint on each.
He wears a dark suit with a giant pink bowtie, dark pants, and a dark mask over his eyes.
When he was taken to the Fire Tank Pirates' hideout, he was forced to change his clothes into a lighter suit.
Personality

Like many other characters, Diesel has a unique
laughing style
, following the sound of a steam train: "Shuppoppoppo".

History
[

Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Diesel massacres factory workers to acquire the mythical flour.
Three days before the wedding between
Sanji
and
Charlotte Pudding
,
Big Mom
sent Diesel to an unknown island to acquire mythical flour for the wedding. Diesel attacked a flour factory and massacred the factory workers as he completed his mission.
Two days later, Diesel was with
Charlotte Brûlée
and some of the other of her henchmen in the
Mirro-World
as they prepared to cook
Carrot
into stew. Diesel advocated closing the lid as soon as she was dropped into the pot in order to prevent a struggle. However, the real Carrot was actually up in the attic, and as she threw a rock at
Randolph
, Diesel spotted her. Carrot and
Tony Tony Chopper
managed to ambush the party and knock everyone out except Diesel, causing him to race out of the house to report the incident to Big Mom. However, Carrot caught up to Diesel and put her hands over his eyes, causing him to crash.
Diesel is forced to transport Chopper and Carrot through the Mirro-World.
Afterwards, he was forced by Chopper and Carrot to assist them in traveling through the Mirro-World.
Chopper and Carrot brought
Pedro
,
Nami
, and
Jinbe
into the Mirro-World, and after a brief discussion, they forced Diesel to carry the five of them plus Brûlée, a load which Diesel struggled to pull.
Chopper's group later located
Brook
inside
Big Mom's bedroom
, being held inside the
Emperor
's hands as she slept. After Brûlée tried to alert Big Mom, both Diesel and Brûlée were gagged. After Chopper's group successfully rescued Brook, Diesel was surprised that Brook managed to acquire copies of the three
poneglyphs
.
Later, Jinbe talked to
Monkey D. Luffy
through a mirror shard, and twice included Brûlée and Diesel in his headcount of their team, and the horrified duo quickly corrected him.
Diesel and Brûlée were later taken to the
Fire Tank Pirates
' base, where they were left tied up. The two were cleaned up and given a set of clean clothes. Diesel was shocked when he found out that
Charlotte Chiffon
was taking part in a plan to assassinate Big Mom. He urged Chiffon to reconsider but to no avail.
After the meeting, Diesel fell asleep in
Bege
's body as the Fire Tank Pirates set their assassination plan into motion.
As the Sanji Retrieval Team prepared to charge into the venue from the Mirro-World, Diesel was once again forced to be used as transport.
