Cadenza is an enormous man with a round and thick body supported by small legs. His physique is identical to that of his quintuplet brothers. He has light brown hair that stands in both sides of his head, leaving most of his head bare and revealing several studded bumps on his scalp. He also has a very large beard. He wears a matching black and pink striped short sleeved shirt, bowler hat and pants, and is barefoot, which gives the impression of a prisoner's uniform.
