"Bohemian Knight" Doma
is an infamous
New World
pirate
who worked for
Whitebeard
.
Appearance
[
]
Doma is a man with black curly hair and a beard that seems to have lines that extend to his eyes. He wears a large red headband and a necklace with big light-blue square jewels on it. His neck appears to have a scar on the lower right, and he sports a large and long light brown coat with a wide dark red collar and cuffs, closed by a belt. He also wears loose blue pants tucked inside simple boots.
A monkey is seen perched on his shoulder. The monkey is usually seen wrapping its prehensile tail around Doma's arm; it also carries a flintlock pistol that it fires on Doma's behalf during battle.
Personality
[
]
Not much is known about Doma's personality other than that he is very loyal to
Whitebeard
since he was willing to risk his own life to save
Ace
from execution instead of fleeing through the path that Whitebeard had cleared with his
power
, he was seen cheering Whitebeard's call to follow them. Doma cried tragically after the death of Whitebeard. In the anime, he seems to have a certain degree of respect for his enemies, as he told
Momonga
that it was a privilege to fight him.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Doma has managed to make himself an infamous reputation in the
New World
, becoming a subordinate of Whitebeard. He is implied to be an exceptionally powerful pirate in his own right, as his defeat and surrender to Ace was what allowed Ace to be promoted to the position of Second Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates.
Weapons
[
]
Doma and his monkey fighting.
Doma is a
swordsman
who employs a dual-sword style and is seen fighting with both swords held in a reverse grip (similar to
Kaku
). His exact level of swordsmanship remains unknown; however it is presumed quite high. In the anime, he was capable of fighting on par with Vice Admiral Momonga to stall him. He is also very agile and seems to prefer kicking-style attacks. In
One Piece Treasure Cruise
, his sword style is referred to as
Reverse Two Sword Style
(
逆手二刀流
,
Gyakute Nitōryū
?
)
.
The monkey perched on his shoulders appears to be able to wield a gun well, and serves as Doma's "third hand" for shooting the gun in battle, since Doma is already carrying two swords with him.
He is also strong enough to emerge seemingly unharmed by the end of the war.
