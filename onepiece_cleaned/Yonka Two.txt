Nika has blonde hair, a red-striped tail, and pink fins. Her top is red and her hat matches the red-striped pattern of her tail.
Sanka has orange hair, a blue-striped tail, and light blue fins. Her top is dark blue and her hat is a solid blue color.
Yonka has pink hair, a brown-striped tail, and yellow fins. Her top is brown and her hat is a solid white color.

Personality
[

The five sisters tend to talk in a unique speech pattern. Ichika starts off first by saying a regular statement. Nika then states an exclamatory version of Ichika's statement. Sanka then states the opposite of the original statement. Yonka then questions the original statement. Lastly, Yonka Two then questions whether the original statement matters or not.
Other than that, they are cheerful, friendly, and usually stay close together.

claims that the quintuplets are all very fast swimmers and are well-informed.

Fish-Man Island Arc
[
]
The quintuplets were first seen in
Camie
's house when
Luffy
awakened after he and
his crew
flew through the bubble surrounding
Fish-Man Island
, fell into a
current
, and got separated. As Luffy,
Sanji
,
Usopp
, and
Chopper
got reacquainted with Camie, the quintuplets gave them their dried clothes. Camie then introduced them to the Straw Hats. Afterwards, they went up to
Mermaid Cove
along with Camie and Luffy's group.
Later, they informed Camie about the arrival of the
royal gondola
, and questioned whether or not royalty was on board. They appeared concerned when
Fukaboshi
scolded the
mermaids
in the cove for harboring pirates.
They were then seen in
Coral Hill
when the
royal guards
started suspecting the Straw Hats of kidnapping mermaids.
Later on, they heard the news of the Straw Hats "taking over" the
Ryugu Palace
, and were in disbelief.
After the battle for Fish-Man Island, the quintuplets were seen dancing at the banquet in the Ryugu Palace.
When the Straw Hats finally departed Fish-Man Island, the quintuplets were there to bid them farewell.
