Silvers Rayleigh
,
also known as the
"Dark King"
,
is an extremely powerful and famous retired
pirate
who formerly served as the
first mate
of the legendary
Roger Pirates
,
being known as the "Right Hand of the Pirate King".
He is one of the major figures, along with
Whitebeard
,
Shiki
,
Monkey D. Garp
,
Sengoku
,
Tsuru
, and
Kong
from the times when
Gol D. Roger
, the "Pirate King", was still alive.
After the disbandment of the Roger Pirates and the execution of Gol D. Roger, Rayleigh became a
coating mechanic
at the
Sabaody Archipelago
. Also, at some point after this, he became the husband of
Shakuyaku
and befriended
Hatchan
.
Rayleigh is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
and served as
Monkey D. Luffy
's mentor in the use of
Haki
during the two-year timeskip.
Appearance
[
]
Rayleigh is an elderly man of relatively tall height with a very muscular build and tan skin. Two of his most distinguishing traits are his round glasses and facial hair, which is arranged embattled across his lower jaw. He also has a scar over his right eye, which he has had for many years.
Rayleigh chooses to dress quite simply, usually just in a nearly plain t-shirt, shorts, and sandals. When out in public, he also seems to enjoy the cover of a large silver hooded cloak, though the hood is often down. Underneath these clothes, the old man's body is surprisingly built and very well-toned, a testament to his incredible strength.
When Rayleigh was younger, he had clean cut strawberry blond hair (black when first seen in the anime) and had a moderate amount of facial hair. Over the years, as his hair whitened, he grew it out. He also grew a beard from his initial striped facial hair. During Roger's last year alive, Rayleigh was noticeably taller, reaching almost the same height as his former captain. Regardless of his age, Rayleigh is a muscular man with a broad chest and well-built body.
During Rayleigh's first appearance in Buggy's flashback, he wore a t-shirt with an ornately decorated collar, a motif that appeared even in the long coat he wore during the
Battle of Edd War
. He wore an orange shirt, light-brown spotted bermudas, and simple sandals. He also has a silver-colored coat hanging from his shoulders.
After the two-year timeskip, Rayleigh now wears a black T-shirt as well as his silver hooded cloak.
Later after the
Levely
and his arrival on
Amazon Lily
, Rayleigh wore a yellow ochre top with sleeves and light-green pants with dark green zig-zag like diamond patterns.

Personality
[
]
Rayleigh is light-hearted, casual, and fun loving, much like his captain
Roger
was. In the past, he was shown to have been impatient with the antics of the younger crew members and took the position of crew disciplinarian very seriously. However, he has changed his personality in his older years, becoming much more relaxed even when training
Luffy
.
Though he often has a serious air, Rayleigh enjoys going with the flow and appearing in unexpected places and in unexpected ways, especially given his status and age. He often comments on his age and how his body "does not work the way it used to", much like
Garp
.
Rayleigh is not often headstrong, looking before he leaps and taking time to plan ahead before taking action, although he does not hesitate to act if needs be. Even when entering into an unfortunate or unplanned situation such as engaging a Marine admiral in combat or having his ship sink in the Sea King infested waters of the Grand Line, Rayleigh remains completely calm, pushing forward through adversity with no hesitation. However, Rayleigh has something of a fatherly side to him. This is shown when it comes to Luffy and Hancock, and when pushed, Rayleigh is capable of anger when provoked. When Blackbeard invaded Amazon Lily and tried to kill Hancock, Rayleigh stared furiously towards him, even referring him as a brat whom he did not like.
He is typically open and talkative, and like
Whitebeard
, seems to enjoy talking about the past and its great times, as well as the good old days of their near-bygone era. In spite of this, he appeared reluctant to get into the darker topic of the
Void Century
. He was willing to divulge the whole truth to Nico Robin if she wished, but she declined his offer. Like Whitebeard, he is also aware of his own limitations that he is far past his prime. In spite of his legendary status, Rayleigh admitted he would be no match for Blackbeard in a straight up fight at his age and was gambling on his reputation to scare him off.
As stated by
Shakky
, he loves alcohol and women, which he proved when he is first introduced saving
Camie
from being mistreated by
Disco
while holding a hip flask. He prefers to be called "Ray-san". Despite once being enemies with the
Whitebeard Pirates
, Rayleigh seems to have great respect for their captain, like Roger, and shed a tear for Whitebeard's passing.
Relationships
[
]
Roger Pirates
[
]
Rayleigh's relationship with most of the
Roger Pirates
is unknown. However, he had a close relationship with his captain
Gol D. Roger
. He later became the
first mate
of the
Oro Jackson
, the ship of the man who would conquer the
Grand Line
and be crowned by the world as the
Pirate King
.
Gol D. Roger
[
]
Rayleigh had an incredibly close relationship with Roger knowing each other for many decades, to the point where he was called 'partner' by the Pirate King. After the man gave himself to the
Marines
, Rayleigh was unable to bring himself to directly witness the execution of his closest friend. He toasted a drink to the man with both tears and laughter as the blades passed and downed a glass as his first act in
the Great Age of Piracy
, the Age of Dreams.
Buggy and Shanks
[
]
During their times as pirate apprentices on the ship, their repeated bickering with each other often led to them being punished by Rayleigh.
Despite that,
Buggy
still has much respect for the former first mate of the crew. Rayleigh was aware that Buggy was a pirate in the
East Blue
, which means he kept tabs on him. Twelve years ago, after
Shanks
saved Luffy from being eaten by the
Lord of the Coast
, Shanks reunited with Rayleigh at Sabaody Archipelago and told him about a
boy
he met in East Blue, and after their conversation, Rayleigh became curious to meet Luffy.
Crocus
[
]
He seems to appreciate
Crocus
for maintaining the Pirate King's health during their voyage in the
New World
. Despite the doctor's brief time with them, he considers him a valued crewmate and expressed a desire to see him again.
Kouzuki Oden
[
]
Like the rest of the crew, he held
Oden
in high regard. Rayleigh wanted to help him make
Wano Country
open to the rest of the world though Oden declined the offer.
Family
[
]
Shakuyaku
[
]
Shakuyaku
is Rayleighâ€™s business partner and wife.
When he had gone missing for the previous six months before her introduction, she was not worried because she knew what Rayleigh is capable of. Upon meeting Luffy, she informed him of the other major pirates (the
Eleven Supernovas
) that had arrived on the island around the same time as him. She then told them that they might find Rayleigh at
Sabaody Park
. After the
Straw Hat Pirates
returned from the
Human Auctioning House
, where they found Rayleigh, he and the entire Straw Hat crew gathered at Shakky's bar. Rayleigh trusts her implicitly and he knows her qualities. With her deductions, Rayleigh managed to find Luffy after the war.
Friends
[
]
Hatchan
[
]
Hatchan
is friends with Silvers Rayleigh, after saving the pirate from a shipwreck as a child. Since then, the two were on good terms, but Rayleigh disapproved of Hatchan joining
Fisher Tiger
's
Sun Pirates
.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
After meeting them during the
Human Auctioning House
incident, Rayleigh assisted the
Straw Hat Pirates
on several occasions. He coated the
Thousand Sunny
for free and he also defended the crew from
Kizaru
. After the Straw Hats got back together two years after the Summit War of Marineford, he taught
Nami
the technicalities of sailing a coated ship. When the Marines pursued the crew, Rayleigh helped the Straw Hats escape.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Rayleigh and Luffy bonding during the timeskip.
Ever since Rayleigh had heard about
Luffy
from Shanks, he had wanted to meet him face to face. When Luffy found him on the
Sabaody Archipelago
, he was excited about hearing stories about Gol D. Roger. The more they talked, the more amused Rayleigh felt as he compared Luffy's demeanor to his old captain just as Shanks had. He, like Shakky, has great expectations for him after Luffy stated his belief that the
Pirate King
has the most freedom on the sea. After the war at Marineford, he swam across the
Calm Belt
to reach
Amazon Lily
, where Luffy had been recuperating from his injuries and from the loss of
Ace
. From there, he helped Luffy break into Marineford with
Jinbe
in order for him to send the secret message to his crew. Rayleigh also mentored Luffy on how to master all three different forms of
Haki
over the course of a year and a half. Luffy strongly respected Rayleigh as a teacher as he was even willing to endure hunger as punishment.
After the two-year timeskip, it is apparent that both of them became close from their training together. As he headed towards
Thousand Sunny
, Luffy shouted to Rayleigh that he would become the Pirate King, leaving Rayleigh with a smile and tears in his eyes. Rayleigh himself later proudly proclaimed Luffy as his pupil to the
Marines
. When Luffy set sail, Rayleigh compared his late captain to Luffy, claiming that destiny is slowly but surely taking shape, and that Luffy has become a man well fit to wear that
Straw Hat
.
Jinbe
[
]
Rayleigh also seems to have developed a friendship with the former
Warlord of the Sea
,
Jinbe
. At first, Jinbe could not believe his eyes when he saw Rayleigh in Amazon Lily. He took part in stealing a Marine ship, circling around Marineford, and the ringing of the Ox Bell.
Boa Hancock
[
]
Due to her hellish experience at the hands of the
World Nobles
,
Hancock
has a bitter hatred towards all men. However, Rayleigh is one of the few exceptions to this hatred since he helped Hancock and her sisters return to Amazon Lily after they escaped from
Mary Geoise
. While her sisters were shocked to see Silvers Rayleigh on Amazon Lily, Hancock remained single-minded about Luffy, only realizing later that Rayleigh was there. Hancock also permitted him to stay in Amazon Lily. Later, after parting ways with Jinbe, Hancock took Luffy and Rayleigh to
Rusukaina Island
for Luffy's special training. She said she would bring food for Luffy every day from Amazon Lily. When Rayleigh told her that no women would be allowed on the island during Luffy's training, she was furious but calmed down when Rayleigh told her that it was all for Luffy's own good. After the abolition of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, both he and
Shakuyaku
would go to
Amazon Lily
to help out the
Kuja
where he would run into
Blackbeard
, attacking the island and making a deal with him and the
Marines
, for Hancock to reverse her
devil fruit
effect and then everyone leave afterwards.
Gloriosa
[
]
Gloriosa
is good friends with Rayleigh and Shakky. In the past, specifically during the
God Valley Incident
they were enemies on opposing crews, however they eventually became close friends as Rayleigh is one of the few (if not only) people who refer to her by her birth name, Gloriosa. Before her return to Amazon Lily, Gloriosa lived with Rayleigh and
Shakky
on Sabaody Archipelago while sheltering the
Gorgon Sisters
after their escape from the World Nobles.
Enemies
[
]
World Government
[
]
Rayleigh is an enemy of the
World Government
. He is one of the few people who know the true history and was willing to tell Robin about the
Void Century
, but she denied wanting to know further. The Government considers such people a great threat.
Marines
[
]
In the past, Rayleigh and the other Roger Pirates encountered several
Marines
, especially
Monkey D. Garp
. The fact that he was a member of one of the strongest pirate crew made him a formidable enemy of the Marines. When Rayleigh fought Kizaru, he told him that if he were to get rid of his wanted poster, he could go into peaceful retirement. This means that Rayleigh still has an active bounty, though the amount has yet to be revealed. Kizaru replied that Rayleigh's bounty cannot simply be forgotten, as being a pirate, especially a Roger Pirate, carries the crimes throughout one's entire life.
Whitebeard Pirates
[
]
As a member of the Roger Pirates, Rayleigh had a rivalry with the
Whitebeard Pirates
. Nevertheless, as with his captain, Rayleigh has great respect for
Edward Newgate
and even shed a tear for the man's death at the pinnacle of the
Summit War of Marineford
.
Chinjao
[
]
Chinjao
apparently holds a grudge against Rayleigh, as when Luffy reveals Rayleigh is the one who taught him to control Haki, Chinjao expressed displeasure to know the Pirate King's right hand still lives.
Blackbeard
[
]
Even when Rayleigh first met
Marshall D. Teach
years ago back when he was still a member of the Whitebeard Pirates, while both the Roger and Whitebeard Pirates were rivals, despite Rayleigh having some respect for Whitebeard's crew, Teach was the only member on that crew to whom Rayleigh despised. This hatred would grow, for not only in Blackbeard's actions in killing his former captain, but also for stealing Whitebeard's powers and claiming his territories for his own. Rayleigh continued to despise Blackbeard even more after the latter invaded
Amazon Lily
and tried to kill Boa Hancock. While Rayleigh was successful in scaring off the Emperor and foiling his plan, Rayleigh admitted he would not win if he fought Blackbeard head on.
Due to Teach's original role as an apprentice pirate on the Whitebeard Pirates, Rayleigh mockingly called him "Whitebeard's Cabin Boy" when he confronted the latter at Amazon Lily.
Other
[
]
Vegapunk
[
]
Although the two have never met each other, Rayleigh considers Vegapunk a fool for revealing many secrets about the Void Century to the world, which he considers something that people of their age should not talk about as it is something that people of the younger generations should figure out for themselves.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the former "Right Hand of the Pirate King", Rayleigh is an extremely skilled and powerful combatant. Despite his old age,
Shakuyaku
stated that he was "100 times stronger" than all of the
Eleven Supernovas
by the time they first arrived on the
Sabaody Archipelago
.
In his younger days with Gol D. Roger, Rayleigh participated in many battles against the
Marines
,
Whitebeard Pirates
and the
Rocks Pirates
, making him a true veteran and one of the most experienced pirates in the world. He also commanded the rest of Roger's crew as his first mate and held several duties, like supervising his subordinates, including the young apprentices
Buggy
and
Shanks
.
When
Vice Admiral
Garp
was informed that Rayleigh may be on the Sabaody Archipelago, he told his men not to confront him, nor should
Fleet Admiral
Sengoku
be informed. Garp reasoned that the Marines should not confront two legends,
Whitebeard
and Rayleigh, at the same time and even admitted that if the Marines were to make an honest attempt at capturing Rayleigh, they would need to do serious preparation if they did not want to lose countless soldiers in the attempt, a true testament to his extraordinary strength.
His reputation alone was enough to have
Blackbeard
, one of the
Four Emperors
who had spent two years mastering the
Yami Yami no Mi
and the
Gura Gura no Mi
, to retreat from
Amazon Lily
.
Rayleigh's immense battle prowess allowed him to fight on par with
Admiral
Kizaru
, preventing him from attacking the Straw Hat Pirates. However, he himself has admitted that he is not as young as he used to be, and as a result can tire in battle.
He also stated that due to his old age, he would likely be incapable of defeating Blackbeard.
This implies that when he was in the prime of his strength, he might have been able to beat both Admiral Kizaru and pose a serious threat to Blackbeard.
Eustass Kid
himself even states that Rayleigh was a "legend".
Rayleigh is also an expert in the coating business, as he performs such operations for various pirate ships heading down to
Fish-Man Island
,
and he understands the workings of deep-sea currents.
Intelligence
[
]
Rayleigh has an extremely crafty and cunning mentality; he has managed to evade the grasp of the expansive World Government for over 20 years and quickly learned to exploit the slave-trading business on Sabaody Archipelago for personal gain (getting himself caught and sold to a wealthy bidder, before escaping and robbing his "master"). Calm and level-headed at virtually any and all times, he was the individual to break up arguments and disputes aboard the Oro Jackson, as first mate and the right-hand man to Gol D. Roger himself.
Rayleigh knows the "true history" of the world from his time with Roger. However, he has also stated that, as a pirate crew lacking the archaeological knowledge of scholars of
Ohara
's caliber, they could have interpreted that information differently than the Ohara scholars.
However, this is questionable given the Roger Pirates had Kouzuki Oden, who possessed the knowledge on how to read and write the language on the Poneglyphs.
Another noticeable trait of Rayleigh is his incredible perceptive and deduction capability. This is shown when he was (within a matter of moments) easily able to deduce what had happened after ending up on the slave auction stage on the Sabaody Archipelago.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Rayleigh possesses immense physical strength despite his elderly age. He was capable of killing several
Sea Kings
with his bare hands even after swimming to Amazon Lily from outside the Calm Belt.
In the anime, he could throw bullets with extreme force and accuracy to destroy cannonballs fired at him.
Rayleigh is extremely fast and possesses extraordinary reflexes. When removing Camie's exploding collar, he patiently calculated the time when the collar released itself and quickly tossed it away before it detonated.
He could also intercept Kizaru's attack when the admiral was about to kill
Roronoa Zoro
,
and also managed to keep up with his
light-enhanced
speed.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Rayleigh is a tremendously skilled and powerful swordsman with decades of combat experience since his time with the Roger Pirates. He was able to fight on equal grounds with Admiral Kizaru, who himself is a highly skilled swordsman when wielding his
Ama no Murakumo
, and managed to cut and draw blood from the admiral's face by combining Armament Haki with his swordsmanship. This is even more impressive given that Rayleigh has not used his sword in quite a while due to being retired.
He can also create powerful compressed air slashes, as shown when he cut the ground to prevent Marines from chasing after Luffy.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Rayleigh is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki. He is also a capable teacher, as he taught Luffy about each type of Haki and trained him in the basics.
Supreme King Haki
[
]
Rayleigh using Supreme King Haki.
Rayleigh possesses immense mastery in the usage of
Supreme King Haki
, a rare form of Haki that only one in several million people in the world can use. His level of skill is enough to render a specific target or entire crowds completely unconscious, as shown when he knocked out
Shalria
before disabling an entire hall room of hostiles.
Rayleigh's Supreme King Haki was at least twice as potent as Luffy's by the time of the
Fish-Man Island Arc
; Rayleigh could have knocked out all 100,000 of the
New Fish-Man Pirates
opposing the Straw Hats, whereas Luffy overwhelmed only half that.
Most notably, he is among the small "handful" of users who are capable of using the advanced application of this type of Haki, able to "infuse" his body or objects with Supreme King Haki to increase his attack power, signified by thin streams of black lightning emanating from his body.
In the anime, he visibly infuses his sword with this Haki along with his body with notable lightning that incapacitates several Blackbeard Pirates in the area.
Armament Haki
[
]
Rayleigh is a master of
Armament Haki
, which allowed him to kick and redirect an attack from Kizaru,
and hurt Luffy with a simple flick.
He is able to imbue his Haki into certain parts of his body or objects to harden them
and emit his Haki, an advanced application, to repel and injure opponents without touching them directly.
He is also able to use a high-grade version of this technique, in which he channels his Haki into his opponent or objects and destroys his opponent or objects from the inside out.
In the anime, when Rayleigh uses advanced Armament Haki, it is shown as a red-colored flowing aura. In the anime, he was able to block a kick from
Marco
in his
hybrid form
with a single Armament coated finger.
Observation Haki
[
]
Rayleigh is a master of
Observation Haki
. He could sense that there were five hundred creatures on
Rusukaina
who were stronger than Luffy before his training had begun and used it to dodge an elephant's attack with his eyes closed.
When he arrived at Amazon Lily, Rayleigh was able to sense that Luffy was on the island.
He also has knowledge of the advanced application of this type of Haki and how high-level users can see into the future.
Weapons
[
]
Rayleigh's first sword.
Rayleigh possesses a double-edged straight sword, with a cross hilt and a large round pommel, roughly half as long as his body height. When he defended Luffy from the Marines, he used a katana, which he keeps in a sheath.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Rayleigh and Roger's first meeting.
During his youth, Rayleigh stole a ship due to his house burning down and needing a place to live. Sometime after that, he met
Gol D. Roger
, who was impressed by the ship. Roger said that it was a fated meeting and asked Rayleigh to join him. Rayleigh simply laughed at his invitation and declined his offer.
Despite his initial refusal, Rayleigh later engaged in piracy and became first mate of the
Roger Pirates
.
38 years ago, Rayleigh and the Roger Pirates accompanied Roger on the island of
God Valley
to do battle with
Rocks Pirates
and the
God's Knights
, taking part in what would later be known as the
God Valley Incident
.
After leaving God Valley the Roger pirates were partying over the treasures which they stole when they discovered a
baby
inside one of the treasure chests.
28 years before the current storyline, Roger fell ill from an incurable disease, leading the crew to take one final journey together and ventured into the
Grand Line
together. At some point Rayleigh scolded
Buggy
and
Shanks
for constantly arguing over whether the North pole or South pole was colder, and shortly after joined the rest of the crew in a battle against an unnamed enemy ship.
In the
New World
at
Edd War
, Buggy panicked at the potential conflict between two infamous pirate crews: the Roger Pirates and the
Golden Lion Pirates
. Rayleigh was present, and he held
Buggy
back, telling him not to worry. When Roger rejected
Shiki
's offer to become his right-hand man, Rayleigh prepared for battle along with the other Roger Pirates. A battle between the two crews ensued, and a change in the weather allowed the Roger Pirates to sink half of Shiki's ships.
At some point 26 years ago, the Roger Pirates were causing a ruckus on an island. After defeating a group of
Marines
, they learned that the
Whitebeard Pirates
docked on the other side of the island.
The Roger Pirates were then confronted by
Kouzuki Oden
. Rayleigh and
Scopper Gaban
prepared to fight him, but Roger charged in and blew Oden away with a single slash. The Roger Pirates clashed with the Whitebeard Pirates for three days. After the battle, the crews formed a truce and exchanged gifts. The Roger Pirates were later joined by Oden and his family as well as
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
. At some point, the Roger Pirates visited
Skypiea
.
Rayleigh and the Roger Pirates celebrating reaching Laugh Tale.
After leaving Skypiea, the crew's voyage took them to
Water 7
,
Tequila Wolf
,
Sabaody Archipelago
, and
Fish-Man Island
. Sometime later, they left
Kouzuki Toki
,
Momonosuke
,
Hiyori
, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi at
Wano Country
. Sometime after the visit to
Zou
, the Roger Pirates finally reached
Laugh Tale
.
A year before his death, Roger disbanded the crew in secret. Roger was the first to leave and the crew tearfully parted ways with him. They later returned Oden to Wano Country, and they bid farewell to him as well.
Before he handed himself over to the Marines, Roger told Rayleigh that he would not die. Unwilling to watch the execution of his closest friend, Rayleigh toasted a drink to the man with a laugh as the blades passed and downed a glass as his first act in the Great Age of Piracy, the Age of Dreams.
Rayleigh stated that he laughed (and cried and drank) nonetheless upon hearing the message Roger had left the world.
Sometime later, Rayleigh was saved by a young
Hatchan
from drowning in a shipwreck. Since then, Rayleigh has been on good terms with Hachi. He, along with
Shakuyaku
and
Nyon
, also helped protect the
Gorgon Sisters
after their escape from
slavery
from the
World Nobles
. Eventually, Rayleigh became a coating mechanic on
Sabaody Archipelago
and at some point, married Shakuyaku.
When news of Shiki's escape reached Rayleigh, he remarked on it and wondered what Shiki was up to.
12 years prior to the series, Rayleigh met his former apprentice
Shanks
again and noticed the latter lost his arm and his hat. Rayleigh asked him what occurred as he told him of a
boy
that he met in the
East Blue
who had the same passion as his former captain. Intrigued, Rayleigh desired to meet this boy someday.
He had been missing for six months prior to Luffy's arrival on the archipelago.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
One Piece Episode A
[
]
The
Spade Pirates
came across Rayleigh when they needed to have their ship coated in order to reach Fish-Man Island, with the
Masked Deuce
and him hitting it off. Rayleigh then coated their ship, with none of the Spade Pirates, except for
Skull
realizing who he was.
Concludes non-canon section.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
Rayleigh let himself be captured to be sold as a slave, and when the
mermaid
Camie
was brought into the
Human Auctioning House
, Rayleigh discreetly used
Supreme King Haki
to knock out
Disco
, although his fellow slave
Stansen
recognized what he did.
As an auction took place, Rayleigh broke out of his cell and stole the money that people had bid for their slaves before making his way to the auction stage. There, he saw
Hatchan
and ascertained that he and his allies, the
Straw Hat Pirates
, had attacked a
World Noble
to save Camie. Rayleigh then unleashed Supreme King Haki, knocking out most of the people in the auction hall, and he recognized
Monkey D. Luffy
, saying he had wanted to meet the Straw Hat captain.
Rayleigh thanking Luffy for protecting Hatchan.
Rayleigh then grabbed Camie's exploding collar and ripped it off, tossing it aside before it could explode. He surveyed the room and saw that the
Kid Pirates
and
Heart Pirates
, along with the Straw Hats, had survived his Haki blast, and he then turned his attention to Hatchan, thanking the Straw Hats for protecting him. The pirates then headed out of the auction hall, and Rayleigh told the Straw Hats to meet him at Grove 13 later.
After the three pirate crews had fought through the
Marines
laying siege to the auction house, Rayleigh was able to run off with Hatchan.
Robin asks Rayleigh about the Void Century.
Rayleigh and the Straw Hats made it to
Shakky's Rip-off Bar
with Hatchan, Camie, and
Pappag
, and Rayleigh revealed to Luffy who he was and how he knew Hatchan. He then revealed to the Straw Hats what had really happened to Roger, and they talked about
Crocus
and
Shanks
.
Nico Robin
then asked Rayleigh about the
Void Century
and Roger's writing on the
Poneglyph
in
Skypiea
but opted to continue researching for herself after Rayleigh warned about how she might use the information.
Usopp
then asked if the
One Piece
existed, but was stopped by Luffy, who wanted to discover the One Piece for himself. Rayleigh asked Luffy if he really intended to conquer the New World, as Luffy states he will become the freest man on the sea if he is Pirate King. Rayleigh was impressed by his ideology, seeing the similarities to Roger like Shanks saw. Rayleigh then went to coat the
Straw Hats' ship
, not charging them anything in return for them helping Hatchan, and gave them his
Vivre Card
, telling them to find him in three days.
Rayleigh redirecting Kizaru's attack.
A short time later, Marine Admiral
Kizaru
came and attacked the Straw Hats, but before he could kill
Roronoa Zoro
, Rayleigh came in and intercepted him.
Rayleigh tried to see if Kizaru would leave the Straw Hats alone, but Kizaru would not abandon his mission. The Straw Hats immediately started running away, and Kizaru attempted to go after them, but Rayleigh stopped him with a sword.
As Rayleigh sparred with Kizaru, he witnessed
Warlord of the Sea
Bartholomew Kuma
joining some
Pacifistas
who were attacking the Straw Hats and saw as Kuma made the Straw Hats disappear. Kuma then went to Rayleigh and revealed that he was an officer of the
Revolutionary Army
and was acting to help the Straw Hats escape.
Rayleigh watched as Kuma then transported the remaining Straw Hats off the island.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Rayleigh shedding a tear for Whitebeard's death.
While Whitebeard's death was aired at Sabaody, Rayleigh, who had escaped Kizaru's arrest, watched from afar while drinking. He remarked that Whitebeard was finally dead with a smile on his face and tears in his eyes.
Post-War Arc
[
]
After the
Summit War of Marineford
, Rayleigh set off on a ship to
Amazon Lily
. However, before he could even reach the
Calm Belt
, his ship sank in a storm and thus forced him to swim the rest of the way to the island. He killed several
Sea Kings
when he was getting closer to the shore of the island, something which surprised and almost frightened the Heart Pirates who were watching from the shore. When he got to the shore, he remembered
Trafalgar Law
from the Sabaody Archipelago and told them he thought Luffy was on the island.
Rayleigh reunites with Sandersonia, Marigold, and Nyon.
He saw Luffy and
Jinbe
coming toward him. When Luffy asked about his crew, Rayleigh said he doubted they were all back yet. After telling Luffy that Law said to take it easy for another two weeks, he proceeded to greet Nyon, Boa Hancock, and her sisters, whom he had met 13 years ago; he had protected them when they had escaped from the Celestial Dragons. Elder Nyon is an old friend of his, and Rayleigh passed on a message from Shakky. He reassured them that the Marines would not even think to look for Luffy on Amazon Lily and that he was completely safe there.
Rayleigh recalled what Kuma whispered to him back on the archipelago. He explained that Kuma told him about the general direction in which he sent Luffy, which happened to lead right to Amazon Lily. After going back through the events of the war with Shakky, she was able to surmise (correctly on all three accounts) that Boa Hancock was hiding Luffy on her home island, that she was doing so out of love for Luffy, and also as a means of hiding him from the Marines. Rayleigh commented that a woman's intuition was a truly frightening thing. He said he would get to the main reason he came to find Luffy. Rayleigh asked him if he wanted to return to Sabaody, and Luffy replied yes. Rayleigh reminded him of what happened there before, saying that gathering his crew there again would lead to the same result as before. He started to propose an idea he has to Luffy, giving him the choice of rejecting it if he so chooses.
He infiltrated Marineford with Luffy and Jinbe and took part in stealing a Marine ship and circling Marineford once with it. He was on the
Perfume Yuda
, with two
Kuja Pirates
pulling on his cheek. He told Luffy that his crew most likely got the meaning of his message, due to its abnormal nature, and said that he had a hunch that the others would understand the message.

He and Luffy went to
Rusukaina
for special training. Rayleigh told Hancock that none of the Kujas are allowed on the island during the training and that if she was worried, then she should pray for Luffy. Once the Kuja Pirates left, Rayleigh began Luffy's training by mentioning that the island was once inhabited, but the chaotic climate changes and the ferocious nature of the wildlife eventually killed all the natives. As a wild elephant came charging at them, Rayleigh explained the basic concepts of Haki, using the elephant as a demonstration for them. Rayleigh told Luffy that there are three kinds of Haki: Observation Haki, Armament Haki, and Supreme King Haki. He used Observation Haki to dodge the elephant's attack and used Armament Haki to repel the elephant. When Luffy started to understand Haki, Rayleigh subdued the elephant using the Supreme King Haki.
The two began training on the island. Luffy realized that he had seen these techniques before in some form or another during his adventures. Rayleigh hoped to use those two years to teach him the basics of controlling the different types of Haki, as it would take longer with a normal person.
During the Timeskip
[

During Luffy's training, he developed
Gear 4
. Luffy asked Rayleigh on how to improve its attack power, and Rayleigh warned him about the consequences of using this technique.
Rayleigh training Luffy in Haki.
While teaching Observation Haki to Luffy, he challenged Luffy to dodge 100 times while blindfolded or he would not be allowed to eat. When Luffy was attacking blindly, he accidentally hit Rayleigh's dinner, causing him to hit Luffy out of anger and annoyance as Luffy sensed his emotions. During a later conversation, Rayleigh remarked on how Luffy was proficient in sensing the feelings of living things. He also mentioned that there are people who can see a glimpse into the future with Observation Haki and asked Luffy what would he do if he met one of these people.
After teaching Luffy the basics of Haki, Rayleigh informed him that Haki can grow stronger when facing stronger foes.

Rayleigh at Shakky's bar two years later.
Rayleigh returned to Sabaody Archipelago half a year before Luffy. In Shakky's bar, he commented on how strong the Straw Hat Pirates had become. He also finished
coating
the Thousand Sunny.
Rayleigh met Nami, Robin, Franky, Chopper, and Usopp on the Thousand Sunny. He informed them that Luffy had arrived on the island and is about to teach Nami on how to operate a coated ship. He told her to move the ship to Grove 42 and to wait until everyone assembled, saying it was finally time to restart.
Rayleigh went to Grove 46 to check up on Luffy. He also commented on how Luffy strengthened his Haki.
After Luffy had declared that he would be the Pirate King, Rayleigh smiled with tears in his eyes.
As the Marines begin their pursuit, Rayleigh drew a line on the ground with his sword and warned the Marines not to cross it, declaring that Luffy is his student. By doing so, he bought some extra time for the Straw Hat Pirates to escape to Fish-Man Island.
Once the Straw Hats left, he revealed in a conversation with Shakky that a previous owner of Luffy's straw hat was in fact, Roger. After reminiscing about the day, he first met Roger, Rayleigh started tearing up and commented that Luffy is a man worthy of that hat. Rayleigh added that it is not a bad idea to live a little longer.

Anime and Manga Differences

Rayleigh from Buggy's flashback as he appears in the manga.
Rayleigh from Buggy's flashback in the
Digitally Colored Manga
.
Rayleigh from Buggy's flashback as he appears in the anime.
In the manga, when a younger Rayleigh's glasses were briefly seen, they had a circular shape. In the anime initially, they had an oblong shape. In the same flashback in the anime, his scar is missing, presumably because the scar is difficult to see in the manga.
Also, Rayleigh's hair was black instead of the strawberry blond seen in later flashbacks. This changing of a character's design to a more generic one occurs several times in the series, notably with
Marco
.
Rayleigh mentioning his second suggestion to Luffy was not in the manga. In the manga, Rayleigh is the only one who fights the elephant. It was never shown in the manga how Luffy, Jinbe and Rayleigh got back into Marineford. In the anime, Luffy's actions in Marineford are seen, though in the manga they were only explained later.
In the final battle between the Roger Pirates and the Whitebeard Pirates, Rayleigh was shown briefly clashing with Marco, using his advanced Armament to stop the latter's
attack
with a single finger. In the manga, the battle as a whole was little elaborated upon.
