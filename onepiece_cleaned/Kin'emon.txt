Appearance
[
]
Kin'emon's appearance matches the stereotype of samurai found in ancient Japan, with a black topknot and goatee.
At 295 cm (9'8"), he is taller than
Brook
who stands at 277 cm (9'1").
He is also quite muscular.
His eyes are asymmetrical, with his right eye opening more than his left.
His attire consists of a samurai gi that is black and white striped on the left side and orange on the right. Kept on the left side of his torso is a pair of katana with identical flame-patterned sheaths. For footwear, he wears simple geta sandals.
He has the crest of the
Kouzuki Family
tattooed on his back.
Over 25 years ago, he had blonde hair and did not wear it in a top-knot. It was only after Kin'emon became a proper samurai that it started resembling his current hairstyle.

Personality
[
]
During his youth, Kin'emon was a rather brash and rude thug who partook in thievery and assault in order to get rich quickly. He was irresponsible with money, frequently falling into financial debt due to endless gambling and stealing from his childhood friend,
Tsurujo
.
At the time, he was seemingly fine with dying, ignoring Tsurujo's advice to leave his involvement with the
yakuza
and find a normal job otherwise he could get killed (he happily claimed no one would miss him). Still, he had a conscience, which acted once he witnessed the chaos and destruction caused by the
Mountain God
due to his actions, especially after learning that Tsurujo, who had backed him all this time and suffered from the troubles he caused, had fallen victim to the gigantic beast.
He was going to confess for his crime until
Kouzuki Oden
stopped him.
Kin'emon already showed great courage and a desire to protect those dear to him in his early years, something that earned him recognition from Oden. After witnessing Oden taking the blame for  the
Mountain God Incident
, Kin'emon became a devout follower of the shogun's son, claiming that he would die for him. After being encouraged by Yasuie to reform himself for Oden's sake, Kin'emon adopted a proper samurai etiquette and a very old fashioned manner of speech.
Due to his reformed outlook, Kin'emon now expects women to walk three steps behind men and talk gracefully and quietly. He, on many occasions, referred to
Nami
as a shameless, violent and obscene woman due to her careless behavior and felt disgraced when he got hit on the head by her.
Kin'emon seems to follow the code of
bushido
, claiming he would commit suicide if he could, for the shame of being dismembered without dying. Even after being completely dismembered by a "
mysterious ability
", Kin'emon still maintained his pride as a decapitated, talking head. Like Momonosuke, Kin'emon is very stubborn, constantly refusing the help of others and claiming he does not need it, while also denying conditions like hunger and pain out of warrior's pride. Only after nearly freezing to death did he finally forsake his pride and ask for help. Kin'emon is greatly honorable, bowing before Sanji for saving his torso (which was separated from him at the time) and thanking him for his help, stating that he was now indebted to him.
As shown by his constant refusal to accept help from
Sanji
and own claims, he holds a strong dislike for all
pirates
.
This is most likely due to his master
Kouzuki Oden
's death at the hands of
Kaidou
and the
Beasts Pirates
. Similarly, Kin'emon once stated that he cannot stand the sight of dragons due to Kaidou himself being a dragon
Zoan
Devil Fruit
user, considering them detestable creatures and violently harming one at
Punk Hazard
as a result.
He also seems to be very quick to judge things, believing Zoro to be the one who robbed Ryuma's grave after seeing his sword
Shusui
, a national treasure from his country, sheathed at his waist.
Kin'emon's reaction to Nami's cleavage.
Kin'emon has a tendency to be quite perverted in spite of his sexist ideals. Though he seemed to be outraged at Nami's sense of fashion, he still greatly enjoyed ogling at her cleavage
and has used his own
Fuku Fuku no Mi
to manifest revealing outfits for her to wear.
He showed his anger and jealousy at Momonosuke bathing with Robin and sleeping in the same bed with the women of the Straw Hat Pirates.
Since Oden's and
Kouzuki Toki
's deaths, Kin'emon now dutifully serves
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, heir to the
Kouzuki Family
, protecting him from any harm or threat. Kin'emon cares deeply for Momonosuke, traveling to the dangerous Punk Hazard island
and challenging the
Warlord of the Sea
Trafalgar Law
in order to find his young master. Even after being chopped to pieces, Kin'emon's torso and legs still attempted to search for Momonosuke and attacked anything that got in the way. When Kin'emon learned that Momonosuke could have been left behind during an escape sequence, he recklessly rushed through a mass of
deadly gas
just to rescue him, with little regard for his own safety as a demonstration of fierce loyalty.
By his own admittance, Kin'emon is the type of person who does not give up easily when it comes to a certain matter. He was adamant in making
Ashura Doji
their ally once again, despite the bandit's initial refusal to join Kin'emon's cause.
To this end, Kin'emon was not above framing him for stealing from the Beasts Pirates. However, after being confronted by Ashura, Kin'emon realized this error and that he was ignorant of the suffering his comrade had endured for the last 20 years. As the leader of the
Nine Red Scabbards
, Kin'emon knows how to take charge in times of war and rally his soldiers to victory. Still, he may think of himself as smarter than he truly is, which can lead to embarrassing situations as others praise his accidental leadership and strategic feats.
Kin'emon seems to have no knowledge of Devil Fruits, which he considers a form of sorcery (including his own). The same applies for stranger, unusual abilities, classifying them as either ninjutsu or the work of a creature from folklore. He is also unaware of other modern things that are commonplace outside Wano, including dishes like pizza.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Tsurujo
[
]
Kin'emon is
married
to a woman from
Wano Country
called
Tsurujo
. They have known each other since childhood. During their younger years, Tsurujo would threaten Kin'emon if he tried taking her money, but she did it to make him change his ways. She was deeply concerned with Kin'emon's well-being, begging him to quit living as a thug and find a normal job, becoming upset when Kin'emon disregarded her advice by claiming that no one would care if he were to die.
During the
Mountain God Incident
, once Kin'emon learned that Tsurujo had been devoured by the Mountain God, he remembered all the times Tsurujo stood up for him and paid for his antics, furiously attacking the beast so it would release her and showing no concern for his own life if Tsurujo were to die.
Even after being separated for 20 years, Kin'emon is still loyal to Tsurujo and was relieved to hear about her safety from Kikunojo.
Tsurujo herself is faithful to her husband, never once losing hope that he would return someday even after 20 years, as evidenced by the fact she did not seek another husband. Kin'emon was concerned for her well-being when Kaidou started rampaging around
Kuri
, rushing to her rescue once he learned about her presence at
Okobore Town
.
Kin'emon was happy to see Tsurujo again from afar, though restrained himself from reuniting with her because it was not the appropriate time.
During the start of the raid to
Onigashima
, Kin'emon ended up learning about Okobore Town being razed to the ground by
Holed'em
and expressed sorrow and despair. After the raid on Onigashima, Kin'emon reunited with his wife and they both celebrated.
Kouzuki Family
[
]
Kouzuki Oden
[
]
Kin'emon held absolute admiration and respect for
Kouzuki Oden
, the daimyo of
Kuri
. It began with the
Mountain God Incident
that caused destruction at the Flower Capital. When Oden defeated the
Mountain God
, he saved Kin'emon's childhood friend Tsurujo in the process and also took the blame for the beast's rampage. This convinced Kin'emon to dedicate his life to Oden. His loyalty to his lord was so immense that he and the other retainers attempted to steal money from another daimyo,
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, in order to support Oden, who was facing financial difficulties at the time.
That being said, Kin'emon disliked Oden's insistence in trying to sail away from Wano. When the
Whitebeard Pirates
landed in the country, Kin'emon seemingly knew his lord well enough to suspect he was trying to leave with the pirates instead of driving them off the country,
and panicked when Oden indeed attempted to sneak away with the future Emperor.
Years later, when Oden returned to the country as one of the
Roger Pirates
, he remained resolute in his desire to finish Roger's quest in spite of their imploring, which elicited a rude response from Kin'emon and the other Scabbards.
Kin'emon cared dearly for his master and was deeply saddened by his brutal execution at the hands of the Beasts Pirates, being constantly driven to tears when he recalled Oden's demise in spite of his samurai pride. Alongside his fellow retainers, Kin'emon is willing to risk his life to avenge Oden and fulfill his last wish, which is to open the borders of
Wano Country
. When Oden was alive, Kin'emon refused his offer to teach his personal swordsmanship style out of absolute respect. During the Scabbards' decisive confrontation against Kaidou during the Fire Festival, Kin'emon decided to imitate his master's swordsmanship to honor him, and succeeded in performing his most powerful technique on Kaidou.
Kouzuki Momonosuke
[
]
Momonosuke
is his master's son and the heir of the
Kouzuki Family
. As a loyal retainer of the Kouzuki Family, Kin'emon cares deeply for him and always shows massive concern for his well-being; he traveled to
Punk Hazard
, challenged
Trafalgar Law
, a
Warlord of the Sea
and braved through a cloud of deadly poisonous gas to rescue his young master after they got accidentally separated. They both pretended to be father and son in order to protect Momonosuke's identity, so the boy would not be targeted by their enemies, the
Donquixote Pirates
and the
Beasts Pirates
.
Despite stating that he detests dragons, Kin'emon's staunchness for his young lord was greater, not rejecting Momonosuke for being able to turn into a dragon. At Zou, Kin'emon recognized that Momonosuke, despite his young age, did not want to be treated as a child and was glad that Luffy thought of the youngster as an equal.
Despite being master and servant, Kin'emon can become jealous of Momonosuke and is not afraid of reprimanding him for his perverted antics. After finding out that Momonosuke was bathing with
Nico Robin
, he became enraged towards the young lord, telling him to cut off his topknot as repentance, proclaiming him as the worst kid, and cursing him out in his thoughts.
Although the two were not related,
the
Straw Hat Pirates
noted that they both looked alike and shared the same perverted traits, which made the lie about being father and son believable.
Kouzuki Hiyori
[
]
As the daughter of his master, Oden, Kin'emon naturally cares for the welfare of
Kouzuki Hiyori
, Momonosuke's younger sister.
Kin'emon learned about Hiyori being alive from Kawamatsu, feeling tearful relief as he had just assumed the worst due to Kawamatsu's capture. He was even more surprised to learn that Hiyori had grown from a misbehaving tomboy into a well-mannered lady.
Friends and Allies
[
]
Denjiro
[
]
Out of the fellow members of the Nine Red Scabbards, Kin'emon has known
Denjiro
the longest, having been close friends even before meeting Oden. When Kin'emon recklessly attacked the Mountain God for swallowing Tsurujo, Denjiro expressed great worry, telling him to stop endangering his life. Like Denjiro, Kin'emon shared his immense admiration for Oden and pledged to serve him together. Kin'emon also had the utmost respect for Denjiro's strength, believing him to be a powerful ally for the Kouzuki Family's revolution to overthrow Orochi. He had full faith that Denjiro was still alive after 20 years and was sure that he would join them in the final battle.
Denjiro's blind admiration for Kin'emon.
Indeed, when they met again for the raid on
Onigashima
, Kin'emon was surprised to see Denjiro again once the latter discarded his guise as Kyoshiro. Denjiro took advantage of Orochi's trust and joined Kin'emon after freeing the imprisoned rebels in the Flower Capital. Denjiro blindly looks up to Kin'emon and admires his craftiness and leadership skills to the point of not realizing that those tend to be a result of Kin'emon's dumb luck.
Raizo
[
]
Raizo
is a ninja and Kin'emon's comrade. He accompanied Kin'emon, Momonosuke, and Kanjuro on their journey to
Zou
, but got shipwrecked and separated due to their lack of sailing skills. He and Kanjuro were relieved when the Minks reassured them that Raizo was safe and later happily reunited with the ninja.
Unlike Denjiro, Raizo correctly guessed that Kin'emon misunderstood Yasuie's message, and while he was not angry at his leader due to it working out in their favor, he was annoyed that Kin'emon refused to admit it.
Inuarashi and Nekomamushi
[
]
When Oden first brought
Inuarashi
,
Nekomamushi
, and
Kawamatsu
to Kuri Castle, Kin'emon was shocked and surprised at the sight of talking animals, and even questioned his lord about why he would let what were considered to be monsters to enter their domain.
However, as fellow retainers of Oden, Kin'emon views the two minks as trustworthy comrades. In fact, when Kin'emon's group left Wano after traveling through time, their first move was to head to Zou, the homeland of Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, in hopes of finding help for their revolution (following Oden's advice that the
Mink Tribe
were the biggest allies the
Kouzuki Family
had). Upon reuniting with the two minks, Kin'emon commented that he was happy to discover they were alive and later cried once he found out about the extent of the destruction the Mink Tribe endured for Raizo's safety.
Unlike Denjiro, Inuarashi correctly guessed that Kin'emon misunderstood Yasuie's message, and while he was not angry at his leader due to it working out in their favor, he was annoyed that Kin'emon refused to admit it.
Kikunojo
[
]
They appear to be on good terms, as
Kikunojo
respectfully refers to Kin'emon as Kin-sama. Kin'emon trusted Kikunojo to keep watch of the enemy as he, Kanjuro, Raizo and Momonosuke left the country. After a long period of separation, Kikunojo was so overjoyed to see Kin'emon again that she tightly hugged him on sight and blushed in his presence, making him uncomfortable (something Sanji compared to flirting). Kikunojo stayed under
Tsurujo
's employment while Kin'emon was absent, updating her comrade about his wife's well-being.
Ashura Doji
[
]
As fellow followers of Oden, Kin'emon has tremendous respect for
Ashura Doji
's strength, believing that he was the equivalent of a hundred men and an invaluable asset in their revolution against Orochi and Kaidou. However, when Ashura (under the alias of Shutenmaru) reunited with Kin'emon, the bandit leader rejected rejoining their campaign to overthrow Kaidou and Orochi, stating that he did not share the same loyalty the Red Scabbards held for the Kouzuki Family since he only admired Kouzuki Oden. He became disillusioned with Kin'emon and the others for vanishing for 20 years, having lost several of his subordinates to Kaidou.
Regardless, Kin'emon refused to give up and tried to force Ashura to become their ally by framing him for theft. However, Ashura became even angrier after discovering what Kin'emon had done, but was still lenient enough to listen to Kin'emon's apology and pleas due to Yasuie's execution. Ashura then showed Kin'emon and
Inuarashi
the graves of his fallen comrades, explaining the fate of their allies after they had lost patience in waiting for their return. Ashura then decided to rejoin his former team, taking on a friendlier attitude towards Kin'emon.
Unlike Denjiro, Ashura correctly guessed that Kin'emon misunderstood Yasuie's message, and while he was not angry at his leader due to it working out in their favor, he was annoyed that Kin'emon refused to admit it.
Kawamatsu
[
]
When Oden first brought
Kawamatsu
, along with
Inuarashi
and
Nekomamushi
, to Kuri Castle, Kin'emon was just as shocked and surprised at the sight of the young
fish-man
as he did to the talking dog and cat. However, as fellow retainers of Oden, Kin'emon views Kawamatsu as a true companion, comparing his strength to that of a hundred men. Kin'emon also felt sympathy to hearing his plight as an orphan.
In fact, when Kin'emon spoke to him after 20 years, he was more than happy to learn he was still alive and kicking. The comrades soon reunited and were pleased to see each other after so long. Unlike Denjiro, Kawamatsu correctly guessed that Kin'emon misunderstood Yasuie's message, and while he was not angry at his leader due to it working out in their favor, he was annoyed that Kin'emon refused to admit it.
Shinobu
[
]
Shinobu
considers herself Kin'emon's protégée. She contributed to the Red Scabbards' escape after the events of the
Legendary Hour
, much to Kin'emon's appreciation. Saddened by Oden's sacrifice and death, Shinobu asked Kin'emon if she could become a retainer of Oden, to which the Scabbard leader did not object.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Even though he initially scorned them after finding out that they were pirates (having stated his strong dislike for them), Kin'emon started to view the
Straw Hat Pirates
as different from most. However, despite knowing this, he was not willing to break his pride and ask for their help at first. As they further adventured together, Kin'emon came to view the Straw Hats as his biggest allies to free Wano, and by the time they reached his homeland, Kin'emon had become friendly enough to tell them his whole background, as well as share various stories about his late master, Kouzuki Oden.
Kin'emon and Sanji have an interesting relationship, as the Straw Hat cook took pity of Kin'emon's situation as a helpless severed head and decided to bring him along, despite frequently bickering with the samurai. Kin'emon was too proud to beg for help, but at the same time did not repudiate Sanji's uncalled kindness, pushing his luck too far at one point (which earned him a beating). After nearly freezing to death when his torso fell into a frozen lake, Kin'emon finally forsook his pride and gratefully accepted his aid. When Sanji saved his torso from being eaten by sharks, he bowed to and thanked him, stating that he was now in debt.
Kin'emon has since come to greatly respect and trust the Straw Hats, immediately choosing to eat Sanji's food and telling his "son" Momonosuke that they were legitimate allies.
When Sanji was
kidnapped
by the
Big Mom Pirates
, Kin'emon wished to join the
Sanji Retrieval Team
but couldn't due to his obligations in
Wano Country
.
Zoro
and
Brook
have developed a respectful attitude towards the samurai as not only are they all
swordsmen
of honor, but also due to Kin'emon's very own skill and
fighting style
, of which Zoro shows interest in learning about. The three of them work quite well together in combat, being described as a "reliable trio of musketeers" by
Usopp
.
Kin'emon has a somewhat sexist opinion on women. Having been raised in the Land of Wano, he expects women to be modest and quiet. Nami's behavior, being the complete opposite to what he is used to, comes as a reality shock to him. Kin'emon looked down on the females around him, referring to Nami and Robin as "breast-banded lady" and "courtesan" respectively. Due to Kin'emon's perversion, he attempted to give the women promiscuous outfits when disguises for them were needed.
Nami often beats up Kin'emon for his lecherous attempts, not unlike how she usually does to
Sanji
.
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
technically first met Kin'emon after defeating the
Punk Hazard dragon
. Kin'emon's legs were stuck to the dragon's skin, which piqued Luffy's curiosity. Luffy was so impressed by the pair of talking legs that he wished to have them join his crew, constantly playing "centaur" by sticking them to his back. After the events of Punk Hazard, Luffy let Kin'emon and Momonosuke travel with them to
Dressrosa
in order to search for their comrade
Kanjuro
. Kin'emon assisted Luffy throughout the
Dressrosa Arc
in various ways, from providing disguises to helping push against the string birdcage summoned by Doflamingo that threatened the whole country.
Upon realizing they shared desire to defeat Kaidou, Kin'emon requested Luffy to allow the samurai to join their alliance, showing that his trust for the crew had increased. Kin'emon was glad that Luffy viewed Momonosuke not as an important child, but as the leader of a group of great warriors. When the
Nine Red Scabbards
assaulted Kaidou at
Onigashima
, Kin'emon affirmed his utmost faith on Luffy defeating Kaidou in their place should they fail to do so, declaring that the Straw Hat captain would in fact become Pirate King someday. After being defeated by Kaidou, Kin'emon begged Luffy to save Wano in their place, which the young pirate vowed to do as it was his friend's country.
After Kaidou's defeat Luffy showed his respect and gratitude when he told Kin'emon he was welcome to join his crew if he ever decides to become a pirate.
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
After the Punk Hazard incident, Kin'emon developed some hostility towards Zoro after noticing that he held the sword
Shusui
, a sacred treasure from his homeland. He wrongly believed that Zoro was the one who had desecrated
Ryuma
's grave years ago (when in truth, that was
Gecko Moria
's doing). He intended to challenge Zoro to a duel after their mission was complete so he could take the blade to its rightful place at
Wano Country
. However, Kin'emon did praise Zoro for his victory against
Pica
and aided the pirate against the
birdcage
during the climactic moments of the
Dressrosa Arc
.
Kin'emon eventually gave up all his hostility and resentment after seeing how honorable Zoro is and greatly admires his strength and skill. Likewise, Kin'emon agreed to Hiyori's decision to give up one of Oden's
Meito
heirlooms,
Enma
, to Zoro in exchange for Shusui, but not before warning the Straw Hat about the extreme difficulty in handling Oden's blade.
Trafalgar Law
[
]
Kin'emon seemed to curse the
Warlord of the Sea
for separating his body parts when he came to Punk Hazard to rescue his "son"
Momonosuke
.
However, he apparently decided to forget his grudge and temporarily cooperated with him to defeat Caesar Clown. Afterwards, he seems to have completely gotten over it, as they traveled to Dressrosa.
Kin'emon even showed concern for Law when he was shot by
Donquixote Doflamingo
and attempted to save him from the clutches of both
Issho
and Doflamingo.
With the formation of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
, Kin'emon now considers Law, alongside the Straw Hat Pirates, a comrade with a shared goal of defeating
Kaidou
.
Shimotsuki Yasuie
[
]
Kin'emon held immense respect for Yasuie, not only for being one of Oden's greatest allies, but also for his past generosity in the sponsorship of grooming him and his fellow members of the Nine Red Scabbards into fully fledged samurais. Kin'emon took to heart Yasuie's advice and completely changed his brash and vulgar ways.
Even after 20 years, Yasuie still had complete trust in Kin'emon and his friends. When he came across the secret message Kin'emon was spreading through the country, Yasuie showed his willingness to join him.
Once the meaning of the message leaked and Orochi started cracking down on the rebels, Yasuie let himself get captured so he could claim in front of the population that the message was nothing more than a prank that he had invented, saving Kin'emon's plan from failure and giving them a chance to continue the revolution.
Kin'emon was shocked to learn that Yasuie was still alive and tearfully expressed his gratitude for the former Hakumai daimyo's final sacrifice. Kin'emon heavily cried when witnessing Yasuie getting shot down, heartbroken by the death of his second benefactor after Oden.
After learning that Yasuie had prepared a second rendezvous point for his allies to set sail for Onigashima in Tokage port, Kin'emon became even more determined to succeed in the Kouzuki Family's revolution, regretful that he had caused trouble for Yasuie once again and believing that it would be a major shame as a samurai to not live up to his last expectations.
Enemies
[
]
Kaidou
[
]
Because of his role in the Kouzuki Family's downfall, killing Kouzuki Oden and turning Wano into an industrialized wasteland, Kaidou is Kin'emon's archnemesis and the reason for his hatred of dragons. After hearing that Luffy and Law's
Pirate Alliance
were targeting him, Kin'emon was horrified, but withheld his knowledge about him.
Kaidou initially held interest in Kin'emon and the Red Scabbards due to the possibility of them knowing something about
Laugh Tale
from Oden, only to later learn they knew nothing. During his confrontation with the Scabbards at
Onigashima
, Kaidou admitted he had overlooked Kin'emon and the Scabbards' threat since he had never expected them to join forces with pirates. He tried to disencourage the Scabbards by citing the treacherous nature of pirates, but Kin'emon dismissed Kaidou's words, responding that Luffy would outlive the
Emperor
and become Pirate King.
While Kaidou considered Kin'emon and his fellow Scabbards to be inferior to Oden in terms of strength, he expressed admiration for their courage and unwavering resolve, and decided to personally kill them as a sign of respect. Kin'emon expressed disdain in response, claiming that dying at his hands would bring only dishonor.
Kurozumi Orochi
[
]
Kin'emon harbors great hatred for Orochi due to the latter collaborating with Kaidou to execute
Kouzuki Oden
and bringing ruination to Wano Country by setting up countless weapon factories, causing immense industrial pollution to its regions, and monopolizing food supply for himself and the Beasts Pirates. Kin'emon vows to overthrow the shogun to avenge Oden and fulfill his dream of opening Wano.
Orochi deathly feared Kin'emon and the Scabbards, due to his belief and paranoia about
Kouzuki Toki
's prophecy involving the retainers of Oden overthrowing him and Kaidou. As such, Orochi ruthlessly hunted after them, with the intent of defying her foretelling.
During the Kouzuki revolution on Onigashima, Kin'emon met Orochi face to face for the first time in twenty years, Orochi underestimating the Nine Red Scabbards from their heavy injuries from Kaidou attempted to kill them himself, Kin'emon and his fellow samurais ruthlessly decapitated all of Orochi's head, telling the dead tyrant shogun, they do not have time to deal with him, he will face judgment for all his sins in Wano in hell.
Kurozumi Kanjuro
[
]
Even after Kanjuro's betrayal, Kin'emon still pays respect to him.
Kin'emon once believed
Kanjuro
to be one of his most trusted friends and allies. At Dressrosa, Kanjuro left himself behind to let Kin'emon and Momonosuke escape to
Punk Hazard
. Upon Kin'emon's return, he prioritized Kanjuro's rescue over everything else, looking for leads about his whereabouts and searching everywhere for his comrade. Kin'emon was tearfully overjoyed to be reunited with his peer after finding him.
Kanjuro, however, was not who Kin'emon thought he was, being in fact a spy of Orochi. After all their time spent together, Kin'emon never suspected Kanjuro to be a traitor and was shocked at the revelation. Kanjuro admitted that he did not harbor hatred for either Kin'emon or his peers, but fed Orochi continuous information about their strategies and whereabouts as early as 30 years ago, when Kuri was reformed. Kin'emon became murderous towards the traitor and attempted to behead him only to fail.
Upon seeing Kanjuro's true mastery in painting that contradicts the atrocious scribbles he contributed to the Kouzuki Family, Kin'emon expressed more hate for his former friend's extensive deception.
After Kanjuro's defeat, Kin'emon only looked upon the traitor with a sullen expression while reminiscing their time together as companions. Despite being enemies, Kin'emon still paid his respects to his former comrade and left his kasa behind, over Kanjuro's body.
However, while their sentiments led them to spare Kanjuro, Kanjuro did not return such feelings, as he went onto creating a clone of Kouzuki Oden and acted out his personality with such astounding success it caught the Scabbards off guard. This act of cruelty led to Ashura suffering from a devastating explosion, which turned Kin'emon into a murderous rage.
Despite so, and even after Kanjuro attempted a second time to disguise as Oden, which led the Kiku to once again drop her guard as she could not bring herself to harm their savior despite knowing it was a fake, Kin'emon still shed tears when he was forced to strike down Kanjuro a second time.
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
Kin'emon considered Doflamingo an enemy due to his role in pursuing him, Kanjuro and Momonosuke after they got stranded at Dressrosa after fleeing from Wano and separating from Raizo. Doflamingo  had managed to capture Kanjuro (as the latter purposefully left himself behind to allow Kin'emon and Momonosuke to escape), which prompted Kin'emon to search all over Dressrosa for his friend upon his return with the Straw Hats and Law. Like several other allies, Kin'emon took part in slowing down Doflamingo's Birdcage, which contributed to the Warlord's downfall.
Kin'emon was recognized by several of Doflamingo's subordinates, who had become familiar with him through the footage televised by
Caesar Clown
at Punk Hazard. At a later point of the arc, Kin'emon was attacked by Doflamingo himself when the former attempted to rescue Trafalgar Law from the latter's clutches outside the
Corrida Colosseum
. Doflamingo considered Kin'emon one of his targets after the success of
Operation SOP
, branding him with a one-star rank. This meant that anyone who managed to capture the samurai would be rewarded with
100,000,000.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the leader of the Nine Red Scabbards, Kin'emon has a certain degree of authority among the group. As such, he is an experienced leader who can take charge during a crisis and is capable of successfully rallying soldiers to war. The other Scabbards appear to respect Kin'emon as a leader, most notably Denjiro. By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, he was able to seriously injure Kaidou in his
dragon form
.
Before becoming a proper samurai, Kin'emon was nothing more than a thug who assaulted and stole from people, but his strength and reputation were already recognized by even
Hyougoro
, the most prominent yakuza of the
Flower Capital
.
One of Kin'emon's more unique capabilities is his ability to speak through farting. This was convenient since it allowed Kin'emon a certain method of communication after getting cut up by Law at
Punk Hazard
, as his legs had been attached to a dragon's body while his head remained confined in a cell in the
Third Research Institute
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Kin'emon has an extreme amount of superhuman strength, to the point that cutting through thick steel is a trivial task for him. Towards the end of the
Dressrosa Arc
, Kin'emon helped slow down the contraction speed of
Doflamingo
's
Torikago
by pushing against it with his Haki-infused swords. At age 15, Kin'emon challenged the gigantic boar known as the
Mountain God
, survived its violent rampage, and injured it with his katana, making it bleed.
He also possesses an immense endurance to pain and cold; his head alone was capable of withstanding
Sanji
's
powerful kicks
,
while his torso could endure freezing temperatures that a normal person would typically die from, not to mention the biting of a vicious shark. During the
raid on Onigashima
, Kin'emon managed to survive a direct hit from one of Kaidou's
Supreme King Haki
-infused attacks despite prior injuries, although he was left barely standing and unable to fight further.
Kin'emon's body is capable of processing toxic substances that would have easily caused potentially severe illness to others. Caesar's
Shinokuni
also seemed to have little effect on him even after it petrified his body, as he did not receive any sort of medical treatment post-release despite coming in contact with the deadly gas. Even though the rivers, wild animals, and fish of Wano became extremely toxic as a result of the pollution from Kaidou's factories, Kin'emon regularly consumed these tainted foods with no more major side effects aside from persistent diarrhea.
Tactical Skills
[
]
Noted by Orochi for his tactical intellect, Kin'emon is an extremely clever tactician, having been the one to formulate most of the strategies behind the alliance's revolution against the Emperor Kaidou.
At Dressrosa, Kin'emon was the one who up with the idea of disguising Zoro, Luffy, and himself as
toys
with animal costumes to get away from the Marines without drawing attention. Kin'emon was also smart enough to disguise himself as
Donquixote Doflamingo
while searching through the Dressrosa Royal Palace, allowing him to trick
Gladius
without the latter suspecting him of being an intruder.
At Onigashima, Kin'emon would employ similar tactics, camouflaging the members of the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
in uniforms of the
Beasts Pirates
, allowing them to better infiltrate Kaidou's domain and assimilate among his forces while remaining undetected until the time of the confrontation. Kin'emon also made sure that every ship used by the samurai sank upon landing on Onigashima, with the intent of erasing evidence of their presence from the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
.
Kin'emon's strategies, however, are not always flawless, sometimes requiring an extraordinary amount of luck for them to come into fruition. In order to recruit
Shutenmaru
, his former comrade and leader of the
Mt. Atama Thieves
, Kin'emon successfully framed his group for stealing supplies from the
Beasts Pirates
in order to provoke conflict between them, so Ashura would find himself forced to join the rebellion out of survival, but that ended up backfiring when Ashura discovered Kin'emon's scheme. The bandit eventually rejoined the Scabbards anyway, but mostly because of Yasuie's convenient sacrifice. Something similar happened later at the start of the Onigashima raid, where Kin'emon managed to accidentally mislead the alliance's
traitor
because he turned out to be the only samurai in all of Wano to not realize the real meaning of Yasuie's secret message, having overthought its contents and expecting everybody else to have followed the same logical process he did.
Luck
[
]
Though not on the same level as Luffy and Zoro, Kin'emon has exceptional luck, which has worked in his favor whenever he seemed to have had the worst luck. Despite losing Raizo, Momonosuke, then Kanjuro, he managed to find his way onto Punk Hazard, where during a series of events, he ended up encountering the
Straw Hat Pirates
, after Law had severed him into pieces using his
Ope Ope no Mi
, resulting in him earning them and the
Heart Pirates
as allies for the Raid of Onigashima. At the peak of his luck, through Kin'emon's misreading of
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's final message to them and altering their plans, he managed to deceive Kanjurou, who turned out to be a spy and a member of the
Kurozumi Family
, causing him to not only reveal his own treachery, but also managing to mislead the entire opposition in attacking the wrong location. Later on, after being stabbed in the back by Kaidou, it resulted in his lower half coming undone again, same as what happened on Punk Hazard, because Law was not the one who put him back together, allowing him to survive and inform the others, who tended to him and Kiku.
Swordsmanship
[

Further information:
Foxfire Style
Further information:
Oden Two Sword Style
As the leader of the Nine Red Scabbards of Kouzuki Oden, Kin'emon is one of the most powerful samurai of Wano, noted by Orochi himself to be an incredibly strong master in
swordsmanship
. His skills are extremely versatile, able to wield either one or dual wield both his swords with incredible power and precision. Even after getting dismembered into several body parts by the Ope Ope no Mi, Kin'emon was capable of putting up a fight with his legs, recklessly attacking Luffy's party when they encountered him.
His torso alone was able to match
Brook
in swordsmanship, utilizing a two-sword style despite the lack of a head or legs.
Alongside Zoro and Brook, Kin'emon was able to cut down multiple G-5 Marines with great ease and is capable of cutting steel as well.

Kin'emon specializes in a sword style he calls
Foxfire Style
(
狐火流
,
Kitsunebi-ryū
?
, literally "Fox-Fire Style")
.
He is somehow capable of generating, attacking with, and cutting fire with one of his swords. Using this, he had no problem cutting through
Smiley
's pieces (which were highly flammable) and subsequently slash through the resulting explosion.
His fire-enhanced sword slashes are powerful enough to seriously injure a dragon, despite its scales being stronger than steel. Kin'emon's mastery of this sword style was great enough to split apart even Kaidou's
Bolo Breath
which has immense firepower.
He is also able to generate flames to safely cauterize wounds.

Moreover, Kin'emon is capable of emulating Oden's signature
Oden Two Sword Style
style, to perform one of his techniques albeit being significantly less powerful.
During his youth, Kin'emon's skills were acknowledged by Hyougoro, who stated that his subordinates could never be able to stand toe-to-toe with him. He was shown being able to fight on par with Ashura Doji during a sparring session.
Devil Fruit
[

Further information:
Fuku Fuku no Mi

Kin'emon ate the Fuku Fuku no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform small objects placed on a person's head, such as pebbles and leaves, into various articles of clothing. The clothes disappear once they have been removed or once they have taken a certain amount of damage.
He must first visualize the appearance of the clothes, otherwise his creations are limited.
While this power lacks direct combat applications, it does have a number of support functions; he can provide quick disguises for himself and his allies, letting them move around enemy territory undetected. He can also provide the necessary attire for survival in harsh weather conditions, such as creating a winter coat that can be worn in a frigid climate. Finally, he can create armor that can be used in combat.
Like many characters from Wano, Kin'emon considers his Devil Fruit ability a form of sorcery, but he is aware of his weakness to bodies of water.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Observation Haki
[
]
Kin'emon is a very skilled user of
Observation Haki
, as even after getting split by Law, his legs and his torso were able to fight, dodge attacks, and even defeat people without being attached to his head. When Kin'emon's disembodied legs first "spoke", they said it could feel the "aura" of other people around it, accurately attacking them.
Furthermore, his separated body parts navigated through Punk Hazard's geography by sensing their surroundings (although his legs still managed to somehow get stuck to a
dragon
).
Armament Haki
[
]

Kin'emon is an extremely skilled user of
Armament Haki
, known in Wano as "Ryuo".
His Armament Haki is strong enough to withstand the Torikago's razor sharp threads, which can slice cannon balls and meteorites with ease. When fueled by rage, his Haki-infused sword was able to pierce Kaidou's nigh-invulnerable body.
Weapons
[
]
Kin'emon wields two katana named
Sukesan and Kakusan
which he uses for his Foxfire Style and Oden Two Sword Style.
He also has a small dagger with him, although it appears that he only carries it around to commit
seppuku
if a situation calls for it.
