"Red Flag" X Drake
(pronounced as "Diez Drake") is the captain of the
Marine
Secret Special Unit
SWORD
. In order to go undercover as a
pirate
, he publicly defected from his position as
rear admiral
and founded the
Drake Pirates
.
He is one of twelve pirates referred to as the "
Worst Generation
",
and before the two-year timeskip had a bounty of
222,000,000.
Drake is the son of the Marine-turned-pirate
Diez Barrels
, and was affiliated with the
Barrels Pirates
until he defected to the Marines. As a young adult, he was called
Dory
.
In Drake's endeavor as an undercover spy,
he and his crew became subordinate to the
Beasts Pirates
, led by
Kaidou
of the
Four Emperors
, over the two-year timeskip.
Drake served as one of the crew's
Shinuchi
, specifically one of strongest six called
Tobiroppo
.
His treachery was eventually uncovered, however, leading him to ally himself with the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
.
Appearance
[
]
Drake is a tall, lean, and muscular man who wears what appears to be a combination of a white-plumed
cocked hat
with his crew's
Jolly Roger
on the side and a domino mask over his eyes. Underneath this headgear, Drake's hair is reddish brown, with brush-like sideburns. On his broad chin he has an "X" (not confirmed to be either a scar or tattoo) and on his chest and upper body he also has another large "X". The "X's", as well as that in his name, represents the Roman Numeral X for 10, not the English letter. When seen from above, his bicorne greatly resembles the head of a Pterodactyl.
He wears armor on his relatively thin legs and arms consisting of knee-high boots and gloves that go up past his elbows, respectively. The openings to both the gloves and the boots are also secured by the armor, which is rounded for the gloves and a sharp maple leaf pattern for the boots at the front of his knees. On the rest of his body, he wears leather pants and a leather shirt. A belt with a large ornately designed circular belt buckle secures Drake's pants as well as his sword and axe to his waist. He also wears a black cape, which, from the inside, is crimson-colored, with a white fur lining around the neck.
After the Summit War, he is seen wearing a scarf that is tied around his neck when he appeared on a winter island that was apparently under the protection of Kaidou.
In
SBS Volume 64
, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Drake is shown wearing a small tattered Marine uniform, showing that he aspired to become a Marine since he was very young. He had a rounder face, shorter hair, and a wooden sword at his side. He did not have the "X" on his chin yet. He appears to have been a playful and cheerful boy, as opposed to the stern and serious man he grew up to be.
As a young adult, Drake wore a tattered, bloodied shirt with pants and boots on the snowy Minion Island while with the Barrels Pirates,
though later on during a supposed escape, he managed to acquire a somewhat tattered, thick winter coat with a hood as well as a pair of dark gloves.
Due to the mental and physical abuse he suffered from his father, he was undersized for his age and easily mistaken as a child by the Donquixote Pirates.
After the timeskip, Drake no longer has his bicorne, exposing his now light orange hair spiked into a fauxhawk. In place of his bicorne, he now has a black headband with an eyehole cut out of it and his crew's Jolly Roger next to the hole. The headband is slanted so it goes over his left eye, and a thin piece of cloth from it, presumably cut from the hole, is fitted over his right eye.

Personality
[
]
In his childhood, Drake was a
Marine
enthusiast and deeply admired his father,
Diez Barrels
, who served the organization as an officer. When Barrels turned to piracy, Drake still thought of his father as a good man and kept following him.
As a young man thirteen years ago, Drake appeared to be the reluctant, submissive type, obeying his father despite the abusive treatment he was given. Barrels once stated that despite his strength, Drake was a coward and rarely contributed to his crew's operations. Indeed, by that point, Drake ran away when the opportunity presented itself, displaying no loyalty to his family.
In the present, Drake seemingly has not regretted this decision, holding no grudge towards the
perpetrators
of his father's death.
In spite of the horrible treatment his father gave him, Drake still remains loyal to the Marines, putting his life at risk in order to infiltrate the crew of one of the
Four Emperors
. Even when presented with the threat of torture, Drake stated that he would rather die than reveal his true allegiance, only deciding to keep fighting because he still had a mission to accomplish. Drake is flexible with his beliefs of Justice as he is not picky about potential allies in criminals and outlaws, going as far as request to join forces with
Monkey D. Luffy
, an enemy of the
World Government
, just because of the Straw Hat's friendship with
Koby
, Drake's subordinate.
An honorable man, Drake has declared that he intends to repay Luffy for accepting him as an ally in a time of need.
Currently, Drake displays a stern, dead-serious disposition at all times. Patient and observant, he appears to be a pirate who avoids needless violence, aware that such a thing would attract unwanted attention. In fact, he may even intervene in fights where he is not involved at all, doing so in the middle of confrontation between
Killer
and
Urouge
in an attempt to pacify both of his fellow
Super Rookies
.
However, when a situation calls for violence, Drake reveals a surprisingly ruthless and bloodthirsty streak.
Trafalgar Law
once implied that Drake had killed a significant amount of people in his career, reinforcing the notion that the former rear admiral is actually not opposed to conflict at all.
Later, Drake fearlessly attacked a
Pacifista
head-on, employing a brutal biting attack in his Zoan form. Drake is bold enough to even challenge a
subordinate
of the
Four Emperors
, knowing full well that such an action would put him in the crosshairs of the
Emperor
himself.
As one of the Tobiroppo, Drake is very much mission-oriented, always prioritizing the job assigned to him, although he might think his presence in certain tasks may be overkill, like assassinating the
owner
of a small noodle shop.
This professionalism and dutifulness also extend to his job as a Marine spy, reporting everything of note that he ends up witnessing in his cover.
Despite holding a high position in the
Beasts Pirates
, Drake self-admittedly has no interest in raising further in the ranks, unlike some of his fellow Tobiroppo.
In spite of his generally serious attitude, Drake is known to sometimes lose his composure in certain situations. In particular, naked women easily fluster him to the point of fainting at the sight of one, making him wary of entering places like bathhouses. Nevertheless, he still denies this weakness even if it's obviously the case.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Diez Barrels
[
]
Barrels
was Drake's father, and when he was a Marine Officer, Drake wanted to become just like him. However, when Barrels became a pirate, he was known to physically abuse his son. Drake remained with his father as he continued to see the past good of the man, but his loyalty started to waver. When Doflamingo attacked Barrels and his crew with the Birdcage, Drake fled and left them behind.
Thirteen years later, Drake was seen acknowledging Doflamingo as his father's killer, but stated that he held no grudge.
Barrels Pirates
[
]
13 years ago, he was a member of the Barrels Pirates. However, he was barely (if at all) loyal to the crew, considered "always a no show", and he simply ran for his own life instead of saving anyone when Doflamingo attacked.
Marines
[
]
It appeared that as a child, he hoped to be a Marine,
possibly because of his father's previous affiliation with them. Thirteen years ago, Drake fled the Barrels Pirates and was saved by the Marines.
At some point in the past, he joined the Marines and became a rear admiral,
but to public knowledge, he quit to become a pirate. He seemed to be aware of the
Pacifista
project, but had only recently learned of its completion while fighting one of them at
Sabaody Archipelago
.
In secret, he is still a member of the Marines, serving as the captain of the special forces unit
SWORD
.
His steadfast loyalty to the organization is that he would choose death over confession to the enemies, even if it means enduring torture, and he intends to return to the Marines in full eventually, which he did as he is recovering in the
Marine GS General Hospital
.
Koby
[
]
They appear to have a trusted professional relationship due to Koby being one of the few people who is aware that Drake's return to piracy was a ruse and he is still affiliated with the Marines as a commanding officer of the
SWORD
unit.
He also trusts Koby's views about Luffy as a benevolent pirate, as Drake requested to join Luffy's alliance after remembering Koby praising Luffy, believing that any remaining hope for his mission to defeat the Beasts Pirates lies in cooperation with the Straw Hat captain.
World Government
[
]
Drake teams up with Apoo to fight CP0
During his time with the Marines, Drake is loyal to the World Government. He did his best to follow the government's orders, but he has come to question them by noting the contradictions in their policies. His conversation with his fellow officer
Koby
demonstrates this by informing his colleague that
CP0
is conducting negotiations with pirates in
Wano Country
despite their own laws forbidding the practice. Drake states he is fearful of the government's collusion with criminals and he was shocked that he could not think properly.
At
Onigashima
, Drake entered in direct conflict with CP0 agents, who were aware of his position at
SWORD
. They attempted to assassinate him, leading Drake to even team up with Apoo (who he otherwise despises) to fight them off.
Sengoku
[
]
Sengoku did not just take care of Corazon like a father, but also did the same for Drake after he fled his father's crew.
Enemies
[
]
Beasts Pirates
[
]
Prior to the timeskip, Drake seemed to be interested in meeting Kaidou, having willingly provoked his subordinates in the New World in order to gain the
Emperor
's attention. Proving his loyalty, Drake squashed a rebellion led by
Caribou
(who was posing as
Gaburu
) on an island affiliated with the Emperor and destroyed
Amigasa Village
, defeating the five
samurai
who protected the community.
However, as Drake remained in secret a member of the Marines, he was reporting Kaidou's on-goings to his subordinates outside of Wano and secretly helping the rebels.
During the Fire Festival, Queen and Who's-Who wanted to kill him after learning that he was the one who helped free Law from prison. While his true allegiance was not exposed, his actions were enough to make him an enemy of the Beasts Pirates.
Scratchmen Apoo
[
]
Drake seemingly hates
Scratchmen Apoo
, a fellow member of the
Worst Generation
and looked forward to crushing him for personal reasons. Apoo similarly holds some disdain for Drake, based on his comments about the latter's alliance with Luffy.
When Apoo later wanted to pursue Drake into forming an alliance with him to take down the victor of the war, Drake openly displayed his distrust in Apoo's proposal. When they were both attacked by members of the CP0, they reluctantly formed a temporary teamup to take on the agents, but not before bickering at each other.
Basil Hawkins
[
]
Drake and Hawkins worked together at the
Flower Capital
during certain points of the
Wano Country Arc
. When Drake was sent to the capital alongside
Page One
to deal with
Sangoro
, Hawkins accompanied him due to having his own target to hunt as well. They also both participated in the rebellion crackdown and Yasuie's execution, both organized by Orochi. Because of his status as a mole, Drake was seemingly interested in the possibility of Hawkins defecting from the Beasts Pirates due to his forced recruitment by Kaidou, but the Magician shot down the idea.
Hawkins already suspected Drake for releasing Law from captivity at the Flower Capital and joined Who's-Who and Queen in questioning the undercover Marine, citing that there was no other likely candidate for the deed. From that point on, they became enemies.
After the
Raid on Onigashima
, both were heavily injured and Hawkins stumbled to Drake questioning him on being apart of the
Marines
, with Drake refusing to answer. Hawkins then revealed to Drake that the man who he divined as having a one percent chance of survival was him all along, and proceeded to collapse from his injuries.
Other
[
]
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
While working for the
Beasts Pirates
, Drake was an active enemy of the
Straw Hat Pirates
throughout the
Wano Country Arc
. However, with his cover blown during the
raid on Onigashima
, Drake was left with no choice but to join forces with Luffy and his friends in order to accomplish his duty. During the raid, he planned on repaying Luffy for his trust and accepting him into the alliance once the raid was over.
While Luffy had no qualms in letting Drake assist them,
Roronoa Zoro
,
Franky
and
Jinbe
all held their reservations towards the Marine, mostly because he kept his reasons for defecting unclear and were suspicious of his true affiliations.
Roronoa Zoro
[
]
Drake and Zoro team up against Apoo.
Among the Straw Hats, Zoro was the one who distrusted Drake the most when the latter sought their alliance, briefly clashing with him while questioning his true motives and allegiance. Zoro, however, accepted to team up with Drake once Apoo started summoning
Numbers
and
Queen
began shooting at them. Once Apoo was dealt with and Zoro headed off to the Skull Dome's rooftop, he praised Drake for helping hold the fort at the Live Floor and betting on the alliance's win.
Sanji
[
]
Because of Sanji's transgression against the
Kyoshiro Family
, Drake was one of two people sent to punish him.
After Page One failed to kill Sanji, Drake continued with his mission to hunt down Sanji and was relentless in attacking him at Rasetsu Town. Drake recognized Sanji as O-Soba Mask and brought up on how he heard that Sanji is from the
Vinsmoke Family
, much to the latter's irritation.
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
Donquixote Doflamingo
was the one responsible for the deaths of his father and his crew back on
Minion Island
. However, Drake never held a grudge against the
Ex-Warlord
for this due to having lost all respect for his father.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As captain of the
Marine Headquarters
' secret special force,
SWORD
and the
Drake Pirates
, Drake has great authority over his subordinates.
Even during his youth, he was the strongest member of the
Barrels Pirates
,
and he later achieved the rank of
Rear Admiral
in the
Marines
, prior to his public defection. He is a member of the
Worst Generation
that survived one of the seven harsh and dangerous routes through
Paradise
, the first half of the
Grand Line
, earning a bounty of
222,000,000 before entering the
New World
.
Despite his attack on a favorite island of the
Emperor
Kaidou
,
Drake survived the experience and made a greater name for himself.
At some point during the two-year timeskip, he became one of the
Tobiroppo
, the six strongest
Shinuchi
of the
Beasts Pirates
, holding a high position in the crew with authority over the lower-ranking members, before his treason was exposed and he left the crew.
Drake is an extremely formidable combatant; he stopped a fight between two other Supernovas with just one move,
effortlessly defeated a
Super Rookie
,
and was one of the few pirates on the
Sabaody Archipelago
capable of injuring a
Pacifista
without outside help.
According to
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
, Drake single-handedly defeated the five
samurai
who guarded
Amigasa Village
, and destroyed the town.
During the
raid on Onigashima
, Drake defeated the drunken
ancient giant
,
Juki
, with a single attack,
and despite having lost his battle against
CP0
, his sheer toughness was still praised by
Guernika
.
While a powerful person in his own right, he has a surprising weakness in that he becomes faint at the sight of a naked female.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Drake has immense strength; he blocked simultaneous blows from Urouge and Killer, fellow members of the Worst Generation, with little effort,
and knocked a Pacifista into a building with a mere two hits.
He has vast reserves of stamina and a great tolerance for pain, as he exhibited little discomfort after having a
laser
pierce through his abdomen,
remained conscious (though heavily wounded) after being kicked by
Kizaru
into a building at the speed of light,
and he quickly recovered after being defeated by CPO, retaining enough strength to impale an agent with his sword.
Drake also managed to survive being stabbed in the neck for some time.
Tactical Skills
[
]
Additionally, Drake is quite intelligent, interrupting
Killer
and
Urouge
's battle because he knew that it would only draw more unwanted attention,
and possesses a deep understanding of the workings of the
World Government
, being aware of the
Pacifista
and
Vegapunk
.
He successfully went undercover as a pirate captain and founded his own crew for an unknown purpose. After he left the Beasts Pirates, Drake quickly took advantage of his what he had previously heard about Luffy from Koby in order to convince him that he was on his side. He is also aware of the nature of Apoo’s Devil Fruit powers,’with the latter needing a line of sight on his target, allowing Drake to effectively avoid being hit by the Apoo’s attacks.
Swordsmanship and Axemanship
[
]

Drake dual wields both a rapier and a four-bladed axe and is extremely skilled in wielding them simultaneously.
Techniques
[
]
X Calibur
(
X
狩場
,
Ekusu Karibā
?
, literally meaning "X Hunting Ground")
: From above, Drake swings his sword to his right and his axe to his left, striking down upon an enemy with both weapons simultaneously. The attack was first seen used against an inebriated
Juki
, successfully knocking out the artificial ancient giant. Drake was in his allosaurus-hybrid form while performing the attack, likely enhancing its power.
The attack's name is a nod to the famous sword
Excalibur
from Arthurian legend, with the name's kanji representing a pun: 狩場 ("hunting ground") would normally be read as
kariba
, matching the Japanese pronunciation of "-calibur"
(
カリバー
,
karibā
?
)
, with the preceding "X" a play on Drake's name.

Drake ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Allosaurus, an
Ancient Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a full
allosaurus
and a human-allosaurus hybrid at will.
As a carnivorous Zoan, Drake gains a significant enhancement to his physical abilities in close combat. He also gains advantageous bodily characteristics, including extremely hard and sharp teeth and powerful jaws that are strong enough to bite through the stronger-than-steel body of a Pacifista, causing it to bleed. His great reptilian tail is also a powerful weapon, capable of slamming people with great force.
He also gains sharp claws on his feet, augmenting his kicks.

History
[

Past
[

Early life
[
]
Drake was born to
Diez Barrels
and an unknown woman. He aspired to be like his father and join the
Marines
. However, Barrels later became a pirate, and started physically abusing his son. However, Drake remained with his father as he continued to see the past good of the man.
Thirteen years ago, Drake was on
Minion Island
with the
Barrels Pirates
waiting for a trade deal of
5,000,000,000 in exchange for the
Ope Ope no Mi
. During that time, he was said to be a "brat" by Barrels. While on Minion Island, he narrowly missed being captured by
Donquixote Doflamingo
's
Birdcage
and ran away from it instead of helping the pirates from Barrels' crew escape.
He was later found and taken in by the Marines, who reported it.
Marine and Piracy
[
]
After the incident on Minion Island, Drake became a Marine and rose to the rank of Rear Admiral.
He then became part of the secret Marine organization
SWORD
, becoming its captain afterwards. Four years before the current storyline, Drake and other Marines accompanied
Kizaru
to
Egghead
to deal with an episode involving
Vegapunk
and a
certain pirate
.
At some point Drake went undercover as a
pirate
,
with his cover story being that he defected from the Marines to form a pirate crew, the
Drake Pirates
.
Drake was committed to his undercover role, and used his past experience to further his Piracy career, to the point that his cover story became well known and he became infamous enough to earn a bounty of
222,000,000. His crew traveled through the
Grand Line
and eventually would make it to
Sabaody Archipelago
.

[

Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
Drake stops Killer and Urouge's duel.
After a long voyage following one of the Log Pose routes of the
Grand Line
, Drake and his
crew
came to the
Sabaody Archipelago
to prepare themselves for the
New World
. While there, he noticed two other pirates,
Urouge
and
Killer
, fighting each other. Knowing full well what would happen if they caused too much of a scene, Drake stopped their battle and told them to hold it off until they reach the
New World
. The two fortunately complied with Drake's request. As Drake and his crew walked away from the two pirates, he was momentarily egged on by
Trafalgar Law
to fight. However, Drake was not swayed by the latter's behavior.
As Drake continued with the rest of his crew around Sabaody, he noticed that there were very few Marines on the mangrove. This puzzled Drake a bit since Sabaody was right next to the
Marine Headquarters
. However, it did not take long for Drake to figure things out as he received a newspaper with late-breaking news while traversing Grove 24. Written on it, as he told the rest of his crew, was news that
Portgas D. Ace
, the recently captured second division commander of
Whitebeard's crew
, was sentenced to public execution. Knowing that
Whitebeard
would definitely retaliate, Drake figured that the Marines would definitely need all the manpower they could get for the battle that would come, hence the shortage of Marines in the mangrove. All these disturbed Drake as he was wondering if the
World Government
and the Marines were asking for war.
Drake saving Urouge from a Pacifista.
When the news of
Monkey D. Luffy
's attack of a
World Noble
spread over the archipelago, Drake ordered his men to prepare the ship for departure immediately, but he also stated an interest as to which of the three admirals would be sent to deal with the situation.
After Admiral Kizaru arrived on the island, Drake was forced to attack him to save fellow Supernovas
Basil Hawkins
and
Urouge
in the midst of dealing with him and one of several
Pacifistas
invading the island.
After
Scratchmen Apoo
made his surprise attack, he was quickly dispatched by Kizaru, who then took down Drake and Hawkins with little effort.

Despite the confrontation with Kizaru, Drake and his crew managed to escape capture. He later watched the war at
Marineford
televised at Sabaody.
At the end of the war, the Drake Pirates approached Marineford and watched it to its conclusion from a safe distance on their ship while listening to Marine war intel through a
Black Den Den Mushi
. Drake commented that, with the conclusion of the war, the Marines would need to change.

Emperor
and is under his control. Drake questioned that if he were to attack Scotch, then he would get the attention of Kaidou, in which Scotch replied "yes". With this confirmed, Drake gladly activated his Devil Fruit and began his attack.
During the Timeskip
[
]
Sometime during the two-year timeskip, Drake joined

Drake and his crew attended the
Pirates Festival
on
Delta Island
. He participated in the main event, the Treasure Race, safely sailing up the
Knock Up Stream
and landing on the central Treasure Island, where all the pirates raced for
Gol D. Roger
's treasure, all the while battling other Worst Generation members. When
Buggy
ended up exposing himself after snatching the treasure, Drake and his crew chased after the Warlord. However, the Treasure Race was cut short, when someone threw a galleon at the island, destroying it, and sending everything plummeting back to the surface. When Drake realized that the one who did this was
Douglas Bullet
, he was quite surprised. In the end, he gave into Bullet's taunting, and together with the other Worst Generation members (except for Zoro and Law) attacked the Demon Heir. At first the Worst Generation pirates managed to deal a few good blows on the veteran, but when the opponent revealed his
Gasha Gasha no Mi
powers, the battle quickly ended in their defeat.
Later, after Bullet was defeated, his crew along with the other Worst Generation pirates and several other crews attempted to breakthrough the
Marines
encirclement surrounding the island. They were able to successfully escape thanks to
Sabo
and
Ann
creating a blazing barrier to protect them.

Wano Country Arc
[
]
At the
Flower Capital
, Drake and
Page One
were sent to punish a
soba shop owner
for beating up some of
Kyoshiro
's men. They were accompanied by Hawkins as well.
The next day, Drake and Hawkins led a group to raid a bathhouse and look for people with the
Kouzuki Family
's crescent moon symbol on their ankles. Drake came into the bathhouse after hearing about Sanji's presence. Upon seeing Sanji in his
Raid Suit
, Hawkins and Drake recognized him as
Stealth Black
.
After Sanji and his group escaped the bathhouse, Drake and Hawkins continued with their patrol in the capital.
Drake and Hawkins later stood guard at the prison in the Rasetsu District where
Shimotsuki Yasuie
was imprisoned and scheduled to be executed. As crowds of people gathered, Drake commented that all the attention and commotion from
Komurasaki
's funeral shifted to the execution.
When Shogun
Kurozumi Orochi
tried to kill
Toko
after executing Yasuie, Drake and Hawkins witnessed
Roronoa Zoro
and Sanji saving the girl.
With Sanji present, Drake transformed into his Zoan form and proceeded to attack him.
After Sanji handed Toko to
Usopp
, Drake slammed Sanji into the ground with his tail when the chef tried to strike back. Drake continued with his attack with Sanji evading and dashing off.
Drake informs Koby about the events in Wano.
After Hawkins captured Law, Drake secretly helped Law subdue Hawkins and let him escape.
Later, in an abandoned residence somewhere on the outskirts of Ebisu, Drake spoke with
Koby
via Den Den Mushi in secret and informed him of the recent events in Wano such as Kaidou and
Big Mom
's alliance and
CP0
's arrival.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Drake arrived at
Onigashima
with the rest of the Tobiroppo.
They then sat down to wait to meet with Kaidou and bickered amongst themselves.
When Kaidou arrived, he gave them the mission of finding his son
Yamato
, saying he would let them battle one of the All-Stars for their position if they succeeded.
Queen and Who's-Who ambush Drake.
As the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
waged war in Onigashima, Drake was speaking with Hawkins when
Who's-Who
approached them. Who's-Who asked Drake to join him in killing
Queen
. Though he had no interest in taking part of their feud, Drake followed Who's-Who anyway. He was then lured into an ambush, where Who's-Who and Queen attacked him. They accused Drake of treachery and questioned him, but an explosion enabled Drake to flee.
Drake joins Luffy in taking down a pair of Numbers.
After weighing his options, he attacked one of the
Numbers
. Having become an enemy of the Beasts Pirates, Drake requested Luffy to let him join the Alliance's side.
Zoro, Franky, and Jinbe did not trust him, and Zoro clashed with Drake. They finally joined forces when Apoo and Queen entered the fray. Drake was alarmed when Queen used
Excite Bullets
against the rebels
and unleashed the
Ice Oni
virus.
The virus spread, affecting both ally and foe alike. Queen tossed the only vial containing the antidote to Apoo and gave everyone the challenge to take the cure from him. As Apoo fled from his pursuers, Drake and Zoro attacked him together.
Drake continued clashing with Apoo until Zoro struck down the latter and grabbed the antidote vial.
After
Chopper
was given the antidote vial, Apoo recovered and tried to retrieve the vial, but Drake stopped him. He then told Zoro to go to the roof while he stayed to guard Chopper and the mass-production of the antidote.
Drake and
Hyougoro
continued fighting Apoo and the other Beasts Pirates, preventing them from reaching Chopper.
Drake was impressed by Hyougoro's strength after the yakuza singlehandedly defeated most of the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
and
Mimawarigumi
. Once Chopper had released the
Chopperphage
and cured the infected, he transformed into his
Monster Point
and slapped Queen, while exclaiming that he was not a "tanuki". Drake inwardly apologized for having called him such.
Drake later retreated into the Cave Chamber with Apoo and three Numbers. Apoo proposed another alliance to form with Drake to finish off the war's victor and come out victorious after the raid, to which Drake skeptically questioned Apoo's honesty and loyalty.
Drake rejected the proposal and, having figured out the workings of Apoo's
Devil Fruit ability
, engaged him in battle. Their skirmish, however, was interrupted by Yamato, who barged into the chamber and attacked Drake, unaware that he had renounced his Tobiroppo title. With Apoo showing interest in teaming up with Yamato, Drake followed after them.
Drake and Apoo face CP0.
Having pursued Yamato and Apoo into the second floor of the castle's basement, Drake witnessed the
Kazenbo
falling through the floor and burning several Beasts Pirates and the
CP0
agents
Guernika
and
Maha
who were chasing after
Nico Robin
and
Brook
. Guernika struck Apoo down for photographing them and revealed to Drake that they had figured out his identity as an undercover Marine. Just as they were about to silence him, Apoo, who had survived his prior assassination attempt, managed to counter the attack meant for Drake. The two
Worst Generation
pirates then started bickering, but ultimately decided to join forces against the government agents.
Drake stabs Guernika.
Despite holding them back for a while, Drake was defeated alongside
Zanki
after Apoo fled.
After
Izou
and
Maha
defeated each other, Drake overheard Guernika receive orders to kill Luffy. Refusing to let that happen, Drake stood back up
and stabbed Guernika from behind; however, the agent survived and stabbed Drake in the neck with Shigan.
After Kaidou had been defeated and Onigashima had landed, Drake was found by Hawkins and questioned if he was a Marine, but Drake refused to answer. As Hawkins slumped against a column, Hawkins admitted that although he had predicted his own high chance of death, he could not bring himself to betray Kaidou and return to Kid's side, making Drake remember their past conversation and rightfully concluding that Hawkins was referring to himself back then right before Hawkins collapsed to the floor.

Translation and Dub Issues

While written as is, the
X
in his name is meant to be read as
diez
(as "X" is the Roman numeral for "ten"), which means "ten" in Spanish, and can also be used as a surname.
