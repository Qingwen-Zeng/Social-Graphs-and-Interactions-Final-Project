Due to his increased size, Uzu is quite powerful. After suffering from withdrawal symptoms from Caesar's drugs, he ganged up with the other children, making them strong enough to beat up

History

Dressrosa Saga

Punk Hazard Arc
[
]
Uzu was taken from his parents by
Caesar Clown
and brought to live on
Punk Hazard
as a test subject. At one point, he was introduced to
Mocha
.
When the
Straw Hat Pirates
arrived at Punk Hazard and broke into the Biscuit Room, Uzu escaped with Nami, Franky, Sanji, and Chopper.
However, Caesar eventually recaptured them and returned them to the Biscuit Room.
When Mocha tried to escape with the candy drugs, Uzu chased after her alongside the other children.
Eventually, when Mocha swallowed all of the candy and suffered a severe overdose, the children started to question why would the candy cause such pain, leaving them vulnerable to Chopper administrating a sedative.
After Caesar's defeat,
Trafalgar Law
used his
Ope Ope no Mi
powers to remove all of the NHC10 and other harmful substances Caesar implanted in the children. The G-5 Marines used the SAD Tanker to send the children home, with the intent on having
Vegapunk
help them return to their normal sizes.
