Past

Garp
came to leave
Luffy
in their care.
He was later seen, along with Mogura, when the two of them were keeping an eye on
Ace
and Luffy while they were in the forest together.
After Gray Terminal was set on fire, he was seen with Dadan and the rest of the bandits when they came to rescue Luffy and Ace from Bluejam. He carried Luffy away when they ran from the fight.
On the day the World Noble was due to arrive, Dogra was at the dock where the welcoming ceremony would take place. He was surprised to see Sabo leaving the island with a ship. He then watched in horror as the ship was blown up by the World Noble, sinking as a result and taking Sabo with it.
He went back to the house to deliver the sad news to everyone. Upon hearing it, Ace immediately grabbed him, pinned him to the floor, and was about to punch him before the other bandits stepped in to restrain him. Dogra said he was completely serious about what he said and that even he could not believe it, even though he saw it with his own two eyes. He thought he might have been daydreaming or hallucinating when he saw the ship blow up.
The next day, after making sure Ace had calmed down since the night before, he is seen holding a letter from Sabo that he had just received from the
News Coo
. It was addressed to Luffy and Ace.
