.
Appearance
[
]
Marumieta has long light-colored hair tied in a curling ponytail. She wears a semi-formal dress and a tiara.
She had binoculars in both of her appearances.
Personality
[
]
Marumieta is a person who is "ignorant of the ways of the world", thus she is a curious one. She appears to be benevolent, as she went to
Water 7
in order to deliver supplies after the
Aqua Laguna
.
She used her binoculars to look at a catalog her father was holding despite standing right next to him.
It is unknown if it is because using binoculars is a habit or if she is extremely nearsighted.
