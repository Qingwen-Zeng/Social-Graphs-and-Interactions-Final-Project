Fukurokuju
is a
ninja
and the previous captain of the
Orochi Oniwabanshu
before they joined the
Beasts Pirates
following Orochi's deposition.
Though he pledged his team's support to Kaidou, Fukurokuju remained loyal to the surviving Orochi and helped him attempt to get revenge.
However, Fukurokuju was ultimately bested in combat by his rival
Raizo
as his and Orochi's plot failed.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist during the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Fukurokuju is a tall man with an elongated bald head. He has a very long and pointed dark beard, and his earlobes are extremely long. His left arm is tattooed, with a pair of thick zigzagging stripes as well as five ninja star-like shapes.  He wears a pair of square-shaped sunglasses and a purple kimono with a pattern of yellow rimmed, green circles with three white dots in them, as well the Japanese character 忍
(
nin
?
)
on his orange obi.
Twenty years ago, his head and earlobes were shorter and he did not have a beard. His kimono had a simpler design with the kanji 番
(
ban
?
)
on each side.
Personality
[
]
Despite the samurai code of loyalty stipulating that a warrior must remain loyal to their master as long as they (the warrior) live, Fukurokuju sees no point in serving a dead master and believes his duty as a ninja is to serve the current shogun, regardless of how that shogun came into power. This led him to serve Orochi without issue after the latter seized the shogunate from the
Kouzuki Family
,
and he questioned
Raizo
and the
Nine Red Scabbards
' devotion to
Kouzuki Oden
even after Oden's death, saying they are following a "ghost".
He was even willing to pledge himself and the rest of the Oniwabanshu to
Kaidou
, a pirate, after Kaidou had seemingly killed Orochi, though he would later return to Orochi's service after the two of them reunited and began fighting Kaidou's
Beasts Pirates
on Orochi's behalf; it is unclear what exactly transpired and what Fukurokuju knew between Orochi's seeming death and their reunion.
Fukurokuju has disdain for showing emotion and believes that being emotional will prevent one from ever being an effective shinobi, regardless of their skill in
ninjutsu
.
Despite disdaining emotional expression, Fukurokuju would express panic and fear whenever Orochi is angry or in dangerous situations as he started panic when his robes caught fire while under Raizo's Paralysis technique. While vigilant in enforcing Orochi's objectives and protecting the shogun, he was patient enough to give
Nico Robin
one chance to explain herself when she was caught snooping around Orochi Castle.
He has shown to be sadistic as he eagerly awaited Oden's death in his painful execution, and mocked Shinobu for putting her hopes on Oden.
Relationships
[
]
Fukumi
[
]
Fukumi
was Fukurokuju's little sister. Fukurokuju seems to have cared for her deeply, as he developed a grudge against
Raizo
because of her.
Kurozumi Orochi
[
]
Fukurokuju is staunchly loyal to
Kurozumi Orochi
, believing it to be his duty to follow the
shogun
no matter what.
Despite pretending to switch allegiances to the
Beasts Pirates
when
Kaidou
decapitated Orochi, he secretly continued to help and protect Orochi.
Raizo
[
]
Raizo
is Fukurokuju's hated rival. The two developed rivalry due to Raizo accidentally injuring Fukurokuju's little sister Fukumi, and Fukumi later calling out Raizo's name on her sickbed before dying, which Fukurokuju mistook for hatred (in truth, Fukumi had fallen in love with Raizo). Fukurokuju's head and earlobes slowly became elongated due to his bottled up rage against Raizo.
Fukurokuju considers Raizo unfit to be a
ninja
due to his emotional personality.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As former captain of the Orochi Oniwabanshu, Fukurokuju once had full control over the group of 5,000 ninja, formerly in service of Orochi, but currently Kaidou.

Fukurokuju fighting with his earlobes.
Fukurokuju has been noted to be an extremely skilled master of
ninjutsu
by
Shinobu
, a veteran kunoichi.
He is stated to be the biggest rival of
Raizo
, a ninja once affiliated with the Oniwabanshu who has been reputed as a genius since his youth.
Fukurokuju is quite adept at physical combat, unusually using his earlobes like whips as his signature method of fighting.
He also possesses enough mental clarity to see through Raizo's "clone" technique and strike the ninja's real body.
Techniques

Ninpo: Mimitabu Cracker
(
忍法 耳たぶクラッカー
,
Ninpō: Mimitabu Kurakkā
?
, literally meaning "Earlobe Cracker")
: Fukurokuju's signature method of fighting,
He controls his earlobes as though they were his arms and uses them to strike opponents with tremendous force like whips, with the earlobes having a considerable amount of range due to their length.
He can also achieve a form of flight by spinning the ends his earlobes rapidly like rotors.
In the VIZ translation, this is called
Ninpo: Earlobe Crackers
and
Earlobe Crackers
in the Funimation adaptations.

History
[
]
Past
[
]
Twenty years ago, Fukurokuju and
yakuza
leader
Hyougoro
were allied with the
Kouzuki Family
, but when the
Beasts Pirates
invaded
Wano Country
and
Kurozumi Orochi
took over the country, Fukurokuju betrayed the Kouzuki Family and pledged to serve Orochi. His subordinate at the time,
Shinobu
, was disgusted with this and left the Oniwabanshu.
Fukurokuju later accompanied Orochi to
Kuri
.
He was also present in the
Flower Capital
to witness
Kouzuki Oden
's execution.
After Shinobu revealed to the public what Oden did for the citizens during the past five years, Fukurokuju confronted her for her actions. However, she managed to flee as Oden met his end.
Wano Country Saga
[

Wano Country Arc
[

The
Orochi Oniwabanshu
caught
Nico Robin
snooping in a secret room in Orochi Castle, and Fukurokuju came into the room and gave her one chance to explain herself.
After Robin claimed to be
Ushimitsu Kozo
, Fukurokuju ordered his ninjas to capture her. However, the Robin they attacked was a duplicate created by
her Devil Fruit powers
. Fukurokuju then ordered his squad to find her.
As supporters of the Kouzuki Family were detained in the Rasetsu District Prison, Fukurokuju told the prisoners to remain silent after telling them that their plan failed.
He later went to the palace to report to Orochi about the capture of
Shimotsuki Yasuie
.
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
began causing chaos at Rasetsu Town following Yasuie's execution, the Orochi Oniwabanshu entered the battle. Fukurokuju recognized
Zoro
from a wanted poster and ordered his group to capture at least one of the Straw Hats.
Later, Fukurokuju informed Orochi of the Straw Hats' escape and the capture of
Trafalgar Law
. Fukurokuju also informed the shogun that the Flower Capital was on lockdown with the Orochi Oniwabanshu and the
Mimawarigumi
on guard. He reassured that he would not let anything harm Orochi until they captured their enemies.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Fukurokuju accompanied Orochi to
Onigashima
.
After Kanjuro informed Orochi that the plot to stop the Kouzuki rebellion failed, Fukurokuju reported that no rebel ships nor any suspicious samurai were seen, but
Luffy
, Zoro,
Kid
, and
Killer
were spotted on the island.
Fukurokuju later stood at the Performance Stage along with Orochi, Kaidou, and the All-Stars as Kaidou announced the
New Onigashima Project
.
Fukurokuju watched in complete horror and shock when Kaidou betrayed and decapitated Orochi while explaining his plans in detail.
When given the choice to join the Beasts Pirates or die, Fukurokuju quickly pledged his loyalty to Kaidou.
However, when the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
went on the attack and faced the Oniwabanshu, Fukurokuju slipped away unnoticed except by
Hotei
.
He proceeded to rejoin Orochi, who had somehow survived Kaidou's decapitation, and attacked members of the Beasts Pirates as the shogun began setting the castle on fire to take revenge.
Fukurokuju and Orochi later ran into the Scabbards, and the shogun tried to take down the samurai himself by transforming into the
Yamata no Orochi
. However, Fukurokuju witnessed the Scabbards decapitate all of Orochi's heads with a quick combined attack, and would later confront his rival
Raizo
while the other Scabbards continued moving on.
Raizo wins against Fukurokuju.
Raizo questioned why Fukurokuju would serve a man as wretched as Orochi, but Fukurokuju responded that it was his duty to serve the shogun and that Raizo and his comrades were serving nothing more than a ghost. Raizo used
Bunshin no Jutsu
to create multiple images of himself at once, but Fukurokuju was able to spot his real body and attack it with his earlobes. Fukurokuju then criticized Raizo's emotions for getting in the way of his effectiveness as a ninja, but Raizo objected to this viewpoint.
Both ended up in each other's paralysis jutsu, restricting them from moving any further, demanding each one lifts theirs first. When Raizou's nio-dasuki caught fire, Fukurukujou mocked his survivability due to the flames, to which Raizo only insisted on him being immune to fire due to his background as Oden's vassal.
When the flames reached Fukurokuju as well, he plead for Raizo to release the paralysis, but Raizo remained resolute
and succeeded in outlasting Fukurokuju.
