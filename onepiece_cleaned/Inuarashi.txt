Duke Inuarashi
is a canine
mink
. He was one of the two
rulers
of the
Mokomo Dukedom
,
dubbed the "
Ruler of Day
",
holding the position from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM.
He currently serves as the
daimyo
of
Kuri
.
Inuarashi and
Nekomamushi
served as retainers for the
Kouzuki Family
of
Wano Country
,
as members of
Kouzuki Oden
's
Nine Red Scabbards
.
The pair also followed Oden as he travelled with the
Whitebeard Pirates
and
Roger Pirates
.
Pedro
has claimed Inuarashi and Nekomamushi must not be allowed to die because "the world is waiting for them".
He is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Whole Cake Island Saga
and the
Wano Country Saga
.
Appearance
[
]
Inuarashi is an incredibly large and grizzled canine mink.
He wears a small pair of blue sunglasses and has shoulder-length black ears, a white beard,
and a large and bushy tail.
Like all the retainers of the
Kouzuki Family
, Inuarashi bears the family crest somewhere on his body.
During the battle against
Jack
, he wore a dark-colored striped suit with a frilled collar, a belt, a light-colored cape, and a helmet.
After waking from his coma, he wore a king-like robe, and his head and torso were covered in bandages.
While being tortured by Jack, Inuarashi lost his left leg.
Later, during the
Raid on Onigashima
, it is revealed that he has replaced it with a sword.
After becoming the daimyo of Kuri, he replaced the sword with a pegleg.
Personality
[
]
Inuarashi is a kind, noble, and humble mink who is deeply loved and respected by his people due to his great benevolence. He was eager to meet the
Straw Hat Pirates
after they saved the Mink Tribe, indicating a grateful personality,
and he downplayed his strength when he was complimented by Luffy.
Inuarashi has a very refined and sophisticated personality as he is very polite and soft-spoken in speech. He refers to himself with "watashi" and always speaks to people including enemies in a very courteous manner. Due to his gentleman sophistication, Inuarashi strongly dislikes barbarism, as he was greatly shocked by Jack's completely unreasonable and violent nature. He also holds strong contempt for Nekomamushi, who he insultingly called a Monster Cat due to the latter's aggressive and wild personality.
Despite being the strongest warrior on Zou,
Inuarashi prefers diplomacy over aggression when dealing with hostile parties. He cares immensely for his people and their rich cultural history, to the extent that he was willing to lay down his sword to reason with
Jack
and the
Beasts Pirates
and would have allowed them to search for
Raizo
if they ceased their attack.
During the brutal interrogation by the Beast Pirates for Raizo's whereabouts, Inuarashi pleaded with Jack and his men to spare his citizens from their brutality despite being subjected to horrendous torture himself. However, he is also firmly loyal and possesses an incredibly strong will, having absolutely refused to reveal Raizo's presence on Zou despite the brutal torture at the hands of Jack even when he lost his leg, and was fully willing to risk the kingdom's destruction in order to protect his friend.
Like the rest of the canine minks, Inuarashi finds Brook to be delicious because of his body of bones, but was willing to let him recover and chew on him later after seeing his injuries.
Relationships
[
]
Allies
[
]
Nekomamushi
[
]
Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reconcile.
Inuarashi and Nekomamushi were once friends, but their friendship became strained after Oden's execution
as the two minks blamed each other for Oden's death.
Because of this, they avoid meeting face-to-face.
Upon accidentally meeting, they exchanged hostile words and insults before preparing to enter a battle to the death despite their respective injuries.
Despite their present-day enmity, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi agreed to form a truce in order to avoid agitating Momonosuke
and while reminiscing about their past adventures, they became very jolly and friendly with each other again.
Kouzuki Family
[
]
Due to Oden protecting him, Nekomamushi and
Kawamatsu
from discrimination in
Wano Country
during their youth,
Inuarashi is extremely loyal to the heir of the
Kouzuki Family
, whom he serves as a retainer alongside
Nekomamushi
.
His loyalty to Oden and his family is so great that he risked sacrificing his kingdom and its inhabitants just to protect
Raizo
, another retainer of the clan,
and later agreed to form a truce with his bitter rival Nekomamushi in order to appease
Kouzuki Momonosuke
.
Nine Red Scabbards
[
]
Inuarashi, alongside the other Red Scabbards (with Izou taking Kanjuro's place), charges into battle.
Aside from Nekomamushi and Kanjuro, Inuarashi has an extremely strong and close friendship with fellow members of the Nine Red Scabbards, even after twenty years of separation. Inuarashi risked his life and kingdom to protect Raizo from Jack, absolutely refusing to reveal Raizo's whereabouts even when brutally tortured to the point of losing his left leg. He was also happy to see Kin'emon and Kanjuro again, while wasting no time in allying with them to defeat Kaidou. While Inuarashi was willing to frame Ashura Doji of crimes in order to get him back into the fold, he later expressed sincere regret for having to do so.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Inuarashi is very grateful to the Straw Hats for saving the citizens of Zou after they were devastated by Jack's invasion. He believes that Luffy will become the next Pirate King since he, along with Nekomamushi, willingly showed him and his crew Zou's Road Poneglyph. Also, he finds Brook to be delicious since he's made of bones.
Enemies
[
]
Jack
[
]
Inuarashi was willing to reason with Jack when the latter and his men attacked the Mokomo Dukedom, even giving him and his underlings the opportunity to search for Raizo unimpeded as long as they did so peacefully. However, Jack refused his offer, forcing Inuarashi to enter combat with him.
When Jack used
Caesar Clown
's
gas weapon
to incapacitate the minks, he crucified Inuarashi and tortured him, which led to the Duke losing his left leg
when he refused to reveal Raizo's location.
At Wano, Inuarashi still bears hatred for Jack for what he did at Zou.
He and
Nekomamushi
later fought against
Jack
again at
Onigashima
, this time using their
Sulong
forms, and ultimately defeated him.
Inuarashi would re-encounter Jack again down in the Treasure Repository and decided to settle the score with him solo.
Later taking their fight to the courtyard and while Inuarashi was able to briefly gain the advantage by transforming into his Sulong form again,
only to be badly hurt upon losing his Sulong form where Jack admitted he would have been beaten by one more direct hit, Inuarashi was able to regain his Sulong form and finish off Jack once and for all with
Oden One Sword Style: Inu Spire
.
Kurozumi Kanjuro
[
]
Inuarashi was previously on good terms with
Kanjuro
, as both served as faithful vassals of Oden. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi rejoiced tearfully when Kin'emon and Kanjuro showed up at Zou, and reunited in the hopes of overthrowing Orochi. However, Kanjuro later revealed that he was of the
Kurozumi Family
, that he was a spy sent by Orochi all along, and that he was the one who revealed the
alliance's
plans to Orochi, greatly shocking Inuarashi alongside the other Scabbards present. By providing Jack a
Vivre Card
to Zou, Kanjuro was also responsible for the attack on the Mink Tribe, something he flaunted in front of a furious Inuarashi.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of the former two rulers of the Mokomo Dukedom, Inuarashi held a large amount of influence over the
Mink Tribe
, and acted as the main authority figure during daytime.
Inuarashi had full authority over the members of the
Inuarashi Musketeer Squad
, including the combat force delegated to
Shishilian
,
Concelot
, and
Giovanni
, who all took their orders directly from him,
before he stepped down from his position.
Inuarashi is just as strong as his nightime counterpart and friend
Nekomamushi
, causing all of their battles to end in stalemates. According to
Wanda
, he is his country's strongest warrior.
Inuarashi fought evenly against
Jack
, an All-Star of the
Beasts Pirates
with a bounty of
1,000,000,000, before the latter poisoned him with
Caesar Clown
's
Koro
gas.
By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, Inuarashi (in his Sulong form) was able to seriously injure the
Emperor
Kaidou
in his
dragon form
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Main article:
Electro
Inuarashi clashes with Jack.
Alongside Nekomamushi, Inuarashi is one of the two strongest minks of the Mokomo Dukedom. He possesses immense physical strength and durability, having stopped Jack's
enormous trunk
, which destroyed a building in a single swing moments before, with one hand.
He has great levels of endurance as he fought against Jack and his replenishing forces for five days, taking 12-hour intervals to recover, and still managed to survive exposure to the Koro gas and an entire day of torture, which included the loss of his left leg.
Even after being brutally defeated by Kaidou, Inuarashi still retained enough strength to lift Jack, in his Human-Beast Form, over his shoulder and toss him through a wall.
Like all minks, he can use
Electro
.
It is unknown how much the loss of his leg affects his overall combat abilities, but he managed to clash evenly with a one-armed
Nekomamushi
; their clash created a shockwave powerful enough to blow the surrounding minks away.
Similarly, he fought the mighty
Ashura Doji
to a draw.
Sulong Form
[
]
Main article:
Sulong
Inuarashi transformed.
As a member of the
Mink Tribe
, Inuarashi can awaken the Sulong transformation when looking at the full moon. In this form, Inuarashi's strength, speed, agility, Electro, and fighting abilities are magnified. Along with Nekomamushi, he could take out multiple members of the
Beast Pirates
and completely overwhelm Jack and would have killed him if Kaidou had not intervened. Using this form is risky as it can cause severe exhaustion if used for too long. However, he can revert to his normal form by blocking his eyes from the moonlight.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Further information:
Oden Two Sword Style
Inuarashi's two-sword style.
As the commander of the Musketeers, Inuarashi is an extremely skilled
swordsman
. He can enhance his swordsmanship by infusing his rapier with Electro, which he used to hold his own against Jack in his
full mammoth form
and, in the anime, performed strong defensive blocks to defend against Jack's attacks with his sword. Inuarashi's sword skills are advanced enough to clash with Nekomamushi's spear skills.
After adding a sword to replace his missing leg, he quickly adapted to a two-sword style.
While in Sulong form, Inuarashi was able to inflict considerable injury to Kaidou in his dragon form.
Inuarashi, alongside three other Scabbards, wields Oden Two Sword Style against Kaidou.
Inuarashi is capable of emulating Oden's signature
Oden Two Sword Style
style, allowing him to wield two swords and perform one of his techniques.
He is even capable of using a more personal version known as Oden One Sword Style.
Weapons
[
]
Inuarashi wields a rapier, which he can channel Electro through.
While dueling
Ashura Doji
, he wielded a katana.
He later attached a sword to his missing leg, allowing him to wield two blades together.
Against Kaidou, he used both his rapier and katana together to perform Oden's signature technique.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Armament Haki
[
]
Inuarashi possesses the ability to use
Armament Haki
.
He can harden his swords and also has an advanced level of this Haki, as shown when he cut through Kaidou's tremendously tough skin.
Observation Haki

Inuarashi possesses the ability to use
Observation Haki

History
[
]
Past
[
]
In the distant past, Inuarashi and
Nekomamushi
were friends.
When they were children, they were told of the pact the
Mink Tribe
made with the
Kouzuki Family
. Curious, they left
Zou
and journeyed to
Wano Country
, but got shipwrecked. They were discovered at Kuri Beach by
Kawamatsu
.
Afterwards, the three were caught and persecuted by some humans until
Kouzuki Oden
came and rescued them. They then followed Oden back to Kuri and became his retainers.
Young Inuarashi and his fellow retainers are caught stealing by Yasuie.
When they were running low on funds, the retainers attempted to steal money from
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, but they were caught. Instead of punishing them, Yasuie allowed them to take the money and encouraged them to use it to become better people for the sake of Oden and Wano.
Following Yasuie's advice, they educated themselves and trained to become dignified warriors. 30 years ago, they visited the
Flower Capital
with Oden.
After meeting the
Whitebeard Pirates
, Oden and his retainers had a feast with them. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi also learned from
Marco
on how vast the world is. Two weeks later, the two minks stowed away on
Whitebeard's ship
before they left Wano, knowing that Oden would not stop wanting to get on their ship. They revealed themselves after
Whitebeard
accepted Oden into the crew three days later. Afterwards, they traveled the seas together with the crew.
Two years later after the birth of
Kouzuki Momonosuke
and Oden got a
bounty
, Nekomamushi noticed that the
newspaper
hardly had any news about Wano Country. Inuarashi pointed out that is the same with Zou, due to having no contact with the outside world.
Around 26 years ago sometime after the birth of
Kouzuki Hiyori
, the Whitebeard Pirates clashed with the
Roger Pirates
on an island for three days and three nights before the skirmish turned into a gift exchange and Oden decided to join
Gol D. Roger
to assist him with his final journey. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi boarded the
Oro Jackson
as stowaways.
The two minks and Oden then sailed with Roger, and they visited
Skypiea
at one point. When the crew sailed to
Water 7
, the minks revealed to Roger about the Road
Poneglyph
at Zou. The Roger Pirates' voyage later took them to
Tequila Wolf
,
Sabaody Archipelago
, and
Fish-Man Island
. Sometime after the visit to Fish-Man Island,
Toki
became ill and the crew stopped by at Wano. The two minks chose to stay at Wano with Toki and her children so they never went with Oden to
Laugh Tale
. Before parting ways with Roger, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi gave him a letter of introduction for the Mink Tribe.
Inuarashi and Nekomamushi told
Kikunojo
about Izou's stay with the Whitebeard Pirates. Around six months before Oden finished his voyage, the retainers were furious at
Kurozumi Orochi
for abusing his position as shogun. Inuarashi and Kawamatsu stayed behind at Oden Castle while the others marched to the Flower Capital to confront Orochi. A group of
Beasts Pirates
attacked Oden Castle, but Inuarashi and Kawamatsu repelled them. When Oden returned to Wano after finishing his journey, the retainers (except
Denjiro
and
Ashura Doji
, who were elsewhere at the time) welcomed him back and told him about Wano's situation. Oden then ordered his retainers to protect his family and Kuri before charging to the capital by himself.
After Oden failed to kill Orochi, the retainers remained loyal to him for the next five years despite Oden acting like a fool and losing the respect of most of Wano's people. 20 years ago, Oden finally had enough and decided to take down
Kaidou
. The retainers eagerly followed him and marched with him to
Onigashima
.
On the way to Onigashima, the group was confronted by Kaidou and his crew in the Udon region. In the ensuing battle, the samurai were joined by
Shinobu
. Unfortunately, the samurai were overwhelmed in the end. Oden and the Scabbards were then imprisoned in the Flower Capital and sentenced to be boiled alive in three days.
All ten prisoners were later brought to the execution site, at which point Oden made a deal with Kaidou. After Oden stepped into the pot of boiling oil, the retainers were about to join him, but Oden grabbed a plank and ordered them to stand on it as he held them over the pot.
As Oden endured
the hour
, he explained to his retainers the reason Wano Country was isolated and requested them to open Wano's borders for him. Oden successfully survived the hour, but Orochi summoned a firing squad to execute Oden and his retainers. Oden once again told his retainers to open Wano's borders before throwing them far away from the pot. The Scabbards fled with tears as Oden met his demise.
After Oden's death, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi began quarreling with each other on the way back to Oden Castle. The two minks were captured by
Jaki
and they were left behind by the other retainers.
They eventually managed to escape and return to Zou barely alive, but they continued their feud to the point that they began fighting whenever they were together,
so they decided that Inuarashi would rule Zou during the day and Nekomamushi would rule during the night.
During the Timeskip
[
]
Inuarashi stops Jack's attack.
When
Jack
and the Beasts Pirates invaded the
Mokomo Dukedom
in search of
Raizo
the ninja, Inuarashi arrived to confront Jack while the
Musketeer Squad
battled Jack's subordinates. Inuarashi tried to reason with Jack and stated that they would be allowed to search for Raizo if he ceased the destruction, but Jack responded by attacking Inuarashi with his trunk. After easily blocking the blow, Inuarashi clashed with Jack until 6 pm, where he and his forces retreated so that Nekomamushi and his warriors could continue the fight in their stead.
Inuarashi is defeated by Jack and crucified.
The battle against the Beast Pirates lasted for five days, with Nekomamushi and Inuarashi taking turns fighting against Jack. On the fifth day of the battle, Jack lost his patience and used
Caesar Clown
's
Koro
gas to poison the minks. With the Mink Tribe rendered helpless, Jack tortured the strongest of them, including Inuarashi and Nekomamushi. During the torture, Inuarashi lost his left leg. The torture ceased when Jack heard about
Donquixote Doflamingo
's defeat and capture, causing Jack to leave Zou in order to rescue him while leaving behind some of his subordinates.
After
Sanji
's group arrived, they forced the Beasts Pirates to retreat and Caesar to neutralize the poison gas before tending to the wounded, which saved the Mink Tribe.
However, Inuarashi fell into a deep coma.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Zou Arc
[
]
On the day
Monkey D. Luffy
's group arrived on
Zou
, Inuarashi awoke from his coma and wished to meet the
Straw Hat Pirates
, prompting
Chopper
,
Miyagi
, and
Tristan
to rush to his quarters in order to check up on him.
Inuarashi meets the Straw Hats, his saviors.
After the other Straw Hats arrived with
Wanda
, Inuarashi thanked all of them for saving his country. When Luffy commented on how powerful he looked, Inuarashi dismissed this as being something that could not be said about the defeated, which prompted Wanda to remind him that the minks had the upper hand against the
Beasts Pirates
until
Jack
brought in his gas weapon.
Salivating at the sight of
Brook
and his body of bones, which he decided to chew on later, Inuarashi noticed Luffy's
straw hat
and revealed that he had once traveled the seas with
Nekomamushi
and encountered
Shanks
. However, before Luffy could explain how Shanks had been the one to give him his hat, Inuarashi suddenly fell asleep due to dusk arriving.
A few minutes later, Inuarashi briefly woke up to explain how Luffy's group indirectly forced Jack to leave Zou before falling asleep once more.
Inuarashi and the minks reveal that Raizo is safe.
The next morning, Inuarashi was alerted by
Bariete
ringing the town bells. After arriving at Kurau City, Inuarashi accidentally made eye contact with Nekomamushi, causing the two of them to confront each other. After trading insults and commenting on each other's lost limbs, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi began a fight to the death, but stopped when
Kin'emon
revealed himself and declared his status as a retainer of the
Kouzuki Family
. When Kin'emon asked them if
Raizo
had come here, a tearful Inuarashi knelt alongside the rest of the minks and revealed that Raizo was safe before smiling as Kin'emon expressed his relief.
The minks take their allies to Raizo and a red poneglyph.
While conversing with Kin'emon, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi began arguing again, prompting
Kouzuki Momonosuke
to reprimand them for doing so because it would make
his father
sad to see them behaving like this. Not wanting to disappoint their lord, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi apologized and called a truce, to the delight of their fellow minks. Shortly afterward, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi escorted the samurais and the Straw Hats to a secret area in the Whale Forest where Raizo was hidden. When
Nico Robin
saw the red
Poneglyph
that Raizo had been chained to, Inuarashi noted that it was made for a different purpose than the regular Poneglyphs were and gave Robin permission to read it.
After Robin deciphered the red Poneglyph, Inuarashi revealed that it was one of four Road Poneglyphs that would reveal the location of
Laugh Tale
when their information was combined. Soon afterward, he began weeping when the samurais revealed Oden's execution at the hands of
Kaidou
and the shogun of
Wano Country
.
Having revealed that Oden was part of
Gol D. Roger
's crew, the samurais and the two rulers of Zou revealed his will to open the Wano Country to the world. After he and Nekomamushi declared that the Mink Tribe would help the Kouzuki Family fight Kaidou and the shogun of Wano Country, Inuarashi claimed that the minks would show their true strength the next time they faced the Beasts Pirates before shedding tears at the sight of Momonosuke vowing to avenge the deaths of his parents and protect his retainers. After Luffy agreed to help Momonosuke defeat Kaidou, Inuarashi officially formed the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
with Momonosuke, Luffy, and Law. Upon learning of
Sanji
's arranged marriage with
Big Mom
's daughter
Charlotte Pudding
, Inuarashi asked Luffy if he would be alright while going up against an
Emperor
before expressing confusion at Luffy's mention of
Pekomamushi
.
As group left the secret room, Inuarashi revealed that he and Nekomamushi once traveled with Oden aboard the ships of both
Whitebeard
and Roger, though they never went to Laugh Tale. As he reminisced about his days of adventure, Inuarashi happily danced with Nekomamushi while he did the same. Hearing
Nami
's concern about their journey to the end of the
Grand Line
in regards to what they had just learned about Laugh Tale's location, Inuarashi revealed that the last island on the Grand Line, while not actually Laugh Tale, still held significance and explained that the Straw Hats had merely learned the information regarding the poneglyphs and Laugh Tale that was on that island far in advance. After praising Nami's skills as a navigator, Inuarashi continued descending the Whale Tree while noting that
Marco
, whom they intended to have join their alliance, might not readily aid them. Suddenly, Zou began shaking violently, causing a shocked Inuarashi to note that he had never felt anything like this.
Zou begins shaking due to Jack's attack.
As everyone scrambled to find something to hold onto, Inuarashi was shocked to learn that Luffy could also hear
Zunesha
's voice. Upon learning from Momonosuke that Jack had returned and was attacking Zunesha from the sea, Inuarashi mobilized the minks to send out their ships and engage Jack, but was shocked to learn that Zunesha sank Jack's fleet with its trunk at Momonosuke's command. Afterward, Inuarashi admitted he had never even considered that Zunesha possessed its own will or could respond to commands.
When Momonosuke chose to remain on Zou in order to communicate further with Zunesha, Inuarashi decided to stay with him in order to guard Zou from the threat of Kaidou and promised to bring Momonosuke back to Wano at a later date. Upon hearing Kin'emon wondering if the separate teams would maintain contact with one another via
Den Den Mushi
, Inuarashi admitted that the inhabitants of Zou did not use the communication snails. Soon afterward, as the Sanji Retrieval Team departed from Zou, Inuarashi, along with the rest of those present save the Straw Hats left behind, was shocked when Luffy jumped off Zunesha with his party.
As Inuarashi stood watch at Zou's entrance, Wanda asked him to rest and said that they could post some guards, but Inuarashi was deeply concerned about how the Beasts Pirates located Zou and suspected that they might return.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Inuarashi and his group later arrived at Wano Country. At
Kuri Beach
, Inuarashi reminisced about his first meeting with Oden.
He and his group later found a severely injured
Tama
at a wasteland. As they took the girl to the forest for medical treatment, Inuarashi scorned Kaidou for his actions.
Inuarashi clashes with Shutenmaru as the latter refuses to help the Kouzuki Family again.
At Mt. Atama, Inuarashi clashed with
Ashura Doji
, but the fight was interrupted by Kin'emon.
Sometime later, the Musketeers worked to steal food and weapons from the Beasts Pirates and they left a note saying that Ashura and his gang were responsible for the thefts.
At an abandoned village in Kuri, Inuarashi was surprised to hear that the Beasts Pirates found out about Kin'emon's secret message.
After Mt. Atama was set on fire, Kin'emon and Inuarashi heard that Ashura was going to Bakura Town to confront the Beasts Pirates there and the two went after him.
They later entered Bakura Town and caught up with Ashura on the way. They also witnessed
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution on the broadcast and mourned his death.
After the execution, Ashura asked Inuarashi and Kin'emon if they knew about the
SMILE
fruits.
Outside Bakura Town, Ashura learned that he was framed for theft and got angry. Inuarashi and Kin'emon apologized and once again asked Ashura to join them. Ashura then told them to follow him, wanting to show them something.
Later, Ashura showed them the graves of their dead comrades and explained what had happened to their allies ten years ago. He recounted how they had all lost patience and had tried to fight Kaidou, but were all killed in battle. Afterwards, Ashura decided to rejoin his comrades. Inuarashi and Ashura then rejoiced and bragged to Kin'emon about how they had twenty years more fighting experience than him now. In response, Kin'emon called them a duo of geezers and the three began arguing.
Ashura later took Kin'emon and Inuarashi to an abandoned port and showed them ships that could carry their troops to
Onigashima
.
Inuarashi and Kin'emon also received the blueprints of Kaidou's residence from Ashura. While Kin'emon was speaking to Raizo via
Smart Tanishi
, Inuarashi was surprised to hear about the number of allies Raizo's group had gained at Udon.
He later joined a meeting with several key alliance members at Amigasa Village.
The group then learned from
Roronoa Zoro
and
Kawamatsu
that
Kouzuki Hiyori
is alive. On the day for the raid on Onigashima, Inuarashi marched to the rebel meeting place with Momonosuke, Kin'emon,
Kanjuro
, Raizo,
Shinobu
,
Kikunojo
, Kawamatsu, and Ashura.
The group eventually arrived at the meeting place, but found none of their ships and allies.
In spite of this major setback, the Scabbards were still determined to go through with the raid, knowing that they would not get another chance.
The Scabbards set sail and left Momonosuke at the port. As Kin'emon wondered about the possibility of a traitor among them, Kanjuro then revealed that he was the mole, leaving the other Scabbards stunned at this revelation. After Kanjuro explained what he did, Kin'emon angrily beheaded him, only to learn that it was a copy and the real Kanjuro remained on the coast and that he had captured Momonosuke to bring him to Onigashima. As this was happening, the Scabbards' boat was confronted by three Beasts Pirates ships, but the ships were suddenly attacked by the Straw Hats,
Heart Pirates
, and
Kid Pirates
. The Scabbards' boat was then lifted by
Law's submarine
.
When
Kyoshiro
arrived, the Scabbards were confused to see him attacking one of the Beasts Pirates ships. They were then shocked when Kyoshiro revealed himself to be Denjiro and that he freed the prisoners in the Flower Capital and the rebels gathered at
Habu Port
. To their relief, the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance's allies arrived at Tokage Port on a massive fleet to commence the raid on Onigashima.
Kanjuro then fled the scene with Momonosuke in tow on a drawn crane and briefly attacked the alliance with an ink cloud that rained down ink arrows. Momonosuke ordered the alliance to press forward to Onigashima without worrying about him. As the alliance was attacked by a Beasts Pirates ship with long ranged cannons,
Jinbe
came to aid the rebels.
After
Shishilian
and
Hyougoro
boarded the Polar Tang, the Scabbards discussed with
Trafalgar Law
about the plan to enter Onigashima.
After the Straw Hats defeated the guards at the torii gates, the Heart Pirates and the Scabbards (except Kin'emon and Denjiro) traversed to the back of Onigashima inside the Polar Tang.
Along the way, they were contacted by Nekomamushi, who just arrived and was planning to meet them at Onigashima.
When the submarine got close enough, Law teleported himself and the Scabbards with him to Onigashima's back entrance, where they were joined up by
Marco
, Nekomamushi, and
Izou
.
After Marco left to check on a shadow he saw at sea, the group was confronted by Kanjuro and an army of Beasts Pirates. While Kikunojo clashed against Kanjuro, the rest fought the other enemies.
Kanjuro and the Beasts Pirates with him were defeated, and Inuarashi's group were soon rejoined by Kin'emon and Denjiro. They then entered
Kaidou's castle
, fought their way to the Performance Stage, and launched an all-out attack on Kaidou.
While falling to the lower floor, the Scabbards managed to inflict wounds on Kaidou. As the alliance revealed themselves and attacked the Beasts Pirates, Kaidou transformed into
his dragon form
and flew to the roof of the Skull Dome, with the Scabbards grabbing onto him. On the roof, the Scabbards prepared to fight Kaidou with the Mink Tribe's help.
When Jack arrived to the roof with a platoon, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi's subjects urged their two leaders to focus on Kaidou.
As Jack fought back against the minks, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi transformed into their
Sulong
forms and charged at Jack.
The two were able to badly wound Jack, to the point where Kaidou had to step in and call him off to rest. With Jack and his forces out of the way, the Scabbards and Izou resumed their confrontation with Kaidou.
Inuarashi and three other Scabbards slash Kaidou's scar.
Kaidou roared lightning at them, but they dodged around it and each struck him in turn. After Raizo reflected Kaidou's Bolo Breath back at him, four of the Scabbards—Inuarashi, Denjiro, Ashura, and Kin'emon—replicated an
Oden Two Sword Style
stance and struck Kaidou's scar with the same attack that made it.
Kaidou then retaliated with a roar that created wind scythes aimed at the Scabbards.
Continuing the battle in human form, Kaidou began overwhelming the Scabbards
and later incapacitated them. Big Mom,
Eustass Kid
,
Killer
, Zoro, Luffy, and Law later arrived at the roof. Upon Luffy's request, Law teleported the Scabbards to a safe place.
They were placed in the treasure room on the second floor, where a mysterious person was tending to them.
The Scabbards later recovered and regained consciousness, but the mysterious figure already had left. Before they left the treasure room, they saw who appeared to be Oden.
Many of the Scabbards believed it was him; however, "Oden" was quickly exposed to be a drawing made by Kanjuro, who was still alive and heading for Momonosuke. The Oden drawing then lit a large quantity of
dynamite
under its garment, but Ashura Doji tackled it out of the room before it exploded, sacrificing himself to save his comrades.
The Scabbards immediately headed out to find Kanjuro, but were then confronted by Beasts Pirates All-Star
Jack
; Inuarashi stayed behind to battle him. Jack noted that Inuarashi would be unable to use his Sulong form while within the castle, to which Inuarashi replied Jack wouldn't have access to his chemical weaponry either.
While the two fought, Jack's underlings kept Inuarashi exhausted while he tried to fight the All-Star, until the Gifters began turning on the other members of the crew thanks to
Tama
, confusing Jack.
Inuarashi defeats Jack.
Inuarashi threw
Jack
out of the treasure repository and into the courtyard, where the former was able to reactivate his
Sulong
transformation due to the explosion caused by
Ashura Doji
having blown open a hole in the
Skull Dome
's roof.
Though Inuarashi was eventually placed at a huge disadvantage and was badly injured due to the storm clouds caused by Kaidou and Momonosuke's dragon forms blocking off the full moon causing him to revert back, once the clouds parted due to Luffy and Kaidou's clash of advanced-grade
Supreme King Haki
, Inuarashi was able to regain his Sulong form and swiftly defeated Jack with
Oden One Sword Style: Inu Spire
which pierces Jack's stomach and rendered him unconscious, with Orochi secretly watching Jack's defeat from afar.
After Nekomamushi announced that Luffy had defeated Kaidou and that Momonosuke had safely landed the island, a volcano erupted where Onigashima once sat, so Momonosuke flew with his sister and retainers into the Flower Capital in order to calm the panicking citizens. As the citizens marveled at the return of the Nine Red Scabbards, Denjiro then announced Momonosuke as the new Shogun of Wano Country. After broadcasting a speech to the whole country, Momonosuke, along with his retainers, entered the shogun's castle.
The samurai ready to protect Luffy from Ryokugyu.
A week later, Inuarashi was enjoying the ongoing festivities when Luffy, who had finally woken up, raised a toast for the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance and Wano citizens.
When the Kouzuki Retainers noticed
Admiral
Ryokugyu
's approach, several of them, including Inuarashi, went out to stop him from entering the Flower Capital. Using
his Devil Fruit powers
, Ryokugyu attacked the samurai and announced his intent to go after Luffy. They were joined by Yamato and Momonosuke, and the retainers became distressed as Ryokugyu restrained Momonosuke.
However, the battle was then ended by
Shanks
' burst of Supreme King Haki outside of Wano. Inuarashi later returned to the Flower Capital alongside the rest of the group.
The samurai with Shogun Momonosuke planning a bright future for Wano.
Inside the Shogun Castle, he was present when Kin'emon explained why he wasn't with them during the fight and after Kin'emon finished his story, Inuarashi would summon Carrot to him and Nekomamushi. As Carrot stood before them, he explained that they would name Carrot as the next leader of the Zou Kingdom, much to the latter shock and surprise, as they explained their motives to stay behind in Wano to protect Momonosuke. When Carrot was doubting her strength and leadership qualities, they explained to her they were confident she could do this task as she was the one who carried Pedro's will in her heart and was therefore most qualified.
He later joined his fellow Scabbards alongside Yamato and Momonosuke when the latter took his place as the new Shogun of Wano.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Inuarashi and Nekomamushi getting captured by Orochi's forces after Oden's death was first shown in
Episode 910
. However, the manga later revealed that the two minks were captured by a Number. Furthermore, when Inuarashi first recounts his meeting with Oden in the anime, Oden was shown peacefully intervening on Inuarashi and Nekomamushi's behalf rather than beating up the torturers.

Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
"Inu Arashi" means "Dog Storm". The second part could also be short for "porcupine"
(
ヤマアラシ
,
yamaarashi
?
)
, which would match
Nekomamushi
's naming scheme of two animals. The Viz translation originally used the latter translation, referring to him as "Dogupine". However, they later switched to the former translation and now refer to him as "Dogstorm". The anime has always used the latter translation.
