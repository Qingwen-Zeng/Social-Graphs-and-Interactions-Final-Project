mink
and the
navigator
of the
Heart Pirates
.
He is the younger brother of the late

[
]
Bepo is a polar bear mink. He wears an orange jumpsuit that bears the Heart Pirates'
jolly roger
. He also wears small brown boots and has sharp teeth and claws. He is as tall as a normal bear, considerably taller than common
humans
.
In
Wano Country
, he had a topknot despite having short fur and no hair. He also wore a yukata with the Heart Pirates' jolly roger surrounded by fish.

Personality
[
]
Bepo tends to get depressed easily and apologizes whenever people point out that he is a talking bear. An example of his sensitivity is when
Hancock
called him a beast and scolded him for attempting to change the subject. His crewmates also scolded him when he wondered aloud whether
Amazon Lily
had female bears, much to their annoyance. Overall, members of the Heart Pirates accuse Bepo of having a weak will. Ironically, he was able to remain conscious after taking a blast of
Supreme King Haki
from
Rayleigh
, a feat only the exceptionally strong-willed can accomplish. Those who do not know him call him meek.
He has been shown to order
Jean Bart
around (albeit unsuccessfully), seemingly delighted to have seniority over him. At the same time, he does not want Jean Bart to order him around. In the anime, he is shown to dislike hot environments (possibly due to his thick fur and the jumpsuit he wears), as he complained when the
Heart Pirates' submarine
was near an underwater volcanic region. Much like other male characters when they see a robot, Bepo is able to express admiration towards the
General Franky
.
Sometimes, he can do foolish things like eating a fish from a toxic river.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the
navigator
of the
Heart Pirates
, it can be assumed that Bepo has the knowledge required to navigate the
seas
. The level of his skills is as yet unknown, though it is expected that he is reasonably capable of navigating through the
Grand Line
. Interestingly enough, despite his occupation, he is not seen wearing a
Log Pose
, which is essential for Grand Line navigation. He also has some skill in cartography, as he was the one who drew the
map
of
Dressrosa
and
Green Bit
that Law shared with the
Straw Hats
. However, he appears to be a bit messy, as the map had his paw print on it, and
Nami
stated that his map-drawing and navigation skills are far from her own.
Bepo is fairly strong-willed, being able to withstand a blast of
Silvers Rayleigh
's
Haki
.
He also has extremely good hearing, being able to detect
a sniper
and his exact positioning quickly by picking up the moment of fire with his ears.
Befitting the animal he is based after, Bepo is an excellent swimmer and can attain great speeds while at sea.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Bepo attacking a group of Marines.
As a member of the
Mink Tribe
, Bepo, like all other minks, is a born warrior. Though he has not yet shown it yet, it can be presumed he is able to use
Electro
.
He is also a skilled
martial artist
combining his fighting skills with his superior physical abilities as a mink, allowing him to take out several
Marines
with ease but he is not strong enough to break a
Pacifista
as when he attempted to kick one, he wounded his leg, similar to
Sanji
's attack on
Bartholomew Kuma
.
After the timeskip, Bepo's fighting skills and physical prowess significantly improved. In the anime, he could hold his own against the
Gifters
of the
Beast Pirates
for twelve consecutive hours before
Nekomamushi
forced him to retreat.
Sulong Form
[
]
Main article:
Sulong
Bepo transformed.
As a member of the Mink Tribe, Bepo is able to awaken the
Sulong
transformation when looking at the full moon.
In this form, Bepo's strength, size, speed and fighting abilities are magnified, earning him acknowledgement from his crewmates as being the second strongest after Law,
and letting him briefly fight back against even the
Emperor
Blackbeard
and several of his
Titanic Captains
.
Bepo also has access to a special drug developed by
Chopper
that allows him to transform without the need of looking at the full moon, allowing him to tap into the Sulong's power at any moment.
History
[

Past
[
]
Law protecting Bepo from being bullied by Shachi and Penguin.
Bepo was born on
Zou
.
At age 8, Bepo wanted to chase after his older brother,
Zepo
, and climbed down
Zunesha
's leg to get a better view of the
sea
, but he got swept away. He later boarded a
ship
heading for the
North Blue
. A year later, on
Swallow Island
, Bepo was bullied by two boys named
Shachi
and
Penguin
, but another boy named
Trafalgar Law
came and knocked out Shachi and Penguin with
his Devil Fruit powers
.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Bepo followed Law back to
Wolf
's house, and Law became acquainted with him. He decided to let Bepo stay with him and Wolf, who agreed to it. A month later, Bepo and Law saw an explosion in the forest, and they found Shachi and Penguin, who had been severely injured in a boar attack. Law and Bepo brought them to Wolf's house, where Law gave orders to treat them. After Shachi and Penguin recovered, they thanked Law's group and revealed that they had no place to go after being orphaned and abused. Law offered for them to become his subordinates, to which they agreed, and Wolf agreed to let them stay in his house.
Concludes non-canon section.
Bepo, Shachi, and Penguin joined Law to form the
Heart Pirates
. Bepo studied navigation since he wanted to find the way back to Zou, and became the crew's
navigator
.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
On
Sabaody Archipelago
, Bepo stood behind Law as they watched
X Drake
stop the fight between
Killer
and
Urouge
.
Bepo later sat beside Law in the
Human Auctioning House
.
After the
Straw Hat Pirates
attacked the
World Nobles
and their
guards
, the audience fled except for the Heart and
Kid Pirates
, who withstood
Silvers Rayleigh
's burst of
Supreme King Haki
.
The three
pirate captains
went outside to fight the
Marines
, and afterwards, Bepo defended Law from some other Marines. The
Heart Pirates
then escaped after freeing
Jean Bart
, a
slave
of Saint
Rosward
's.
However, their path was blocked by a
Pacifista
so they joined the Kid Pirates in fighting it.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Still on Sabaody, the Heart Pirates watched the broadcast of
Summit War of Marineford
. When the broadcast was cut off, Law told his crew that they were setting sail.
The Heart Pirates arrive at Marineford.
Toward the end of the battle, the Heart Pirates'
Polar Tang
surfaced outside
Marineford
.
After
Kizaru
threatened him,
Buggy
dropped the injured
Jinbe
and
Monkey D. Luffy
down to Law. Bepo carried Luffy, noting that the Straw Hat
captain
was severely wounded, and wondered if the boy was still alive.
Once inside the ship, Bepo called for Law to close the door so that they could submerge. Law caught Luffy's
straw hat
from Buggy, and the Heart Pirates then began treating Luffy and Jinbe. The ship managed to escape
Aokiji
's
Ice Age
and Kizaru's
Yasakani no Magatama
and was pursued by
Boa Hancock
.
Out in the open
sea
, the crew encountered the
Warlord
. When Hancock asked the crew about Luffy's condition, Bepo complimented Hancock for being able to track the submarine. Hancock then scolded Bepo for changing the subject and referred to him as "beast", which caused the bear to apologize and sink into a depression. Hancock then demanded a
Den Den Mushi
and Bepo quickly complied.
Post-War Arc
[
]
The Heart Pirates soon reached
Amazon Lily
and arrived at the port. While Bepo's crew mates were anxious to see into the isle of women, Bepo asked if there were female bears too and his crew mates snapped back reminding him Amazon Lily is a country of
human
women, causing Bepo to be depressed again.
After the arrival of Rayleigh, the Heart Pirates left Amazon Lily. Bepo's crew mates were depressed that they did not get a chance to peek into the women kingdom. Bepo stated that it would be better if they were bears, only to be told to shut up.
Once again near Sabaody Archipelago, Law used the sleeping Bepo as a back rest while he discussed with his crew about his decision not to enter the
New World
yet.
Post-Timeskip
[
]
Before arriving at
Dressrosa
, Law revealed that Bepo and the other Heart Pirates went to
Zou
.
After their arrival,
Nekomamushi
took them under his care.
During the
Beasts Pirates
' invasion, the Heart Pirates assisted the
Mink Tribe
and fought alongside the
Guardians
.
They fought until
Jack
used one of
Caesar Clown
's
poison gas weapons
. After Jack left,
Sanji
's group arrived and tended to the injured.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Zou Arc
[
]
Right after the arrival of Luffy's group and Law, Bepo tried to stop a fight between Luffy and
Roddy
. Bepo explained that Luffy is an acquaintance, but Roddy ignored him, saying that Luffy was an intruder. After
Wanda
and
Carrot
arrived and stopped the fight, Bepo and the rest of the Heart Pirates got reacquainted with Luffy. At first, Bepo and the crew were confused about who "Tra-guy" was until Luffy clarified that it was Law. Bepo and the rest of the crew were excited to hear that Law was on Zou. They then climbed up into the trees to escape the eruption rain.
As Wanda took Luffy to see his friends, Bepo explained that he could not leave the Whale Forest and asked Luffy to inform Law of his whereabouts.
The Heart Pirates reunite with Law.
When Law went off to meet his crew, the Heart Pirates were overjoyed to be reunited with him.
After the Straw Hats returned to the Whale Forest, the Heart Pirates greeted Luffy, but were then furious when Luffy and Law went on having a private conversation while ignoring them. The Heart Pirates and Luffy's crew (except
Franky
,
Robin
, and
Brook
) then partied with Nekomamushi and his subjects.
Zou was later thrown into chaos when Jack returned and began attacking
Zunesha
. However, Zunesha retaliated and sank Jack's fleet.
As the Sanji Retrieval Team departed from Zou, everyone, except for the Straw Hat members left behind, was shocked when Luffy jumped off Zunesha with his party.

Wano Country Arc
[
]
After leaving Zou, the Heart Pirates infiltrated
Wano Country
. On top of a mountain, Bepo,
Shachi
, and
Penguin
spotted Luffy and
Roronoa Zoro
through binoculars as the two entered
Okobore Town
.
The trio later informed Law about Luffy and Zoro heading to Bakura Town in pursuit of
Gazelleman
who had abducted
Tama
.
On the way to Bakura Town, Bepo ate a fish from the polluted river and got sick, delaying Law from reaching the town.
Suffering from diarrhea, Bepo hid in the bushes near the ruins of Oden Castle.
While
Kin'emon
told Luffy's group about Wano's past, the Heart Pirates waited outside
and witnessed
Kaidou
's arrival over Okobore Town.
After Luffy rushed off with Law following him and Kin'emon and
Kiku
left to rescue
Tsuru
, the rest tried to escape as Kaidou approached the castle and destroyed it with a
blast of heat
.
Bepo and the other males in the group were saved by the kunoichi
Shinobu
's
jutsu
which sunk them into the ground.
Bepo and the others are released from captivity in exchange for Law.
Sometime after this ordeal, Bepo worked to deliver Kin'emon's secret message to his allies.
Bepo, Penguin, and Shachi were later captured by the Beasts Pirates and incarcerated in the
Rasetsu District Prison
to be used as bait for Law.
Prior to Law's arrival, Bepo was
linked
to
Basil Hawkins
before being moved to another location.
The trap, however, did not work as intended, and Law remained resolute in cutting Hawkins down regardless of his or his crewmates' lives, prompting Hawkins to reconsider the situation. As a result, Bepo, Shachi, and Penguin were released by Hawkins, who made a deal with Law for their freedom in exchange for his capture. Law ordered his subordinates not to tell Luffy about this in order to not compromise their plan for the eventual raid. Bepo later met up with
Nami
at Ebisu Town and gave her Kin'emon's secret message now drawn with two lines on the snake as
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's last message. After Nami left, the Heart Pirates discussed their captain's situation.
The Heart Pirates and the Scabbards arrive at Onigashima.
Once Law managed to escape from the
Flower Capital
, Bepo and the rest of the crew reunited with their captain at some point and entered the battle with the Beasts Pirates on the day of the
Fire Festival
. After rescuing Kin'emon's group from Orochi's trap, the crew was shocked to hear that Kaidou had formed an
alliance
with
Big Mom
.
Following the takedown of the guards at the torii gates by the Straw Hat Pirates , the Heart Pirates and the
Scabbards
(except Kin'emon and
Denjiro
) traversed to the back of
Onigashima
in the Polar Tang,
avoiding the myriad whirlpools along the way.
When the submarine got close enough, it rose to the surface and Law
teleported
himself, Bepo, Shachi, Penguin, and the Scabbards to Onigashima's back entrance.

Inside
Kaidou's castle
, Bepo joined in the all-out attack on the Beasts Pirates alongside his captain.
Later on, Bepo heard Sanji's cry for help as it was broadcasted throughout Onigashima.
Bepo and his two crewmates eventually met up with Franky at the Right-Brain Tower, joining forces with him to prevent enemy reinforcements from getting into the
Skull Dome
's Live Floor.
After fires spread throughout the castle, Bepo collapsed from the heat and had to be carried by Shachi and a samurai as they fled from the fires.
Raizo
and Jinbe managed to send torrents of water through the castle, extinguishing the fires. Bepo and his crewmates were swept up in the water.
After Nekomamushi announced the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
's victory over Kaidou and Big Mom, Bepo was reunited with Law and hugged his captain.
Bepo, still clinging to Law, watched the broadcast of
Kouzuki Momonosuke
's speech to the citizens of Wano.
A week after the raid, Bepo and the Heart Pirates, alongside the Kid Pirates and some of the Straw Hats, oversaw the repairs to the their ships. Bepo marveled at the
General Franky
, which was also being repaired. Law and Kid warned their respective crews about the dangers the others and the outside world would pose once news leaked about the raid. When Bepo wondered if their
bounties
would skyrocket as well,
Scratchmen Apoo
laughed and tossed down a recent newspaper that listed the new bounties.
Bepo marveled at Law's
3 billion bounty. Later that night, the Heart Pirates enjoyed the continued festival in the Flower Capital, celebrating the Alliance's victory.
A few days later, at
Tokage Port
, the Heart Pirates prepared their ship to set out from Wano.
After goading from Kid, Law and Luffy also directed their ships down the large waterfall, instead of taking the safer lift at
Mogura Port
.

Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
On their way to the next island, the Heart Pirates were ambushed by the
Blackbeard Pirates
, who were in search of
Road Poneglyphs
. The attack damaged their submarine and infected the crew with the
Feminization Disease
; Bepo became infected and turned into a woman. After Law's Haki canceled out the transformation on his own body, the resulting antibodies spread through the crew, curing the infected. The submarine then surfaced at a nearby island, and the crew ran ashore and prepared to fight back against the Blackbeard Pirates. Law saved his crew from a mountain thrown by
Jesus Burgess
and then confronted
Blackbeard
directly.
When
Van Augur
tried to snipe Law, Bepo alerted Jean Bart and ordered him to protect the captain, successfully blocking the shot.
The battle ended in the Heart Pirates' defeat, with the Polar Tang also being destroyed. When Blackbeard was observing his options on what to do with Law's powers, Bepo consumed a drug that Chopper had given him. It activated his Sulong Form, and he used the power to knock back the Blackbeard Pirates and then to throw a boulder at them. He then grabbed Law and escaped by sea. Law did not want to leave the rest of the crew behind, but Bepo insisted on trusting the crew's resilience to survive.
Later, Bepo came ashore at an unknown location and was seen listening to
Vegapunk
's broadcast as Vegapunk addressed individuals containing the initial
"D."
in their names.
