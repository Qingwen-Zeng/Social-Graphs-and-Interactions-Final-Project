Personality
[
]
Not much is known about his personality, but as Sentomaru stated, he was dumb enough to buy the Fake Straw Hats' deception.
In the anime, he is shown to admire the Marines' courage when facing him. It is also shown he was a daring and reckless individual, as he was looking forward to facing off against a Pacifista, only to end up defeated.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
It can be assumed that he is very strong as he was able to make it to
Sabaody Archipelago
.
Fake Luffy
remarked that if the
Pacifistas
were able to defeat Doughty in mere seconds, there was no way to fight them, suggesting combat prowess.
Weapons
[

Doughty with his sabre.
Doughty carries several weapons on his person: during his first introduction, he was seen carrying a sabre, he has a pistol hanging from his sash. He was later seen using a sword with a serrated blade resembling a saw (somewhat like
Arlong
's
Kiribachi
, but with more teeth yet smaller in overall size), but it was broken when he was attacked by a Pacifista.
