His arms are relatively long and thin in comparison to his build. He wears a white brimmed hat on his head and a green and turquoise striped shirt with an elaborate collar.

When he was still a member of the Whitebeard Pirates, he wore a polka-dotted shirt and a vertically-striped shirt on various occasions.
Personality
[
]
Epoida is a bold pirate who does not lose his bravery when faced with a difficult situation, as seen when he smiled defiantly and charged forward even though he was going up against
Marine Headquarters
. Furthermore, Epoida highly values loyalty and friendship, since he was willing to answer the call of
Whitebeard
to put his own life on the line to save
Ace
. Additionally, he possesses high respect and care for Whitebeard risking her life for him instead of escaping through path that the emperor created, as he could not hold back his tears when the
Emperor
was killed by
Blackbeard
.
He too seemed to fear Monkey D Dragon's reputation.
Relationships

Whitebeard Pirates
[

Even after he formed his own crew, he chose to remain loyal to Whitebeard and chose to fight alongside them during the
Summit War of Marineford
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Epoida is a fearsome pirate who has managed to make himself an infamous reputation in the

Epoida ate a currently unnamed
Zoan
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to transform into a
caterpillar
. In this form, he can retain his human head and hands, but grows caterpillar-like sections on his chest, with the colored stripes on his shirt seemingly merging with them, and also larger, more rotund forearms.
Weapons
[
]
Epoida wields a double sided
jousting lance
, similar to the one
Speed Jiru
possesses. It can be assumed that he is proficient at using it since it was his main weapon during the battle against the
Marines
. He wields it by holding both of his hands on its handle and pointing it onwards with his arms above him as he charges.
Epoida can also use two swords to an extent as he armed himself with a pair of swords when he prepared to descend off of Whitebeard's paddle ship.
In the anime he is replaced by another ordinary pirate.

Early Years
[
]
Thirty years ago, Epoida was still an immediate member of the
Whitebeard Pirates
when they arrived for the first time at
Wano Country
. The crew was shipwrecked and, before going into the island to gather supplies, they encountered
Kouzuki Oden
, who, after a brief clash, asked
Whitebeard
to let him join their crew.
The Whitebeard Pirates later had a feast with Oden and his retainers where Epoida was seated next to Oden as he continuously asked to join the crew. Two weeks later, the Whitebeard Pirates tried to leave Wano without Oden but, as they were leaving, Oden wrapped a chain around the
Moby Dick
's mast and was dragged off shore with
Izou
clinging onto him, the sight of which caused Epoida and the rest of the crew to exclaim out in surprise. After they only pulled up Izou, Epoida gathered around him as Whitebeard challenged Oden to hold on for three days before he could join the crew. For the next three days, the crew watched how Oden withstood his ordeal and cheered for him when there was just an hour left. After Oden was accepted, Epoida and the crew went on many journeys with him and, on one occasion, they partied and danced alongside each other in celebration.
Two years later, Epoida was present at the meeting when Whitebeard decided that it was time for him to split the crew into five divisions. Upon hearing this, he and
Vista
raised their hands in agreement at what they thought was a wonderful idea.
Epoida and the crew charge into battle.
Another two years later, the Whitebeard Pirates arrived at an island and noticed a commotion that frightened even the animals. Upon Whitebeard engaging in battle with
Gol D. Roger
, Epoida and the crew then took up arms and fought against the
Roger Pirates
as well. The skirmish was fought for three days and three nights, but ultimately ended in a gift exchange, where Epoida found a nice looking shirt and asked where they had gotten it from. Afterwards, when Oden decided to join Roger for a year, Epoida and the crew happily bid Oden and his family farewell and stated that they hoped to hear about his journey when he returned.
Rise to Infamy
[
]
Epoida later became the captain of his own crew and chose to remain subordinate to Whitebeard and the Whitebeard Pirates. He then established himself as an infamous pirate captain in the
New World
.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Marineford Arc
[
]
When
Portgas D. Ace
was to be executed at
Marineford
, Epoida and his crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
in order to save him from execution. While the
Marines
were bracing for the arrival of the pirates, Epoida and the allied fleet of the 43 subordinate captains caught them by surprise when they suddenly appeared out of nowhere just off the shores of Marineford.
Whitebeard
then arrived and sent a tsunami crashing down on Marineford, but the ocean is then
frozen
over by
Aokiji
. Taking advantage of the frozen sea, Epoida and the other allied captains then charged across the frozen terrain to reach the bay.
Later, Epoida continued to fight alongside
Karma
and
Amadob
. When
Sengoku
revealed that, not only was
Monkey D. Luffy
the adoptive brother of
Portgas D. Ace
, but was also the son of the Revolutionary,
Monkey D. Dragon
, Epoida exclaimed in shock about what he had just heard.
Soon after, Whitebeard gave commands to the allied forces and Epoida agreed to attack the right side of the bay.
Epoida and the other allied captains charge into battle with Luffy.
After the siege wall was raised and
Akainu
melted the ice with his
magma powers
, Epoida boarded Whitebeard's hidden ship and entered the plaza with the help of
Oars Jr
. Epoida then jumped off the paddle ship and prepared to continue the fight to save Ace.
During the charge, Whitebeard gave the order for all the pirates to backup Luffy. Hearing this, Epoida and the other captains created a barrier of protection around him and ran alongside him as the latter ran towards the execution platform.
After Ace was freed, Epoida watched as
Squard
crashed into the paddle ship into the bay and announced that he would take over the battle.
Later, Epoida cried alongside his comrades when Whitebeard was killed by the
Blackbeard Pirates
.
Soon after, the
Red Hair Pirates
arrived onto the battlefield and a grieving Epoida watched on as
Shanks
demanded for the war to end. Sengoku then declared that the battle was over and allowed the pirates to leave.
