History

]
Reverse Mountain Arc
[
]
The Unluckies first appeared near the end of the
Straw Hat Pirates
' stay with
Crocus
, where they overheard
Mr. 9
and
Miss Wednesday
discussing their failure to catch
Laboon
. Upon hearing this and thinking that the duo were late because they were plotting to betray
Baroque Works
, the Unluckies dropped an exploding package on them.
Whisky Peak Arc
[
]
After
Roronoa Zoro
's battle against the 100 bounty hunters in
Whisky Peak
, the Unluckies arrived and prepared to punish the remaining bounty hunters, who were attempting to run away. However, they stopped when
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
came to eliminate a spy within their organization.
When the spy,
Vivi
, accidentally revealed
Mr. 0
's true identity to three of the Straw Hat Pirates, Mr. 13 drew pictures of the three to report to their boss before the two departed.
Little Garden Arc
[
]
The Unluckies defeated by Sanji.
Later at
Little Garden
, the Unluckies were sent to check up on
Mr. 3
and
Miss Goldenweek
. Instead, they encountered
Sanji
, who was pretending to be Mr. 3 while answering a phone call from Mr. 0. They attempted to assassinate Sanji, but he kicked Mr. 13 into the side of Mr. 3's wax house hard enough to leave an imprint and twisted Miss Friday's neck until it snapped.
Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
[
]
The Unluckies accept a bribe from the Marines.
The Unluckies survived their encounter with Sanji and were used by the
Marines
to make drawings of the Baroque Works agents that were not captured in
Arabasta
(using a hot bowl of
donburi
as encouragement).
It is unknown what was done with them afterward.
