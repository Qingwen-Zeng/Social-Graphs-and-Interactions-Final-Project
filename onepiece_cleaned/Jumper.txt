Jumper
is a
Gifter
in the
Beasts Pirates
.
Appearance
[
]
Jumper is a man of average size. His most distinguishing trait is his helmet in the shape of an American football, with a white and red-striped design, and an arrow pointing down toward his face. Like other Gifters, he has a pair of horns sticking out of it as well. He wears a yellow shirt with letters "SB" on it, purple gloves, and a purple scarf. He appears to have a tattoo on his left arm, with a spotted and striped blue-yellow design.
In the anime, Jumper is initially depicted as a dark-skinned man with no tattoos and no gloves. He wears a blue shirt with no designs and a yellow scarf. His helmet is completely white, but his headphones are blue and he has a protrusion on his forehead, which is quite different from the manga.
Later, his design would be changed to something much closer to the original, changing his shirt to white with letters "SD" on it, and his pants to green. While his helmet does not entirely match the manga, it does include the arrow, which is depicted as red. His scarf is also changed to a red coloring.
