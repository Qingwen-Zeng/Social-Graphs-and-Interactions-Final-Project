History

Romance Dawn Arc
[
]
Luffy emerges from the barrel.
Peppoko, along with his crewmates
Heppoko
,
Poppoko
and
Koby
, found
Luffy
in the barrel he had drifted to their hideout in as they were about to have a drink from the barrel thinking it had wine in it. The first three intimidated Koby due to his low status as a ship caretaker, and tried to attack Luffy, but were interrupted by Alvida's attack. After that, they reported to Alvida about Luffy when she scolded them, thinking they were slacking off. They later accompanied her to the site where Luffy and Koby were. They were shocked when Luffy insulted Alvida. They were even more shocked to witness Luffy surviving Alvida's blow and defeating her. Luffy then orders them to give him and Koby a boat to which they complied.
