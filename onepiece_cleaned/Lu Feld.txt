Drug Peclo
was invited to
Big Mom
's
Tea Party
, intending the remark as an insult, which caused
Stussy
to call him small-minded.
Lu Feld is also greedy and unscrupulous, as he attempted to steal the treasure within the
Tamatebako
when given the opportunity despite it belonging to Big Mom.
He found the Big Mom Pirates' treachery against the
Vinsmoke Family
amusing rather than disturbing, laughing as Judge cried as this meant the impending end of the Germa.

Lu Feld partakes in the tea party festivities.
Lu Feld and his family were invited by
Big Mom
to a
Tea Party
in which
Charlotte Pudding
would marry
Sanji
. Lu Feld wondered why
Drug Peclo
was also invited, and
Stussy
told him to stop being small-minded.
Charlotte Perospero
welcomed the emperors to the
Whole Cake Chateau
and created a
candy escalator
in order to get them to the ceremony faster; Lu Feld expressed his amazement at Perospero's craftsmanship.
As the tea party began, Lu Feld and his fellow emperors presented Big Mom with their gifts. They were excited to see the
Tamatebako
nearby and hear that Big Mom would reveal its contents after the wedding ceremony.
After Sanji and Pudding entered the venue, Stussy commented on how Pudding reminded her of her younger days. Lu Feld then asked Stussy of her age and she responded by hitting him.
During the ceremony, several copies of
Monkey D. Luffy
emerged from the cake and started causing a ruckus. Lu Feld originally thought this was a planned spectacle, but
Morgans
corrected him that it was actually an unexpected development. Lu Feld later witnessed Jinbe officially resigning from the Big Mom Pirates and was amazed when Big Mom was unable to take away Jinbe's lifespan.
Right after Brook destroyed the picture of Carmel, Lu Feld was disturbed when Brook removed his Luffy mask, thinking that he removed his actual skin. When the Big Mom Pirates revealed their treachery towards the Vinsmoke Family, Lu Feld casually commented that Germa was done for.
Lu Feld shot by Stussy's Tobu Shigan.
While enduring Big Mom's scream, Lu Feld picked up some mochi earplugs that were lying on the floor. He then prepared to open the Tamatebako and steal its contents, but Big Mom's scream caused the chest to be blown out of the Whole Cake Chateau and fall a great distance below.
After spotting the Tamatebako, which fell to a safe place on the edge of a platform, Lu Feld pondered on how to reach the chest. He was then confronted by Stussy, who questioned him on his intentions. He then slipped and fell to where the Tamatebako was. However, before he could open the chest, Stussy shot him with a
Tobu Shigan
. His unconscious body leaned on the chest, causing it to drop to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau.
