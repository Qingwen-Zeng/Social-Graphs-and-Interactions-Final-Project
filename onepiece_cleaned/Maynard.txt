History
[
]
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Maynard lies defeated by Bartolomeo.
Maynard went undercover at the
Corrida Colosseum
tournament as fighter No. 0429, using the alias "Capman". While reporting the names of competitors to his colleagues, he was discovered by
Gambia
. As Gambia questioned Maynard about what he was doing, the vice admiral hung up his
Den Den Mushi
, beat up Gambia, and then unceremoniously left the pirate in the garbage room. While washing his hands, he called back to his colleague and told him to cross Gambia's name out, saying that he was mistaken about him and there was no need to worry.
Later, just before B Block began, he was defeated by
Bartolomeo
and left inside the garbage room, in the same manner as he did Gambia earlier.
Sometime later, Vice Admiral
Bastille
tried to get in touch with Maynard, but Maynard was not able to respond.
After
Donquixote Doflamingo
trapped
Dressrosa
in his
"Birdcage"
, Maynard left the colosseum and reported to his colleagues. After receiving a scolding from Bastille, Maynard explained to Bastille and
Issho
about discovering Doflamingo's connection with the
underworld
. Maynard explained to Issho that it would be the best time to arrest Doflamingo, but Issho responded that it is not the
World Government
's role to play God in the wake of the anger-filled screams of the citizens and instructed the vice admiral to continue following his orders.
Maynard, Issho, and an army of
Marines
were later stationed at the base of the new King's Plateau apparently to hinder the
Straw Hat Pirates
from reaching Doflamingo. However, while
Monkey D. Luffy
and his allies from the colosseum were charging up the new King's Plateau, the Marines were confronted by
Sabo
.
While Issho fought Sabo, Maynard traveled to the North West Town
Primula
and lead the Marines in containing the chaos and subduing pirates looting the city.
After the defeat of the
Donquixote Pirates
, Maynard made a broadcast to Dressrosa's three neighboring countries and explained what transpired in the country itself. After the signal was confirmed, Maynard ordered a Marine to follow Issho with the Visual Den Den Mushi, which caught and broadcast the admiral's bowing and apologizing to
Riku Doldo III
and Dressrosa's citizens.
Later that night, Issho rolled a dice and decided not to capture Luffy and
Trafalgar Law
for the time being. Maynard objected to this decision, but Issho only told him to not complain.
Three days after Doflamingo's defeat, the Marines were mobilized to pursue Luffy and his allies. When Maynard heard that Luffy took
Rebecca
from the palace, he ordered his troops to capture Luffy, but they collapsed due to the side-effects of donating energy for
healing
the injured citizens.
