Chapter 396

Jaguar D. Saul
is a
giant
and former
Vice Admiral
who deserted the
Marines
and happened to wash ashore on
Ohara
.
During the
Buster Call
that destroyed Ohara 22 years ago, he risked his life to protect a young
Nico Robin
and ended up
frozen
by fellow former Vice Admiral
Kuzan
.
While Robin presumed that he had died, he had actually survived and, after collecting the books that Ohara's scholars sacrificed themselves to save, brought them to
Elbaph
and went into hiding.
Appearance
[
]
As a giant, Saul is many times larger than a
human
. He has long, orange hair and a big beard that seems to connect around his entire face, which somewhat resembled a lion's mane.
During his time as a vice admiral, Saul wore a Marine coat like all other higher-ranking Marines. However, after his defection, he discarded it. When he crash-landed on Ohara, he was wearing a black shirt and gray jeans that were a little tattered. Also, as a Marine, he had worn the Marine cap, but upon his defection he exchanged it for a cowboy's hat.
While leading a group of Elbaph giants in retrieving books from Ohara, Saul was noted to be wrapped in bandages.
Personality
[
]
Saul's unusual method of laughing.
Saul was a big and friendly giant who was somewhat shy and timid. While he was loyal to the
Marines
, he questioned their orders at least twice, which shows that he followed moral
Justice
over the code of
Absolute Justice
. In the end, it was this moral judgment that led him to betraying them, as Saul could not see why the Marines would need to slaughter an entire clan of mere archaeologists, who had no fighting chance against them. He also justified his choice of defending Robin after seeing a
former colleague
destroy an entire ship of innocent citizens, who held no related crimes to the incident at hand.
Saul was also characterized as having a unique, but awkward laugh (Dereshishishishi). He enjoyed seeing others laugh and have fun, as shown when he encouraged Robin to laugh.
Like other
"D's"
before him, he was seen laughing before his presumed death.
Relationships
[
]
Nico Robin
[
]
He was one of the three people who influenced Nico Robin. Saul was the first person to have befriended Robin (besides Ohara's archaeologists) after she found him washed up on Ohara's shore. Afterwards, Robin visited and brought food for him for several days while he built a raft to leave the island. One day, he taught and encouraged Robin to laugh whenever she was sad, even if it hurt. Seconds before what Robin thought was his death, Saul told her that she would find friends that will protect her and live with her someday. As Robin left the island, she mourns for him, not realizing he survived, along with the destruction of her home and the death of her mother.
Saul's relationship with Robin explained how she knows about the
Will of D.
After saving
Luffy
from being buried under quicksand, she questioned him about why those who have the Will of D. fight, although Luffy had no idea what she was talking about.
Robin hallucinates Saul's appearance alongside
Olvia
and
Clover
as her "most precious memories" under the effects of
Black Maria
's illusion mist.
It wouldn't be until 22 years later that Robin would learn that Saul was still alive and in hiding at
Elbaph
which she was brought to tears when
Shaka
revealed this information, despite not being able to verify Saul's name directly.
Kuzan
[
]
Saul and
Vice Admiral
Kuzan
(later known as
Admiral
Aokiji) also had a good friendship. They also shared the same sight on
Moral Justice
. Despite this, their friendship was not enough to spare Saul, though the reason Kuzan allowed Robin to live was mostly a final favor to Saul.
Nico Olvia
[
]
Saul initially had a hostile interaction with
Nico Olvia
. She berated him for murdering her colleagues and blindly complying with the World Government's policies without knowledge of the entire situation. Saul realized she was correct and it led him to question his senior officer about the prohibition on
Poneglyphs
. The lack of answers prompted him to question Olvia about her work and in disdain for the World Government's cruelty defected by releasing her. Olvia warned him that he could never return to the Marines, due to his treason. Saul responded by stating he was following his own ethics and wished her luck on her return to
Ohara
.
Olvia finally trusted him by requesting Saul to protect her daughter and evacuate her from Ohara.
Saul told Robin to be proud of her mother and the other archaeologists for their defiance of the World Government.
Giants of Elbaph
[
]
Despite not being from
Elbaph
, Saul was familiar with the giants there, considering them somewhat barbaric.
Despite this, he apparently has a good relationship with them, to the point that they helped him transport the books of Ohara and let him live on the island.
While their exact relationship is unknown, some of Elbaph's giants refer to him with the honorific "-sensei"
(
先生
?
)
.
Enemies
[
]
Marines
[
]
As a Marine officer, Saul was supposed to be loyal to the ideals and duties of the naval military. However, he questioned the orders of his commanding officer at least twice, which shows that he followed Moral Justice over the code of Absolute Justice. In the end, it was this moral judgment that led him to defecting by releasing
Nico Olvia
from prison,
as Saul could not see why the Marines would need to slaughter an entire clan of mere archaeologists, who had no fighting chance against them. He also justified his choice of defending Robin after seeing a
former colleague
destroy an entire ship of innocent citizens, who held no related crimes to the incident at hand. After the Buster Call ended, Saul undermined its purpose by saving the books that the scholars placed in a lake, preserving the knowledge that the Marines sought to destroy, while allowing
Vegapunk
to secretly read them and effectively study the forbidden
Void Century
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Saul lifting a Marine battleship at Ohara.
As a former Navy Vice Admiral, Saul had command of the lower ranking subordinates, as well as leading a Buster Call along with four other Vice Admirals. However, his defection cost him these privileges.
He had experienced the
Grand Line
and seen
Devil Fruit
users, so he was not surprised or scared by them at all. He even states that he was somewhat jealous of their incredible abilities.
He also knew how to fish for nourishment and build rafts, showing basic survival skills.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Being a giant, he possessed almost unbeatable strength, which was, in fact, greater than that of most
giants
. He could easily lift a Buster Call ship up out of the water to slam it back down and destroy it (a Buster Call ship's size was several times the size of a giant at the time). His durability was immense as well, brushing off explosions from direct cannonball hits. He was also capable of surviving being completely frozen over by then Vice Admiral Kuzan.

It was stated that all vice admirals possess
Haki
, so Saul could also use the ability.
History

Past
[

Early History
[
]
Saul is a
giant
, but not an
Elbaph
giant, as he was born somewhere in the
South Blue
.
At some point in his life, he became a
Marine
and eventually made it to the rank of
Vice Admiral
. Before the storyline, Saul had traveled in the
Grand Line
, though nothing was said of his adventures other than the fact that he met many
Devil Fruit
users.
A Storm in the Edd War
[
]
When the Marines learned that the
Roger Pirates
and the
Golden Lion Pirates
were about to battle in the
Edd War
, Saul was in
Marineford
and walked with
Garp
,
Kuzan
,
Sakazuki
, and
Tsuru
, listening to the conversation about Garp's efforts to arrest
Gold Roger
.
Ohara Incident
[
]
Saul meets the archeologist Nico Olvia.
While on duty, Saul's vessel encountered a wanted ship run by the
archaeologists
of
Ohara
, who had left
West Blue
to locate and decipher the mysterious
poneglyphs
that bear an ancient,
forgotten history
that was forbidden to be studied. Despite ordering his men to take the archaeologists alive, Saul's crew slaughtered all but one,
Nico Olvia
.
After Olvia's capture, Saul was informed by
Sengoku
that he would be one of the five chosen vice admirals to lead a
Buster Call
against Ohara for its crimes of deciphering the poneglyphs. Rejecting the study of history as a justification for the order, Saul began to doubt the
World Government
's actions. After interrogating Olvia, Saul grew disgusted with the military's brutal intentions and defected against the World Government by releasing her.
Soon after, he was shipwrecked in a storm and sent adrift in the ocean until he unknowingly landed in Ohara. There he met
Nico Robin
, whom he befriended. She visited for the next four days, while he was building a raft.
One he had finished his raft, she told him about her mother, which led Saul to realize that he was in Ohara and that Robin was Olvia's daughter. He then warned her about the battleship that was going to destroy Ohara due to the scholars having studied the Poneglyph.
Kuzan freezes Saul, while Ohara burns.
Upon seeing the battleships gathering for the
Buster Call
,
Saul rushed off to find Robin.
When he found her, she had reunited with her mother. Saul promised Olvia to protect her daughter and then carried Robin to the shore of the island, but the Marine ships spotted him and opened fire. Saul put Robin down and angrily retaliated, picking up one ship
and throwing it into another. While attacking other ships, Saul told Robin to go to the evacuation ship. When
Spandine
refused to allow her aboard, Saul charged at the
CP9
ship, but Kuzan intercepted him. Their argument about
Justice
was interrupted by the evacuation ship exploding. Saul attempted to escape with Robin, but Kuzan
froze
him in place. Before being completely encased in ice, Saul laughed and encouraged Robin to escape the island and to find friends out at sea.
The World Government believed Saul to have died during the incident, with the assumption that he helped Robin escape the island at the moment of his death.
Aftermath of Ohara
[
]
Saul meets the scientist Vegapunk.
At some point after the Ohara Incident, Saul survived both the Buster Call and being frozen by Kuzan. Freed from his frozen prison, Saul proceeded to lead a group of giants to retrieve the books that the scholars had thrown into the lake, and transported the books to
Elbaph
, where Saul went into hiding. He later relayed this knowledge to
Vegapunk
when the
scientist
visited the library on Elbaph, which set Vegapunk on a path to discover the truth of the
Void Century
.
