Appearance

said, "A couple can only look
so
much alike!" when he first saw her. Terracotta wears a dark red tunic, with a orange lining, that has a white stripe. Under her tunic is a light blue shirt with white buttons. She also wears bright red lipstick. When she cooks, she wears a white headband.
Personality

Luffy
's appetite when she was feeding the crew after their initial recovery.
Relationships
[

Igaram
[
]
Terracotta and her husband look very similar, as noted by Zoro.
She is rather strict with Igaram, scolding him for entering Vivi's dressing room when he did not knock and kicking him out when he had nothing to say to the
princess
.
Vivi
[
]
Terracotta cares deeply for Vivi, consulting her on her coming-of-age speech and reassuring her that she only has to show the people of Arabasta how she has grown rather than give a prepared statement.
Abilities and Powers

]
As the royal head chef with over 30 years of experience, Terracotta is an exceptionally skilled cook, being able to quickly cook massive portions of food to feed the Straw Hat Pirates and keep up with Luffy's appetite.

Arabasta Arc
[

When Luffy woke up after sleeping for three days, Terracotta came into the
Straw Hat Pirates
' room in the medical bay to announce their dinner. She and her subordinate brought a massive tray of food, and Luffy and Zoro mistook her for her husband. She and her team cooked for and served
Vivi
and the crew. Terracotta admired Luffy's appetite and was determined to keep up with it until it was satisfied. At the end of the meal, she smiled and wiped the sweat off her forehead with her arm, content with successfully feeding the hungry crew.
Later, she and
Maidy
dress up Vivi for the
princess
's speech.
King
Cobra
tried to enter, but she kicked him out. When
Igaram
came in to talk to Vivi, she kicked him out as well, saying that no one was allowed in. The two women spoke to Vivi about her coming-of-age speech, encouraging her to do her best.
