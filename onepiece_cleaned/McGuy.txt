"Thunder Lord" McGuy
is an infamous
New World
pirate who allied with
Whitebeard
.
Appearance
[
]
McGuy has a long face with a big nose and prominent chin, along with a defined jawline and wavy blonde hair reaching to his waist, and a black mustache shaped like a lightning bolt. He sports a blue shirt with loose sleeves and ruffled edges under a black vest. Due to his legs not being visible enough in the manga, in the anime he was given dark bermuda shorts and an orange sash decorated by a silver colored ornament with a red jewel in it.
Personality
[
]
Though little can be said regarding McGuy's personality in the manga, he is shown having huge respect towards Whitebeard instead of fleeing through the path he had cleared with his
power
.  He also seems to be very loyal with high levels of courtesy. In the anime, he was shown to be perceptive enough to see through
Sengoku
's tactic to lure the pirates in for the
Pacifista
to attack. McGuy cried tragically after the death of Whitebeard.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
McGuy has managed to make himself an infamous reputation in the New World, becoming a subordinate of Whitebeard. Also, he was very observant, as he managed to understand why Whitebeard ordered his subordinates to split up in order to avoid being trapped by the
Pacifista
. He also avoided injuries from the war.
Weapons

McGuy running electricity through his sword.
McGuy is a swordsman, although his exact level of ability remains unknown, however it is presumed quite high. His weapon of choice is a saber. He was somehow able to channel electricity through his blade, increasing the damage done; how he accomplishes this has yet to be explained, but it is likely the source for his alias. In the anime, his skill as a swordsman was enough for him to fight on equal grounds against
Vice Admiral
Doberman
to stall him.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
McGuy vs Doberman.
In the anime, McGuy was given an additional scene of fighting against Vice Admiral Doberman when Whitebeard ordered his subordinates to backup Luffy; this extra fight was not shown in the manga.
In the manga version of Whitebeard and Ace's funeral in
Chapter 590
, McGuy cannot be seen among those in attendance. However, the anime version of the exact same scene in
Episode 505
explicitly shows McGuy alongside the other attendees.
Although it can be assumed that McGuy was at the funeral, there is no visual evidence of his attendance in the manga to support this assumption and, as such, his attendance can only be considered non-canon.
