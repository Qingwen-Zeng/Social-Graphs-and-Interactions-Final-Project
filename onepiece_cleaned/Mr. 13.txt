Straw Hat Pirates

Crocus
, where they overheard
Mr. 9
and

Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
came to eliminate a spy within their organization.

Little Garden Arc

Mr. 3
and
Miss Goldenweek
. Instead, they encountered
Sanji
, who was pretending to be Mr. 3 while answering a phone call from Mr. 0. They attempted to assassinate Sanji, but he kicked Mr. 13 into the side of Mr. 3's wax house hard enough to leave an imprint and twisted Miss Friday's neck until it snapped.

The Unluckies accept a bribe from the Marines.
The Unluckies survived their encounter with Sanji and were used by the
Marines
to make drawings of the Baroque Works agents that were not captured in
Arabasta
(using a hot bowl of
donburi
as encouragement).
It is unknown what was done with them afterward.
