Whitebeard
's symbol on it. He dons a standard yellow sash as a belt, tucked inside the loops of his overalls. He is noticeably missing one of his front teeth, possibly more.

Abilities and Powers
[
]
As Commander of the 6th Division, Blamenco has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Blamenco is extremely strong, as he is seen wielding a gigantic hammer more than twice the size of his body with ease. During the Summit War of Marineford he is seen as being able to fight and defeat multiple Marine officers with one strike, and later emerge uninjured and unharmed at the end of the battle.
Devil Fruit

Main article:
Poke Poke no Mi
Blamenco has the ability to keep a gigantic hammer stored inside him.
Blamenco ate the Poke Poke no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that gives him pockets on his body. He can store objects inside of these bodily pockets, regardless of the object's size, and pull them back out when he needs them. Any limitations to this power are unknown. So far, he has only pulled out a giant mallet from his right chin pocket.
Weapons
[
]
Blamenco is capable of storing in the pockets on his body a massive
mallet
far bigger than he is. The weapon appears to be made of wood, and somewhat resembles a drum. It also could likely be based on an
≈çtsuchi
- A large, wooden hammer of Japanese origin, used mainly in the past for busting through castle gates and doors. The handle of Blamenco's mallet is quite small in comparison to the giant hammerhead. He is quite proficient with it, using one swing to defeat a large group of high-ranking Marines.
