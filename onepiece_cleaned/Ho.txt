Dr. Ho
is the palace medic of
Arabasta
's royal family. He seems to hold
Drum
medicine in high regard.
Appearance
[
]
Dr. Ho is a rather aged man, who wears a long cyan robe which covers most of his body, as well as a lilac scarf/cloak. He also wears a tall circular hat, similar to a fez, although instead of tapering into the conventional fez shape, it seems to expand in a shape similar to the center of an hourglass. He has white facial hair, which takes the form of a medium-length full beard starting below his nose carrying on past his chin. He has full lips, which are shown through his beard. He also wears circular glasses similar to those worn by
Kuro
.
Personality
[
]
Ho seems to be a very curious and well-mannered doctor, and shows great interest in other doctors, perhaps in an effort to gain more medical knowledge. He also seemed confused by
Chopper
's contradictory behavior when he praises him.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
By his own account, Ho has studied and practiced medicine for forty years. Nevertheless, his knowledge falls short of
Drum Island
's long-renowned research.
History
[

Arabasta Arc
[
]
Some days after
Arabasta
was saved from
Baroque Works
, while the
Straw Hat Pirates
were recuperating in Alubarna Palace, Dr. Ho watched
Tony Tony Chopper
compounding medicine and was immediately impressed. When informed by
Nefertari Vivi
that Chopper hailed from
Drum Island
, he became even more interested, and asked to watch Chopper's work; flattered, Chopper responded with his usual insults even as he readied tea and a seat for the older doctor.
