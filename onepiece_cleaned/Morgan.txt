"Axe-Hand" Morgan
is a former
Marine
captain
, the father of
Helmeppo
and the first significant Marine officer to appear in the storyline.
After his defeat by
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Roronoa Zoro
, he was stripped of his rank for his many abuses of power.
He is the third antagonist of the
Romance Dawn Arc
, serving as the main antagonist of the
Shells Town
subsection. He is also the main antagonist of the
Diary of Koby-Meppo
cover-page serial.
Appearance
[
]
Morgan is a notably towering, muscular man with tanned skin, blonde hair, a well-defined face, and a steel jaw etched with the word
Möwe
(German for "seagull").
As his
epithet
suggests, his right hand has been replaced with a huge steel axe, the handle of which is not only bolted through the bones of his forearm, but sticks out where his elbow should be.
Like most Marine officers, he wears a large, ornate overcoat. However, this coat notably lacks the usual "Justice"
(
正義
?
)
insignia, and is completely sleeveless; it is also worn conventionally, instead of being draped over the shoulders like a cape. His trousers bear a striped pattern reminiscent of
Marine Bases
and
battleships
.
In peacetime, he can often be seen smoking a cigar.
As a no-name Marine, Morgan had a cleft chin similar to his son’s (though this apparently developed after his youth), and his arms were both whole and a little less muscular, though he still seemed very well-built. During the attack by
Captain Kuro
, his arm was maimed and his chin shattered, necessitating his future prosthetics. He wore a standard Marine uniform, which was slashed across the front by Kuro’s signature
Cat Claws
.
After his defeat and arrest, Morgan was put into a standard striped prisoner's uniform, and shackled around the arms and legs.
While he eventually rid himself of the shackles, the prisoner's uniform has remained his last known outfit to date.
Personality
[
]
In his youth, Morgan was a brave, tenacious Marine, willing to defy enemies even on the brink of death.
In time, however, his success corrupted him until he became a brutal tyrant obsessed with his personal status and glory above all.
As such, Morgan's usual demeanor is similar to that of many
pirates
: ruling chiefly through terror, quick to threaten execution for the slightest defiance, and utterly convinced of his own infallibility.
Such is his narcissism that he considered a statue of himself (funded by taxes coerced from
Shells Town
's citizens) one of his greatest accomplishments.
Following his defeat and arrest, Morgan also displayed enough cunning to successfully escape custody. Family loyalty meant nothing to him, as he callously took his son as hostage despite the boy was, at the time, the sole person who still cared for him. What motives or goals he may have adopted since are unknown. However, he became lax enough to take a nap while sailing away.
Relationships
[
]
Family
[
]
Helmeppo
[
]
Morgan's main relation is his son
Helmeppo
. At the height of his career, he let Helmeppo act as a sort of unofficial deputy, bullying local civilians (and even subordinate Marines) under Morgan's own authority.
While Helmeppo thought this stemmed from fatherly love, Morgan never truly possessed any, and casually answered Helmeppo's complaint about being struck by
Monkey D. Luffy
with a blow of his own, adding that his son had simply not been "worth" hitting before.
This (along with seeing Morgan's willingness to kill even
children
) deeply unsettled Helmeppo's views of his father. However, their relationship did not completely collapse until some time after Morgan's defeat and imprisonment.
Uncaring that Helmeppo alone was genuinely concerned for his fate, Morgan took the boy hostage to escape custody, spurring Helmeppo to disown him and flee at the first opportunity.
Crew
[
]
What relationship Morgan initially had with his fellow Marines is unknown. Once he became commander of the
153rd Branch
, however, he tyrannized his subordinates as mercilessly as he did civilians, forcing them to collect heavy taxes and arrest—if not outright kill—anyone who displeased him. Those who disobeyed for any reason were inevitably executed as "traitors" by Morgan himself.
Due to this, the rest of the 153rd unanimously hated Morgan, rejoicing in his defeat and quickly imprisoning him afterward.
Enemies
[
]
In his youth, Morgan was the sole survivor of an attack by
Captain Kuro
of the
Black Cat Pirates
, and was subsequently
hypnotized
into thinking he had captured the infamous pirate. Neither man is known to have thought about the other since, though Morgan continues to allude to the incident as justification for his Captain rank.
Morgan's most prominent enemies are, of course, the inaugural members of the
Straw Hat Pirates
—
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Roronoa Zoro
. While condemning both for defying his rule, Morgan did not judge either a significant threat, claiming Zoro's strength was "dust" compared to his own and refusing to give in even after Luffy effortlessly outfought him.
It is unknown whether he ever changed these judgments after his defeat.
Apart from the Straw Hats, Morgan also served as an important foe for
Koby
, tempering his dream to join the
Marines
with a realization that they could be as corruptible and fallible as any men.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Even as a recruit, Morgan was notably tougher than average, surviving an onslaught from
Captain Kuro
that instantly killed dozens of other Marines (though it should be noted that not finishing him was a deliberate choice on Kuro's part).
As Captain of the 153rd, Morgan possessed notably more muscle and bulk, enough to easily lift an average-sized man by the neck, as well as complete authority over an entire base of Marine swordsmen and riflemen.
While he lost this authority after his arrest, he still maintained enough strength to burst a set of metal shackles from the inside-out.
He also possesses some knowledge of
Devil Fruits
despite their rarity in the
East Blue
, immediately identifying them as the source of
Monkey D. Luffy
's
rubber body
.
Weapons
[
]
Morgan's axe-hand is a completely functional weapon, sharp and sturdy enough to bisect an entire chain-link fence and create small fissures in the ground.
Despite its unwieldy appearance, Morgan is able to maneuver it with ease.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Kuro defeats Morgan.
Twenty two years ago, Morgan fathered a son named
Helmeppo
and led a largely unremarkable life in the
Marines
. Until an event that occurred 3 years before the the start of the story, on the fateful night his crew attacked the
Black Cat Pirates
, incurring the wrath of the infamous
Captain Kuro
. With his superhuman speed and
deadly claws
, Kuro easily massacred all of Morgan's crewmates, leaving Morgan himself just barely alive with a broken jaw and a maimed arm. The defiant Morgan refused to beg for his life, but was spared anyway, as Kuro had long schemed to retire from piracy undisturbed; Morgan, deemed an ideal pawn for this scheme, was hypnotized by
Jango
into believing that he had captured Kuro, and sent off with
a lookalike pirate
(hypnotized into believing that he was Kuro).
After "Kuro" was executed, Morgan—a mere chief petty officer at the time—was given sole credit for the capture and quickly promoted to
lieutenant commander
.
Within the next three years, his obsession with rank and power carried him even higher, until he was appointed captain of the
153rd Branch
and given absolute authority over the surrounding community of
Shells Town
.
East Blue Saga
[
]
Romance Dawn Arc
[
]
By the time
Roronoa Zoro
arrived at Shells Town, Morgan had become an outright tyrant, extracting high taxes from the townsfolk (who grew to fear the mere mention of his name) and building monuments to himself. None dared challenge his rule, as he had no qualms about killing "traitors", up to and including his own men. His son
Helmeppo
regularly exploited this, forcing the townsfolk to grovel and cater to his every whim; when Zoro refused to follow suit, even killing
Helmeppo's pet wolf
for threatening a local girl named
Rika
, Morgan indulged his son's request to have the bounty hunter arrested and starved for a month.
However, after nine days of starvation failed to break Zoro, Morgan and Helmeppo decided to execute the bounty hunter as a warning to the townsfolk. Around the same time, reports of the arrest led rookie pirate
Monkey D. Luffy
and aspiring Marine
Koby
to Shells Town, partly in hopes of recruiting Zoro. Upon arriving, the pair condemned Morgan's rule and resolved to free Zoro, and Luffy outright attacked Helmeppo after overhearing the execution plans. At first, Morgan cared little about these newcomers, even striking Helmeppo himself when urged to punish them; his wrath was instead focused on Rika, who had been caught smuggling food to Zoro that same day. To the horror of the entire base (including Helmeppo), Morgan ordered the girl executed, and immediately maimed
his closest lieutenant
for protesting.
All the while, Morgan remained unaware that Luffy had begun searching the base for Zoro's confiscated swords until Luffy forced his way onto the roof, unwittingly breaking a just-finished statue of Morgan.
Seconds later, Koby was caught trying to free Zoro, and a furious Morgan deployed his entire troop with orders to kill, only for Luffy and Zoro to easily beat them all.
His subordinates beaten, Morgan prepares to fight Luffy and Zoro himself.
Unsympathetic, Morgan ordered all of the "defeatists" to commit suicide, and tried to fight Luffy one-on-one, but found his great strength useless against the younger, faster pirate. Though the one-sided battle was interrupted by Helmeppo (who took Koby hostage with a
pistol
), Morgan was cut down by Zoro before he could press the advantage.
On seeing their captain defeated, Morgan's men immediately began celebrating, overjoyed to be free of his tyranny. Subsequently, Morgan was detained in the very base he once commanded, while
one of his former lieutenants
took charge of the 153rd Branch.

Diary of Koby-Meppo
[
]
Morgan escapes, holding Helmeppo hostage.
Eventually, Morgan was formally arraigned for his crimes by
Marine Headquarters
.
His impending court-martial became a subject of much discussion among the 153rd Branch—particularly the newly-enlisted Koby and Helmeppo, who now viewed him with a mixture of fear and compunction.
On the day of the court-martial, Morgan was transferred to an escort ship captained by the renowned
Vice-Admiral Garp
.
In mid-transfer, however, Garp fell into one of his irregular sleeping fits, and Morgan immediately seized the opening to attack the Vice-Admiral
before taking Helmeppo hostage.
This allowed Morgan to successfully escape in a lifeboat,
but destroyed the last of his relationship with his son, who openly disowned him and swam back to Garp's ship.
For his part, Morgan made no effort to pursue his son, and continued along the open sea by himself.

Early Concepts
[
]
An early Morgan design, included in
Volume 1
's bonus materials.
Eiichiro Oda
initially tried several designs intending for Morgan to look like a "crazier" version of Helmeppo, especially in chin and hairstyle. After an editor belittled these early designs as "lame," Morgan was overhauled to look more sober and intimidating, though he still shared a number of his son's physical traits.
Oda had originally conceived the name 'Chop' for Morgan, but claimed that he "didn't dare" to actually publish it (as "Sailor Chop"
(
水兵チョップ
,
Suihei choppu
?
)
sounded identical to "Horizon Chop"
(
水平チョップ
,
Suihei choppu
?
)
, the latter being a signature move of professional wrestler
Giant Baba
).
Adaptation Differences
[

Anime Differences
[
]
East Blue Saga
[
]
Morgan agitated at Luffy's bounty
In the manga, Morgan is shown openly maiming
Rokkaku
for refusing to pursue Rika, his axe-hand leaving a visible gash in Rokkaku's side. The anime somewhat censors this, omitting any visible blood and re-framing the blow to look like it came from the axe's blunt handle.
Additionally, the anime expands Morgan's reaction at Luffy's
abilities
into a full description of
Devil Fruits
(as the manga events in
Chapter 1
introducing Devil Fruits had been moved to
Episode 4
). Interestingly, he gives two examples—the
power to breathe fire
and
the power to raise tsunamis
—that inadvertently foreshadow
Portgas D. Ace
and
Edward Newgate
.
Finally, the anime adds Morgan to the interlude between the
Arlong Park
and
Loguetown arcs
, showing him inside his cell and being taunted with news of Luffy's
30,000,000 bounty by one of his former subordinates.
Diary of Koby-Meppo
[
]
Morgan's post-escape attitude is somewhat expanded by the anime, where he explicitly states his intent to (re)build a "Morgan Empire". In addition, Helmeppo—with
Koby
's help—tries to fight him instead of simply fleeing him; though Morgan easily overpowers them both, he throws them overboard instead of killing or seriously injuring them, claiming they are not worth the effort.
Live-Action Differences
[
]
In the live-action series, Morgan's personality is toned down. While he is still overly prideful, as the numerous posters and statues of him around the 153rd Branch demonstrate, he is much more charismatic and not nearly as antagonistic toward his underlings; notably, the scenes of him killing a Marine for scratching his statue as well as threatening to kill anyone who fails to capture Luffy's group are omitted.
Because of this, he remains in command of the 153rd Branch after his defeat, with his underlings having no reason to mutiny or arrest him. However, he is later arrested by Garp for lying about how Luffy's invasion of the base transpired.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
While Morgan's overall brutality is retained in the
4Kids
dub (including all of his threats against
Rika
, as well as his own men), the specific dialogue is softened in many areas. For instance, his command that his men kill themselves for hesitating against
Luffy
and
Zoro
is changed to a veiled threat for them to "shake hands" with his axe-hand.
Like most of the anime's tobacco depictions, his cigar is digitally removed in the 4Kids dub.
