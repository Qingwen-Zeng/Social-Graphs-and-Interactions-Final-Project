Ukon was walking through the
Flower Capital
when he passed a
snakeoil salesman
and brushed shoulders with the man. He suddenly noticed a slip of paper appear in his cloak, and when he pulled it out, he was shocked to see a cryptic message containing a reverse crescent moon.
Ukon joined the resistance and traveled with the Kouzuki Family's other allies to
Onigashima
, donning a

upon arrival.
When Big Mom charged at the samurai and blew a hole in the Skull Dome with
Ikoku
, Ukon was shocked and scared, crying out to ask who she was.
After

announced that
Luffy
had been defeated, Ukon watched as
Sanji
continued to fight, saving
Chopper
and their allies from
Queen
and
Perospero
's attacks.
