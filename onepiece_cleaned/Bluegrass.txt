She views the

History
[

Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
When the
World Government
had ordered to eliminate
Vegapunk
, Bluegrass, alongside
Jaygarcia Saturn
,
Kizaru
, and eight other
Vice Admirals
, led a Marine fleet to besiege the island of
Egghead
.
Before the attack, she instructed her subordinates to focus on releasing the
Cipher Pol
agents that were captive under
York
.
After arriving on the island, Bluegrass used
her Devil Fruit power
to take control of PX-III 046 and rode atop it into battle. Because of her ability, it was not affected by
Atlas
' order. When
Jewelry Bonney
was located in the Fabiriophase, Bluegrass commanded the Pacifista to fire a laser beam, but
Sanji
saved Bonney from the attack and carried her to the Vegatank.
As the Pacifista fired on the Marines due to Bonney having top command hierarchy of them, Bluegrass expressed annoyance of having to fire upon them as it would only hurt their military power. When the other Vice admirals discussed on what to do and who should kill Bonney, Bluegrass took control of a
Sea Beast Weapon
and hitched a ride on it along with
Doll
to deal with the
Giant Warrior Pirates
who arrived on the island. Bluegrass inquired on if Doll ever fought a giant before prompting Doll to reveal over 20 years ago she worked under the Giant
Vice Admiral Saul
, prompting Bluegrass to comment on how he was strong back in the day.
Bluegrass watched in shock when the rest of the
Five Elders
arrived at Egghead.
Bluegrass uses the Sea Beast Weapon to fire a laser.
Eventually, the pair made it back to the island, and moved in to confront the Giants, who were attempting to make their escape with Luffy and his allies. Bluegrass used the Sea Beast Weapon she was riding to shoot a laser into the Giant's ship, dealing significant damage to the hull.
Despite their attempts, she and Doll would both be easily dispatched by Bonney via being de-aged to children. Bluegrass herself commented on the incredible nature of Bonney's ability.
After the Straw Hats and Giant Pirates escaped Egghead, the Vice Admirals met with Saturn about what to do next. Saturn explained that their biggest concern was not the pirates, but that Vegapunk's broadcast had reached the world. However, Saturn's body suddenly started withering away by
Imu
's powers. The Vice Admirals tried to help him, but his body subsequently exploded with only his skeleton remaining.
