Anime and Manga Differences

During the pursuit of the Fire Tank Pirates, the anime showed her fleet attacking them, whereas the manga only showed Custard reporting to Mont-d'Or that she had lost sight of them.
During the Big Mom Pirates' arrival at Wano Country, Custard was not seen in the manga accompanying her mother. She is only seen alongside her siblings in the anime.
