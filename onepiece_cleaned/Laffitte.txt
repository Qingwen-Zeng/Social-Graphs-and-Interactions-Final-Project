Laffitte
,
nicknamed
"Demon Sheriff"
,
is the
navigator
,
chief of staff
,
and the Titanic Captain of the
Blackbeard Pirates
' Fifth Ship.
He is also a former
West Blue
policeman known for countless acts of police brutality, which resulted in his exile from that sea.
Due to his actions and role, he is a minor antagonist in the
Jaya Arc
, a supporting antagonist in the
Impel Down
and
Marineford Arcs
, and a major antagonist in the
Final Saga
.
Appearance
[
]
Laffitte is incredibly pale, and tap dances while he walks because of his shoes (though his black tap-dancing shoes do not seem to affect his stealthiness). He is also very tall, as much so as the majority of his crewmates, and slim. He wears an off-white collared long-sleeve shirt patterned with yellow crosses and navy jumper pants. His most distinguishing accessories are his classic black top hat and red wooden cane, with which he also wears a pair of gold hoop earrings. His lips are abnormally dark red.
After becoming the captain of the fifth fleet, he added a new black (white in the anime) cape with feathered collar to his attire.
Personality
[
]
Laffitte lived in
West Blue
and worked as a sheriff, but was exiled because he was excessively cruel and violent.
In contradiction to his past, Laffitte now seems to be a calm and affable individual that is constantly smiling. He apparently did not attempt to assist in fighting alongside his crew when
Portgas D. Ace
attacked, whistling as he ran away with the rest of the crew to a safe watching distance.
When Teach ordered his crew to attack, Laffitte gleefully smiled as he shot Whitebeard to death, and also when Teach used his new-found Gura Gura no Mi to wretched havoc on the already devastated Marineford as Teach taunted the Marines about sinking their Headquarters.
Despite being a malevolent pirate, Laffitte has an extremely refined and sophisticated personality, always speaking in a polite and courteous manner even when threatening people such Avalo Pizarro for wanting to replace Teach as captain. He also reprimanded Burgess for his habit of referring Teach as "captain" instead of "admiral".
Like the rest of the
Blackbeard Pirates
, Laffitte believes strongly in luck, fate, and dreams.
Relationships
[
]
Marshall D. Teach
[
]
Laffitte seems to be very loyal to his captain
Marshall D. Teach
, as seen when he jokingly threatened to kill
Avalo Pizarro
who suggested he should replace Teach as captain of the crew,
or when he had to keep reminding Burgess that he should address Teach as "admiral" instead of "captain".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As a former sheriff, Laffitte had authority and power over citizens. However, due to his extreme cruelty, he lost this authority when he was exiled.
After the time-skip, he is officially the Captain of the
Blackbeard Pirates
5th fleet/ship and part of a group of
Ten Titanic Captains
that personally guard the
Emperor
,
Blackbeard
.
Although his combat abilities are unknown, he must be someone very powerful. The fact, that
Blackbeard
refuses to accept any weakling in his crew, even going so far as to reject
Super Rookie
Jewelry Bonney
with a bounty of
140,000,000, is further testament to Laffite's power. He seems to have confidence in his abilities as he threatened to kill
Avalo Pizarro
, one of the most powerful criminals in Level 6.
He was also quickly recognized by Vice Admiral
Tsuru
.
It was stated during the Marineford Arc that he was able to hypnotize Marines to open the Gates of Justice for him.
Stealth Master
[
]
Laffitte is considerably skilled in infiltration. When he traveled to
Mary Geoise
, he easily bypassed all the security defenses of the sacred land of the World Government and joined in the meeting for the new Warlord of the Sea nomination, all without being noticed until he willingly revealed himself, a notable feat considering he was able to sneak past a number of high ranking Marines and three Warlords who each boast considerable degrees of
sensory Haki
, while wearing tap shoes no less (anime-only feature).
Later at Marineford, before the Blackbeard Pirates sailed to Impel Down, Laffitte infiltrated the control room to hypnotize the Marines present there without being noticed.
Navigational Skills
[
]
As a navigator,
Laffitte guides the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates through the open seas. His level of navigational skills are as of yet unknown, though it is expected he is a significantly skilled navigator to navigate through the
Grand Line
including the seas of the New World. Interestingly enough, despite his occupation, he is not seen carrying a
Log Pose
, which is essential for navigating in the Grand Line.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Laffitte is able to quickly move in a similar fashion to the
Soru
technique as shown in Blackbeard's fight with Ace.
Laffitte has been shown to possess a large amount of endurance being able to continue fighting even after taking one of Whitebeard's
Gura Gura no Mi
shockwaves (albeit not a direct hit)
and a direct hit from Fleet Admiral Sengoku's shockwaves with the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Laffitte using angel-like wings to fly.
Laffitte has eaten an unnamed
Devil Fruit
and shown that he can transform his arms into a pair of bird-like wings, though it has not been confirmed if this is the Fruit's ability or a power separate from it.
He demonstrated this ability when the
Blackbeard Pirates
invaded
Impel Down
.
Weapons
[
]
Laffitte carries a cane that he spins to accompany his tap-dancing from time to time;
it is yet unknown if it can be used as a weapon. Laffitte was using a pistol when he helped to murder
Whitebeard
.
He was also seen holding it while keeping Marine soldiers away from Blackbeard.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Laffitte used to be a sheriff in the
West Blue
, but he became a pirate after being removed from the police force and exiled from the West Blue for being excessively violent and unnecessarily cruel to his protectorates.
He was eventually invited to join the
Blackbeard Pirates
as the navigator.
Sometime after joining
Blackbeard
's crew, Laffitte and the entire crew attacked
Drum Island
forcing the cowardly
King Wapol
to flee.

Jaya Arc
[
]
Laffitte sneaks into the meeting in Mary Geoise.
Blackbeard
sends Laffitte to
Mary Geoise
to propose his name as
Crocodile
's successor in
Warlords of the Sea
.
Once he arrives at the
castle,
he interrupts
Dracule Mihawk
, excusing himself to those present and asking if they don't mind that he is joins the meeting, adding that he did not expect so many renowned individuals to be there.
Sengoku
asks who he is, and the pirate says he is aware the World Government is looking for a new Warlord after Crocodile was stripped of his title.
Tsuru
recognises him and tells Sengoku about his violent past, Laffite shows little concern for this, simply stating that he is there to recommend a certain person as Warlord.
Laffitte proposes that his captain, Teach, should serve as Crocodile's replacement. However, Sengoku is unconvinced that someone of so little renown would be intimidating enough as a Warlord. Laffite replies that they are aware of this issue, and actively working to correct it and bring up Teach's notoriety. Laffitte then leaves the Mary Geoise castle, remarking that they would do well to remember the name "
Blackbeard Pirates
".
Water 7 Saga
[
]
Post-Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
As the crew ransacked a village on the
Banaro Island
, Blackbeard reads a
newspaper
and reveals to his crew that the
Straw Hats
have wreaked havoc on
Enies Lobby
, noting that
Luffy
's bounty will be greatly increased. Lafitte then comments on how Enies Lobby is connected by a
Sea Train
to
Water Seven
and
Van Augur
claims that he is not far from where they are, so the crew prepare to go after them. Just then, however, appears
Portgas D. Ace
to confront them.
After Ace turns down Blackbeard's offer to join the crew, he watches as Van Augur and
Burgess
attack him. At that moment, Ace uses
Hiken
to attack the crew, where Laffite manages to dodge it, before retreating along with the other crew members on the orders of Ace's captain. Later, he and the rest of his crew stayed on the sidelines to watch the fight between Blackbeard and Ace.
Summit War Saga
[

Impel Down Arc
[
]
Blackbeard's pirates arrive at Impel Down
The Blackbeard Pirates sailed to
Impel Down
and Laffitte hypnotized the guards at the
Gates of Justice
to open for all battleships.
While
Monkey D. Luffy
was rioting on Level 4 on his way back out of the prison, the Blackbeard Pirates arrived at Impel Down. They forced their way into the great prison with obvious hostility.
As they made their way through Level 1, they encountered former Head Jailer
Shiryu
, and then made their way down to Level 4, where they encountered the escaping prisoners.
Laffitte stood by as Blackbeard and Luffy briefly fought. After exchanging words with the prisoners, the Blackbeard Pirates continued on their way to the lower levels and confronted Chief Warden
Magellan
, who poisoned them with his
Hydra technique
.
Later, the whole crew was saved by an antidote from Shiryu, who accepted Blackbeard's offer and joined their crew.
When they reached Level 6, the Blackbeard Pirates had the prisoners fight to the death with the survivors joining the crew.
Marineford Arc
[
]
The Blackbeard Pirates dealing the death blow to Whitebeard.
Laffitte was spotted along with the other members of the
Blackbeard Pirates
, new and old, on the execution platform where they arrived to watch the events unfold on the battlefield. Blackbeard, who had apparently brought his crew back to
Marineford
so that he could witness
Whitebeard
's death, exclaimed that he was happy to have arrived in time to do so.
Laffitte revealed to
Sengoku
that he hypnotized the Marines in the control room of the Gates of Justice. After Blackbeard confronted Whitebeard, the Blackbeard Pirates attacked Whitebeard to death.
After Whitebeard died, Laffitte assisted his crewmates in covering Whitebeard with a black cloth and guarded Blackbeard as he started to demonstrate his powers. He warned the marines that there was no entry. When Blackbeard later emerged and demonstrated the power of the
Gura Gura no Mi
, Laffitte laughed at the confusion it caused amongst their enemies.
Sengoku in
his Buddha form
then attacked the Blackbeard Pirates, blasting them with shockwaves.
While Blackbeard fought against Sengoku and
Monkey D. Garp
,
Red-Haired Shanks
arrived on the battlefield.
The Blackbeard Pirates decided to leave rather than fight the
Red Hair Pirates
.
Post-War Arc
[
]
Blackbeard Pirates Flee from Akainu.
The crew made their move in the New World, taking out
Jewelry Bonney
in the process. The crew was seen bickering amongst each other.
Avalo Pizarro
tried to declare himself the captain, but Laffitte threatened to kill him and reminded him that they are the "Blackbeard Pirates". The
Blackbeard Pirates' raft
was brought close to the point of destruction, due to
Sanjuan Wolf
's size, and they seemingly got in contact with the Marines, to trade Jewelry Bonney for a battleship. Van Augur alerted Teach that the battleship had arrived, but not for trade because
Akainu
was on board. Knowing that the deal would not happen, the Blackbeard Pirates fled, leaving Bonney and
her crew
behind to be arrested.
During the Timeskip
[
]
One year after the war at Marineford, the Blackbeard Pirates
fought against
the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates and ultimately won.
The Blackbeard Pirates used Teach's knowledge of Whitebeard's former territory to conquer it. Now that Blackbeard had become an
Emperor
, the Blackbeard Pirates were hunting down powerful
Devil Fruit
users in order to absorb their abilities. Eventually after the Blackbeard Pirates expanded into a fleet, Laffitte became one of the
"Ten Titanic Captains"
and assumed command of the Blackbeard Pirate's fifth ship earning the nickname "Demon Sheriff".
The Blackbeard Pirates party with Kuzan after their initial encounter.
At some point the crew encountered
Kuzan
on some Island and after a brief skirmish they all started having a drinking session and having a good laugh. The crew then started taking about "
the man with the burn mark
" that could lead them to the fourth and final
Road Poneglyph
that is needed to reach
Laugh Tale
. Laffitte mentioned to Kuzan that the man sailed in an all-black ship and could create ocean vortexes to destroy any ship that got close to him. Laffitte then suggested to Teach that they should kill the former Marine
Admiral
in order to gain the power of the
Hie Hie no Mi
but instead Teach invited Kuzan to join the crew and Kuzan who wanted to live on his own terms accepted.
The Blackbeard Pirates managed to make the island
Hachinosu
their base of operations after
Trafalgar Law
instigated the
Rocky Port Incident
.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Zou Arc
[
]
Laffitte speaks with Burgess over a Den Den Mushi.
After
Doflamingo
's defeat, the Blackbeard Pirates stopped by
Dressrosa
but were unable to find Burgess. At a certain sea in the New World, Laffitte and Shiryu were contacted by Burgess via
Den Den Mushi
. Burgess informed them that he stowed away on a ship that led him to the
Revolutionary Army
's base on
Baltigo
, and Laffitte had to remind Burgess that "Captain Teach" now went by the name "Admiral Teach". Burgess requested
Doc Q
's help, as he had been critically wounded by
Sabo
. He then told them to inform Teach and get the Blackbeard Pirates to attack the island.
The Blackbeard Pirates later attacked Baltigo, destroying the island by the time the Marines and
Cipher Pol
arrived, but the Revolutionary Army was able to escape. However, the Blackbeard Pirates fled after briefly clashing with Cipher Pol.
Final Saga
[
]
Elbaph Arc
[
]
Sometime before or after the Marines' raid on Hachinosu, Laffitte took on the task of keeping track of the Revolutionary Army, perching himself at
Umit Shipping
. He would be contacted by his captain, and informed him that the Revolutionaries had been sabotaging all of
bondolas
heading up to Mary Geoise, causing the
World Nobles
a food crisis. Laffitte was amused by the nature of the Revolutionaries' actions, but quickly moved to prepare for something, at the orders of Teach.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, Laffitte was first depicted as an average-size man, smaller than the rest of his crew. This mistake was not corrected during the battle between Blackbeard and Ace in Banaro Island, even when it was clear in the manga that he was as tall as his crew members. Only in the invasion of Impel Down and Battle of Marineford was his size accurately depicted in the anime.
Laffitte's hair was drawn differently in his first appearance. In his debut, his hair seemed slightly shorter and was somewhat unkempt at the end, but in his second appearance it is completely straight.
