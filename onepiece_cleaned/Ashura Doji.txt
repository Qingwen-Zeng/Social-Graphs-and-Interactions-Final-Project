Ashura Doji
was a former
bandit
, a
samurai
from
Wano Country
and a retainer of the
Kouzuki Family
, serving as one of
Kouzuki Oden
's
Nine Red Scabbards
.
After Oden's death, he returned to being a criminal under the name
Shutenmaru
,
assuming leadership of the
Mt. Atama Thieves
.
He initially severed his ties with the Kouzuki Family in the present but rejoined after witnessing
Yasuie
's death.
Ashura eventually met his demise during the
Raid on Onigashima
, sacrificing himself to protect his fellow Scabbards from one of
Kanjuro
's schemes.
He is an ally of the
Straw Hat Pirates
during the
Wano Country Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Ashura Doji was a very large man with light pink puffy hair that was gathered into a topknot. He wore an open kimono with flowers on it that left his chest exposed. He had floral tattoos on his arms and upper chest.
Personality
[
]
Ashura studying to improve himself despite great difficulties.
Ashura was once an extremely violent and dangerous outlaw. He claimed that he hated people with a higher status than him. After being defeated by
Kouzuki Oden
, who chose to spare his life and offered him a chance to live a peaceful life by rebuilding Kuri, Ashura became one of his most loyal followers out of immense gratitude. He and the other Nine Red Scabbards attempted to steal money from
Shimotsuki Yasuie
to support Oden.
Ashura was even willing to study hard to improve himself on Oden's behalf.
Ashura was an extremely loyal person, as he referred to Oden as "Oden-sama" even after his death.
His dedication was also seen when he patiently tried to assemble an army of samurai to support the
Kouzuki Family
and continued to believe in Toki's prophecy ten years after her death.
He was also courageous and almost fearless. When he encountered
Jack
in
Okobore Town
, the then ruler of
Kuri
and one of the
Beasts Pirates
' All-Stars, the former was not afraid to attack the latter immediately and did not even fear Jack's reputation. However, he was cautious of
Kaidou
's strength, but he would have fought back against him if only to create an opening for his escape.
Ashura was also a very caring person. When the samurai he had gathered tried to attack Kaidou at
Onigashima
, he cried and tried to stop them, but his words were in vain because they did not listen.
After losing the last of his comrades, Ashura finally lost hope and returned to being a criminal under the alias Shutenmaru and formed a
group of thieves
because he was disillusioned and nihilistic towards the state of the country.
After returning to being a criminal, he became an aggressive and prideful person. He stole from both Wano's wealthiest and poorest citizens for the same self-sufficiency motives. He also did not care what would happen to his country due to the lack of strong and noble people like Oden. As such, Ashura was disgusted with Luffy's heroism in feeding the citizens of
Okobore Town
. He also initially refused to rejoin the Kouzuki Family after they returned for their campaign to overthrow Kaidou and Orochi, accusing them of abandoning Wano Country. Ironically, his cynicism was what prevent him from falling into Kanjuro’s scheme into believing the fake Oden even though he wished it was him. Despite his callous behavior and nihilism towards the citizens of Wano, Ashura still had some compassion, as he secretly felt sympathy towards the citizens of Ebisu Town, who had lost the ability to express sadness and anger from eating the SMILEs that Orochi manipulated them into eating. He was also distraught when Yasuie was executed, showing that he still cared greatly for those that were his comrades.
After deciding to rejoin the Nine Red Scabbards, Ashura became friendly with his comrades again, though he still bickered with them from time to time.
He ultimately chose to sacrifice himself to prevent Kanjuro's explosives from killing the other Scabbards.
Ashura was one of the few samurai known to still use
Sunacchi
, which was once part of the old dialect of Kuri in Wano Country. Ashura and his men used it frequently amongst themselves and in battle.
Ashura seemed to enjoy drinking alcohol.
In the past, he also drank blood from a decapitated snake.

Kouzuki Family and Nine Red Scabbards
[
]
Ashura, alongside the other Red Scabbards (with Izou taking Kanjuro's place), charges into battle.
In the past, when
Kuri
was a lawless region, Ashura Doji was confronted by
Kouzuki Oden
, the son of Shogun
Kouzuki Sukiyaki
. After an entire night of intense battle, he was finally defeated. Despite wishing to die by Oden's hands as part of his own choice to live and die in violence, Oden chose to spare Ashura and reformed him by enlisting his help in bringing order to Kuri. Thus, Ashura is extremely grateful to Oden for showing him a possible future to live in peace, though he was irritated when Oden kicked him in the face when he expressed his gratitude. He and the other retainers attempted to steal money from the daimyo
Shimotsuki Yasuie
to support Oden. Even after his death, Ashura still refers to him as "Oden-sama", showing undying respect and loyalty to the daimyo of Kuri.
Ashura and the other retainers also seemed to get along well.
However, after the fall of the Kouzuki Family, Ashura tried to support his allies by gathering samurai, even though it ended up in vain due to them growing impatient and attacking Onigashima, which led to their deaths. This led him to sever his ties with the Kouzuki Family.
Later, after the missing
Nine Red Scabbards
returned, their relationship became strained. Ashura became angered and frustrated at
Kin'emon
and the others for having vanished for so long. Ashura said that he only respects and is loyal to someone named Oden, not to his family. In truth, he was angered because some of his comrades died in vain ten years ago. His resentment toward the family was so much that he even referred to Momonosuke, who is Oden's son, without any honorifics, resulting in Kikunojo expressing her disappointment. The closest to any camaraderie Ashura expressed was that he spared them from his banditry. However, Kin'emon made it clear that he would make Ashura their ally and had no qualms framing him for theft.
This only made Ashura angrier after he found out about it, but he was still lenient enough to listen to Kin'emon's apology and pleas. Ashura then showed Kin'emon and Inuarashi the graves of fallen comrades and explained what happened to their allies after they had lost patience in waiting for their return. Ashura finally rejoined the Scabbards and invited his bandit group to take part in the fight against Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates.
Mt. Atama Thieves
[
]
All the members of the Mt. Atama Thieves were extremely loyal and supportive of Shutenmaru, aiding him in stealing and robbing. When Shutenmaru decided to join the Kouzuki Family's revolution, all his underlings happily agreed to join him.
Enemies
[
]
Beasts Pirates
[
]
Ten years ago, Ashura tried gathering forces to support the Kouzuki Family in the fight against Kaidou. However, after his comrades threw their lives away, Ashura lost hope and seemingly gave up.
Kaidou recognized his strength and wanted him to join his crew, but Ashura had no intention of joining and pledging loyalty to the
Beasts Pirates
. However, he is well aware of Kaidou's strength and would try to avoid him whenever possible.
Despite him being intimidated by Kaidou, he is not afraid to pick fights with the Emperor's subordinates. When Ashura encountered Jack in Okobore Town, the former did not hesitate to attack the latter and did not even fear his reputation.
Kaidou was initially unaware of Ashura's connection with the Kouzuki Family until he saw him in person, as he only knew him as a thief called Shutenmaru.
Kurozumi Kanjuro
[
]
Ashura was previously on good terms with
Kanjuro
, as they both served as faithful vassals of Oden. However, Kanjuro later revealed that he was of the
Kurozumi Family
, that he was a spy sent by Orochi all along, and that he was the one who revealed the
alliance's
plans to Orochi greatly shocking Ashura alongside the other Scabbards present. Ashura was angry when Kanjuro captured Momonosuke after Kin'emon failed to kill him.
Ultimately, Ashura died to protect his fellow Scabbards from one of Kanjuro's traps when he took the full brunt of the explosion personally.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Overview
[
]
As the leader of the
Mt. Atama Thieves
, Ashura Doji had complete authority over the group. He had excellent leadership skills, as he successfully led his bandits on missions to raid Orochi's
Paradise Farm
multiple times, though his group eventually came under suspicion.
25 years ago, while Oden was away with the Whitebeard Pirates, Ashura assumed control of the
yakuza
in Kuri as the new yakuza boss, and kept both the yakuza and bandits in the region from going out of control.
Combat-wise, Ashura was a mighty samurai, once feared as the "Strongest Monster of
Kuri
"
(
九里最強の怪物
,
Kuri Saikyō no Kaibutsu
?
)
—the most dangerous villain frequenting said region during its era of chaos—until he was defeated by Oden four decades ago (the latter taking a whole night to take down both Ashura and his then-cohorts).
Even more, in the last 20 years, Ashura claims to have become stronger.
Kin'emon
hailed Ashura as one of the strongest Scabbards (alongside
Kawamatsu
and
Denjiro
) and worth 100 men in battle.
Kaidou
himself, an
Emperor
, sought to recruit him
and
Holed'em
, a
Shinuchi
of the
Beasts Pirates
, surmised that
Monkey D. Luffy
must have been Ashura's subordinate going by his power.
Perhaps most impressively, Ashura was able to fight evenly against the
All-Star
Jack
, a top henchman of Kaidou with a bounty of
1,000,000,000, even dealing him a severe wound,
and fought evenly with
Inuarashi
, one of the two strongest warriors of the
Mink Tribe
, in a sparring match.
However, Ashura was well aware that he had no chance against Kaidou by himself, preferring to retreat when faced with him a second time.
By combining his power with that of three other Scabbards, he was able to seriously injure Kaidou in his
dragon form
.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Ashura was capable of applying tremendous physical power to his swordsmanship, as he matched Inuarashi and Jack in strength, even giving the latter a massive wound across his chest.
Alongside his fellow Scabbards, Ashura managed to push
Kaidou
off his feet when ambushing him.
Even after being brutally defeated by Kaidou, he retained enough strength to tackle Kanjuro's drawing of Oden through a wall.
Despite his large build, Ashura was extremely fast, as shown when he charged toward
Jack
in an instant.
Ashura had great endurance and a tolerance for pain, as he was seemingly unaffected when Jack cut him on the shoulder and survived being stabbed in the back by
King
.
Similarly, he quickly recovered after being impaled by Kanjuro's drawing and exhibited no discomfort as he was stabbed multiple times.
Swordsmanship
[
]
Further information:
Oden Two Sword Style
Ashura, alongside three other Scabbards, wields Oden Two Sword Style against Kaidou.
Ashura was a highly skilled and powerful swordsman. With one slash, he gave Jack a large cut across his chest and broke one of his shotel blades. He then proceeded to fight evenly with the pirate in what spectators considered to be a high-level duel.
He was capable of emulating Oden's signature
Oden Two Sword Style
style, allowing him to wield two swords at the same time and perform one of his techniques.
Haki
[
]
Main article:
Haki
Armament Haki
[
]
Ashura was a master of
Armament Haki
, known as "Ryuo" in Wano. He could harden his swords and also possessed an advanced level of this Haki, as shown when he cut through Kaidou's tremendously tough skin.
Observation Haki
[
]
Ashura possessed the ability to use
Observation Haki
.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Ashura and his goons defeated by Oden.
Many years ago, Ashura Doji was the most dangerous criminal in the lawless region of
Kuri
. When he heard that
Kouzuki Oden
was coming to Kuri, Ashura eagerly waited for him. After Oden eventually arrived at Kuri, they clashed and Ashura was defeated after a day of intense fighting.
After Oden became
daimyo
of Kuri, Ashura became one of his retainers.
After
Inuarashi
,
Nekomamushi
, and
Kawamatsu
joined Oden, they were running low on funds. Therefore, he and the other retainers attempted to steal money from
Shimotsuki Yasuie
, but they were caught. Instead of punishing them, Yasuie allowed them to take the money and encouraged them to use it to become better people for the sake of Oden and
Wano Country
.
Following Yasuie's advice, they educated themselves and trained to become dignified warriors. 30 years ago, they visited the
Flower Capital
with Oden.
After meeting the
Whitebeard Pirates
, Oden and his retainers were having a feast with them. When the Whitebeard Pirates left Wano two weeks later, the retainers discovered Oden,
Izou
, Inuarashi, and Nekomamushi to be missing.
While Oden was away, Ashura lead the
yakuza
and the
bandits
in Kuri to keep them from going out of control.
After Oden failed to kill the new
shogun
,
Kurozumi Orochi
, 25 years ago, the retainers remained loyal to him for the next five years despite Oden acting like a fool and losing the respect of most of Wano's people. 20 years ago, Oden finally had enough and decided to take down
Kaidou
. The
Nine Red Scabbards
eagerly followed him and marched with him to
Onigashima
.
On the way to Onigashima, the group was confronted by Kaidou and his
crew
in the
Udon
region. In the ensuing battle, the
samurai
were joined by
Shinobu
. After seeing Oden struck down by Kaidou, Ashura was stabbed in the back. Unfortunately, the samurai were overwhelmed in the end. Oden and the Scabbards were then imprisoned in the Flower Capital and sentenced to be boiled alive in three days.
Ashura and Denjiro face Kaidou.
All ten prisoners were later brought to the execution site, at which point Oden made a deal with Kaidou. After Oden stepped into the pot of boiling oil, the retainers were about to join him, but Oden grabbed a plank and ordered them to stand on it as he held them over the pot.
As Oden endured the
hour
, he explained to his retainers the reason Wano Country was isolated and requested them to open Wano's borders for him. Oden successfully survived the hour, but Orochi summoned a firing squad to execute Oden and his retainers. Oden once again told his retainers to open Wano's borders before throwing them far away from the pot. The Scabbards fled with tears as Oden met his demise.
As they were chased by an army of pursuers, Shinobu gave the Scabbards their
weapons
. After Inuarashi and Nekomamushi were caught, Ashura and
Denjiro
split from the rest of the group to fight their enemies.
At some point, Ashura and Denjiro fought Kaidou. Ashura was able to escape and hid in the mountains.
Ashura watches his comrades sail to their doom while he hopelessly tries to stop them.
Ten years after Oden's death, Ashura had many friends who became too eager to fight Kaidou and Orochi and did not fully believe
Toki
's prophecy about the
return
of the missing Red Scabbards. Thus, they impatiently went straight to Onigashima to fight Kaidou. Ashura tried to stop them from throwing their lives away, but these words were in vain, and his comrades ultimately perished at the hands of Kaidou.
Distraught at his comrades' pointless demise, Ashura eventually lost hope, went back to being a criminal, and adopted the alias Shutenmaru.
He also formed the
Mt. Atama Thieves
. At some point, he encountered Kaidou, in which Kaidou wanted him to be part of his crew.
Ashura also managed to acquire the blueprints of Kaidou's fortress within the
Skull Dome
.
A few weeks before
Monkey D. Luffy
's arrival at Wano Country, Ashura and other thieves managed to steal
food
from the
farm
that Oden had established, which was now owned by Orochi.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Ashura Doji attacks Jack.
Ashura and his thieves came to Okobore Town, where they stole the fresh food that Luffy had given to the residents there. He was confronted by an old woman who believed that the samurai would return to protect them, and in response, Ashura prepared to attack her. However, before he could, he was confronted by
Jack
of the
Beasts Pirates
. Jack asked about the
Straw Hat Pirates
and mentioned that Ashura had only been left alive because
Kaidou
wanted him as his subordinate. He reiterated that he would never join them and then attacked Jack with a massive cut, causing the two to begin fighting. Jack managed to wound Ashura, but he was unwavering. However, their duel was interrupted when Kaidou came flying in to tell Jack to bring the Straw Hats to him.
Ashura and his gang then began retreating to the forest. Kaidou spotted him and asked him to become his subordinate. Ashura prepared for a fight, but
Basil Hawkins
drew Kaidou's attention to Oden Castle. The thief was then angry at Kaidou for destroying the castle ruins,
and after Luffy attacked Kaidou, Ashura told his men to retreat to the mountain before watching Luffy's futile attempt to defeat Kaidou.
After Kaidou defeated Luffy, Ashura saw the unconscious Luffy knocking out some of the
Emperor
's subordinates with
Supreme King Haki
and realized he had the same power as Oden. He then departed from Okobore Town.
Ashura clashes with Inuarashi as he refuses to help the Kouzuki Family again.
At Mt. Atama, Ashura clashed with Inuarashi, but the fight was interrupted by
Kin'emon
. Ashura stated that while he admired Oden, he never swore loyalty to the entire
Kouzuki Family
. However, Kin'emon ignored this claim and emphasized that he was determined to make Ashura their ally once again.
Sometime later, Mt. Atama was set on fire by one of
Holed'em
's subordinates. Enraged, Ashura decided to go to Bakura Town to retaliate.
He and his gang later entered Bakura Town and witnessed
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's execution on the broadcast.
After the execution, he was the only one of the
Nine Red Scabbards
to hold his tears after Yasuie's death, and thereafter asked Kin'emon and Inuarashi if they knew about the
SMILE
fruits.
Outside Bakura Town, Ashura learned that Kin'emon framed him for theft. He got angry and knocked Kin'emon to the ground. Kin'emon and Inuarashi apologized and once again asked Ashura to join them. Ashura then told Kin'emon and Inuarashi to follow him, wanting to show them something.
When they arrived, Ashura showed them the graves of their dead comrades and explained what had happened to their allies ten years ago. He recounted how they had all lost patience and had tried to fight Kaidou, but were all killed in battle. Ashura then determined that it was time for him to rejoin his comrades to avenge those who had fallen and to also overthrow Kaidou and Orochi to restore the position of the Kouzuki Family. Inuarashi and he then rejoiced and bragged to Kin'emon about how they had twenty years more fighting experience than him now. Upon being called a duo of geezers by Kin'emon, the three began arguing, much to the worry of Ashura's henchmen.
Ashura later took Kin'emon and Inuarashi to an abandoned port and showed them ships that could carry their troops to Onigashima.
Ashura then gave Kin'emon the blueprints of Kaidou's residence. While Kin'emon was speaking to
Raizo
via
Smart Tanishi
, Ashura was surprised to hear the number of allies Raizo's group gained at Udon.
He later joined a meeting with several key alliance members at Amigasa Village.
Ashura then heard from
Roronoa Zoro
and
Kawamatsu
that
Kouzuki Hiyori
is alive. On the day for the raid on Onigashima, Ashura marched to the rebel meeting place with
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, Kin'emon,
Kanjuro
, Raizo,
Kikunojo
, Shinobu, Inuarashi, and Kawamatsu.
However, the group was shocked to see that Tokage Port was destroyed and none of their allies were there.
In spite of this major setback, the Scabbards were still determined to go through with the raid, knowing that they would not get another chance.
The Scabbards set sail and left Momonosuke at the port. As Kin'emon wondered about the possibility of a traitor among them, Kanjuro then revealed that he was the mole, leaving the other Scabbards stunned at this revelation. After Kanjuro explained what he did, Kin'emon angrily beheaded him, only to learn that it was a copy and the real Kanjuro remained on the coast and that he had captured Momonosuke to bring him to Onigashima. As this was happening, the Scabbards' boat was confronted by three Beasts Pirates' ships, but the ships were suddenly attacked by the Straw Hats,
Heart Pirates
, and
Kid Pirates
. The Scabbards' boat was then lifted by
Law's submarine
.
When Kyoshiro arrived, the Scabbards were confused to see him attacking one of the Beasts Pirates' ships. They were then shocked when Kyoshiro revealed himself to be Denjiro and that he freed the prisoners in the Flower Capital and the rebels gathered at Habu Port. To their relief, the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
allies arrived at Tokage Port on a massive fleet to commence the raid on Onigashima.
Kanjuro then fled the scene with Momonosuke in tow on a drawn crane and briefly attacked the alliance with an ink cloud that rained down ink arrows. Momonosuke ordered the alliance to press forward to Onigashima without worrying about him. As the alliance was attacked by a Beasts Pirates' ship with long ranged cannons,
Jinbe
came to aid the rebels.
After
Shishilian
and
Hyougoro
boarded the Polar Tang, the Scabbards discussed with
Trafalgar Law
about the plan to enter Onigashima.
After the Straw Hats defeated the guards at the torii gates, the Heart Pirates and the Scabbards (except Kin'emon and Denjiro) traversed to the back of Onigashima inside the Polar Tang.
Along the way, they were contacted by Nekomamushi, who just arrived and was planning to meet them at Onigashima.
When the submarine got close enough, Law
teleported
himself and the Scabbards with him to Onigashima's back entrance, where they were joined up by
Marco
, Nekomamushi, and
Izou
.
After Marco left to check on a shadow he saw at sea, the group was confronted by Kanjuro and an army of Beasts Pirates. While Kikunojo clashed against Kanjuro, the rest fought the other enemies.
The Scabbards attack Kaidou.
Kanjuro and the Beasts Pirates with him were defeated, and Ashura's group were soon rejoined by Kin'emon and Denjiro. They then entered Kaidou's castle, fought their way to the Performance Stage, and launched an all-out attack on Kaidou.
While falling to the lower floor, the Scabbards managed to inflict wounds on Kaidou. As the alliance revealed themselves and attacked the Beasts Pirates, Kaidou transformed into
his dragon form
and flew to the roof of the Skull Dome, with the Scabbards grabbing onto him. On the roof, the Scabbards prepared to fight Kaidou with the
Mink Tribe
's help.
Jack and a platoon arrived at the roof to assist Kaidou, and the Scabbards watched as the
Sulong
minks engaged the enemy.
After Jack and his forces were rendered unable to battle thanks to the minks' efforts, the Scabbards resumed their confrontation with Kaidou.
Ashura and three other Scabbards slash Kaidou's scar.
Kaidou roared lightning at them, but they dodged around it and each struck him in turn. After Raizo reflected Kaidou's Bolo Breath back at him, four of the Scabbards—Ashura, Denjiro, Kin'emon, and Inuarashi—replicated
Oden's Two Sword Style
stance and struck Kaidou's scar with the same attack that made it.
Kaidou then retaliated with a roar that created wind scythes aimed at the Scabbards.
Continuing the battle in human form, Kaidou began overwhelming the Scabbards
and later incapacitated them.
Big Mom
,
Eustass Kid
, Killer, Zoro, Luffy, and Law later arrived at the roof. Upon Luffy's request, Law teleported the Scabbards to a safe place.
They were placed in the treasure room on the second floor, where Hiyori, who had previously infiltraded Onigashima, tended to them.
Ashura lies dead after sacrificing himself.
The Scabbards later recovered and regained consciousness, but the mysterious figure already had left. Before they left the treasure room, they were shockingly greeted by what appeared to be Oden.
However, Ashura immediately suspected that this was an impostor and told this to his comrades who believed it was legitimate. When Kin'emon tried arguing against this, Ashura punched him out of the way while unsheathing his sword and cut "Oden" in the face. Oden did not bleed after the cut, causing the Scabbards to realize that it was one of Kanjuro's drawings, and the drawing stabbed Ashura through the chest with one of its swords. Ashura briefly laid on the ground while the Oden drawing clashed with Denjiro and spoke on Kanjuro's behalf, but then the drawing lit some
explosives
under its garment. Ashura immediately took action and tackled the Oden drawing, sending both of them crashing out of the room, and told his comrades to stop Kanjuro from going after Momonosuke. Ashura maintained his grip on the drawing even as it stabbed him, and the explosives then detonated, engulfing both of them in a massive explosion, which killed Ashura.
Legacy
[
]
The explosion which took Ashura's life would inadvertently create a hole in the ceiling of the courtyard of
Onigashima
, which would later help expose
Inuarashi
to the
moonlight
allowing him to use his
Sulong
form
to defeat
Jack
.
Following the success of the
raid on Onigashima
, Kin'emon expressed a desire to build a temple in
Ringo
that would honor Ashura alongside Oden,
Yasuie
, and
Izou
.
