.
Raki
is one of the
Shandia
warriors that fought to take back
Upper Yard
from
Enel
.
Appearance
[
]
Raki is a tall, black-haired woman, with two large bangs parted to either side of her face on the front, and a long and elaborate ponytail on the back. She has dark green eyes, and her lips are apparently covered with pink lipstick. Like all Shandia, she has two small wings on her back. Raki's outfit consists of a light purple cleavage revealing tunic with a darker pattern that exposes her stomach, and light-red pants, reminiscent of the ones worn by Native Americans, that are open on the inside of her legs. She also has matching colored Skate-type
Wavers
she wears into battle. After the end of the Skypiea Arc, she wears a more casual version of her outfit.
Since her childhood, Raki, like many Shandia, has usually stayed barefoot instead of wearing shoes; however, Raki does use them sometimes, such as having on a pair of black flats six years prior to her first appearance. Following the events of the Skypiea Arc, Raki starts wearing shoes on a common basis, using a pair with the outfit she had on at the end of the Skypiea Arc when on a walk with her close friends.
After two years, she has two pieces of hair tied on the top of her head instead of one. She also wears the same sleeveless shirt as Conis with a face with wings on it.
Personality
[
]
Raki is a brave, kind-hearted Shandia woman who likes to make others happy. According to
Wyper
however, she worries over small things (such as
Aisa
's bag of
Vearth
) when she should be focused on the bigger goals (such as winning back their homeland so they never have to fight for just one bag of Vearth ever again).
Relationships

She is good friends with
Kamakiri
and
Aisa
, the latter of the two she would do anything to make happy. She is especially close with Aisa, to the point that their relationship is comparable to an older sister and young sister judging by how they act to each other. Aisa may actually be her cousin since Raki calls Aisa's mother "aunt"
(
おばさん
,
obasan
?
)
, although the term is often used out of respect for the elderly.
Wyper
[
]
Her relationship with Wyper however is a sharp contrast to her other relationships where she appears frightened of his violent nature, while she knows he wants the best for their people she does not like his temperament. She is however one of the few of his warriors to ever try to protest against a decision of his. Despite her differences with him, she remained loyal and supportive of him throughout their battle with Enel and his warriors and cared enough about him to try and warn him about Enel's power. By the end of the fight, she and Aisa both look at Wyper in a different light due to his willingness to sacrifice himself for the cause.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
She uses a rifle as her weapon of choice, and she was seen carrying a small shield on her left arm. Like the other Shandia, she can use
Jet Skis
quite proficiently for in-air transportation. Raki is also quite resistant, as she took
a mighty electricity-based attack
from
Enel
and was still able to stand up later.
History

Past
[
]
Being one of the Shandia, she was born in the sight of war. She, together with her Shandia friends was told about the story of
Kalgara
by the
Chief
.
Sky Island Saga
[
]
Skypiea Arc
[
]
Raki and the Shandians fighting Holy.
She was first seen at a meeting with the other Shandia discussing the incident on
Angel Island
. She told Wyper that the enemy's enemy was their comrade, like
Gan Fall
, whom he had rejected, and in return he told her that she must not join the battle.
Aisa then is asked by Wyper, clinging to Raki in fear, whose voice disappeared. Raki later learned that there are other people besides Gan Fall who are battling. Raki takes Aisa's purse in order to please her by gathering Vearth.
Together with the warriors, they start moving to the
God's Shrine
, where she and the other Shandia confront
Gedatsu
and
Ohm
. The battle lasts long until Kamakiri gets wounded forcing them to retreat.
Outside of the forest, Raki tried to pick up some Vearth but Wyper stopped her. Kamakiri appeared and states that there is no need to get a sack full of Vearth if they take back the island. Wyper then states that the ones who will come with him must know how to leave behind a wounded ally and that their next destination will be God's Shrine. Raki remained by herself to re-gather the Vearth. Later on she runs into Kamakiri lying on the ground, and he pleads with her to try to stop Wyper, and to tell him to not use the
Reject Dial
as it will not work on Enel.
After the conversation with Kamakiri, she started to search for Wyper. She soon reached the upper level of Upper Yard and found Wyper there, then tried to tell Wyper what Kamakiri had told her but Enel suddenly appeared. To no avail, she attempted to shoot at Enel but unfortunately she was struck by Enel's lightning and left unconscious.
After Enel was defeated by
Luffy
, Raki regained consciousness. Although Raki was beaten up, she recovered Aisa's treasured bag of Vearth. When Raki reunited with Aisa, she tried to act tough and annoyed at Raki for making her worry, but eventually burst into tears at the sight she was alright and ran to embrace her.
Raki helped her tribe as well as the other Skypieans recuperate and rebuild following Enel's rampage on Skypiea. She later partied with the
Straw Hat Pirates
and the Skypieans, celebrating their victory. As the crew departed, she gave Aisa a haircut, who was flailing around imitating Luffy, causing her to make Aisa sit still. Raki noticed Aisa's hair was short but nevertheless gave it a trim, and told her it would be more ladylike to grow it out. Tomboyish, Aisa responded with much disapproval and teased Raki for acting ladylike herself, causing them to laugh.
Raki bid farewell to the Straw Hat Pirates as they departed from Skypiea, along with the rest of the island's residents.
