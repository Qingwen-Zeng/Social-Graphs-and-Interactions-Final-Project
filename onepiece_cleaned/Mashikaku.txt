For the anime
non-canon
pirate of Foxy's crew, see
Mashikaku (Non-Canon)
.
Chief Petty Officer Mashikaku
is a subordinate of
Smoker
and
Tashigi
. However, it is unknown if he remained with the two after they transferred to
G-5
as he is not seen with the G-5 Marines.
Appearance
[
]
Mashikaku's facial structure resembles that of a monkey, with bushy brown hair and sideburns, tanned skin, and a square jaw. His signature features are his sideburns that are curved and pointed inwards towards his face and his mouth that is pointed upwards when closed. He wears the standard Marine shirt and cap. In the manga, he wears epaulettes which may serve to differentiate himself in rank as a Chief Petty Officer. In the anime, however, he lacks the epaulettes and so, in terms of uniform, looks no different from a common Marine sailor.
During the
Summit War of Marineford
, he wore a Marine officer's coat over his standard Marine shirt.
Personality
[
]
Mashikaku is somewhat afraid of those with a higher authority than him, as shown when he was afraid of what the higher-ups would say if Smoker disobeyed them, and was also afraid of Smoker when he shouted at him that he did not care.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Mashikaku appears to be somewhat strong as he survived the battle against
Whitebeard
and his allies.
Weapons
[
]
While in Arabasta, Mashikaku carried around a long rifle.
During the Summit War of Marineford, Mashikaku was seen armed with a large sword behind his back.
History
[
]
East Blue Saga
[
]
Loguetown Arc
[
]
While Smoker was stacking rocks and relaxing, Mashikaku barged into the steam room and told Smoker about an emergency involving pirates at the town square. Smoker then gave Mashikaku orders on where each unit should be placed. He then followed
Smoker
through town and when they encountered
Tashigi
, Mashikaku handed her her jacket.
Later, when Smoker decided to head out into the Grand Line to chase after Luffy, he expressed concern over how the higher-ups would react if Smoker were to abandon his post, but Smoker simply told him to report to them that they do not get to order him around.
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
Mashikaku later accompanied Smoker to the
Arabasta Kingdom
. In
Nanohana
, Smoker wondered what the commotion occurring in the
restaurant
in front of them was. Mashikaku then came running towards Smoker and Tashigi from that direction and told them that they would never have guessed
who
showed up in town.
Later, after Smoker encountered Luffy in the restaurant, Mashikaku was seen wiping down his sweat as his captain yelled at Tashigi to chase down the pirate.
After Ace helped Luffy escape, Smoker wondered how they would locate the Straw Hats in such a large country. Afterwards, Tashigi and Mashikaku came running back to Smoker, who then asked them where they were. Mashikaku told him that they were at the opposite side of town, to which Tashigi then tells him to shush. When Smoker started to discuss how he was having a bad feeling about a certain
Warlord
in Arabasta, Mashikaku asked him if he was talking about
Crocodile
.
Later, in
Alubarna
, the Marines encountered
Miss All-Sunday
holding
Nefertari Cobra
hostage. Upon seeing her use her
Treinta Fleur
, Mashikaku immediately stated that he recognized the woman to be
Nico Robin
. He then warned his men that she had had a bounty since she was eight. Tashigi then ordered him to take the Marines to the city square to stop the bombing while she dealt with Nico Robin.
After Crocodile was defeated at the hands of Luffy, Mashikaku wanted to capture the Straw Hats after they had all passed out from exhaustion fighting
Baroque Works
. However, Tashigi forbade him from arresting them.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Amazon Lily Arc
[
]
Smoker, Tashigi, and Mashikaku arrive at Marineford.
Upon the summons to reinforce the headquarters ahead of the execution of
Portgas D. Ace
, Mashikaku walked behind Smoker and Tashigi as they arrived at
Marineford
Marineford Arc
[
]
Before the war began, Mashikaku, Smoker, and Tashigi listened on as
Sengoku
revealed Portgas D. Ace's past to the Marines.
Towards the end of the war, Mashikaku stood alongside Smoker, Tashigi, and
Hina
after
Shanks
arrived at Marineford and Sengoku declared the war to be over.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Mashikaku's infamous "MARNE" cap.
His name is a katakana rendering of
Mashikaku
(
真四角
?
)
, an old-fashioned term for squares that is - fittingly enough - commonly used to describe strongly angular faces.
Being a databook-exclusive fact, his name didn't appear in any licensed English translation of the series until
World Top 100
. Taking advantage of this, some English-speaking fans jokingly named him "Marney the Marine" (stemming from an animation error in
Episode 52
that misspelled his cap label as "MARNE"), something even his
Funimation
voice actor J. Michael Tatum eventually acknowledged.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Whereas Mashikaku made his manga debut after the
Buggy and Alvida Alliance
were causing trouble in the town square, his anime debut was, instead, when he received the new bounty of
Monkey D. Luffy
and ran to report to Smoker of it.
Furthermore, he was not shown with epaulettes in his anime debut.
He was also replaced by a random Marine during Smoker's arrival at Marineford.
