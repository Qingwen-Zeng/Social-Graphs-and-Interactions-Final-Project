History

Making their Mark
[
]
Prior to joining the
Spade Pirates
, Skull developed a fascination for pirates, stowing away on numerous ships and amassing a collection of pirate goods and skull-shaped accessories. When he met
Portgas D. Ace
, the pirate captain recognized Skull's superb knowledge, inviting him to join the Spade Pirates and travel with Ace as he made a name for himself.
Skull helped fight off a group of
bounty hunters
, jamming one's skull-designed gun and stealing it. When
Marine
Ensign
Isuka
infiltrated the crew's ship, he identified her and surrounded the Ensign alongside his crewmates. However, she easily fended them off. After the confrontation, the crew reached
Sabaody Archipelago
. While they waited for their ship to be
coated
, Skull and his crewmates explored the island and secretly read
Deuce
's adventure diary. Unlike the rest of his crewmates, he did not laugh at Deuce's poor writing skills.
When Ace went off to explore, Skull warned him not to cause trouble with the
World Nobles
, Marines, or bounty hunters.
After spending time in Sabaody, Skull and the Spade Pirates descended to
Fish-Man Island
to begin their journey in the
New World
.
At one point, the Spade Pirates were shipwrecked in
Wano Country
. The people from
Amigasa Village
were starving to death, so they tied the entire crew and stole all their food. The crew watched the villagers finish their meal and then broke out. Instead of attacking, Ace asked the villagers where he could get them dessert. They stayed in Amigasa Village for a few weeks and became good friends with
Tama
. They also went to
Onigashima
to liberate the abducted children from the
Beasts Pirates
. They never encountered
Kaidou
and his top subordinates because they were away on an expedition. After Ace did so much damage to Kaidou's castle, they rescued the children and met
Yamato
, with whom Ace had a brief scuffle.
Encountering Whitebeard
[

The Spade Pirates Prepare to Fight Whitebeard.

Whitebeard Pirates
like their captain.

shocked with Whitebeard's decision.

Spade Pirates
visited Ace and Whitebeard's graves, late enough to see the cups left by
