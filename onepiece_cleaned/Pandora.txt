As a sun homie, Pandora is capable of flight. It also provides fire and warmth, and can light cigarettes.
Due to being made from the soul of the

History
[
]
Pandora coming to life.
61 years before the start of the series, Pandora was created when
Carmel
placed a portion of her soul into a large fire in
Elbaph
. The citizens who witnessed this believed Carmel summoned the sun god and considered it a miracle. It then accompanied Carmel, and was present when she met with
Cipher Pol
. Carmel later died, so it is unknown what happened to Pandora after that.
