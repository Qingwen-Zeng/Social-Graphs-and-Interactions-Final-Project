The
Pacifista
are
human weapons
(
人間兵器
,
ningen-heiki
?
)
developed by
Marine
head scientist,
Dr. Vegapunk
. The originals are
clones
of the former
Warlord
Bartholomew Kuma
, who were cybernetically enhanced into cyborgs
Kuma himself was the cyborg prototype for the project. As stated by
Sentomaru
, the funds required for the construction of just one Pacifista are roughly equal to that of a Marine-issued battleship.
Sentomaru noted that after the timeskip, the current Pacifista models were
prototypes
(
試作品
,
purototaipu
?
)
from two years ago, meaning that the Pacifista project has been updated and modified.
The new models are dubbed "
Mark III
"
(
マーク
Ⅲ
,
Māku Surī
?
, VIZ.: Mk. III)
and stationed on the island of Egghead. Furthermore, a small group of elite Pacifista, dubbed
Seraphim
, eventually reached completion and were used in the hunt for the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
after the group's abolishment.
Appearance
[
]
All the original Pacifista replicas seen were made identical in appearance to Bartholomew Kuma due to their clone statuses, even in his uncommon body proportion. The only distinguishing features between them and the genuine article are the lack of a Bible and Kuma's
Nikyu Nikyu no Mi
palm pads, though the latter is not initially apparent as they all wear similar gloves. Each Pacifista is considered to be a copy of Kuma, except for the original one who was gradually converted into a Pacifista. The Pacifista have the voice of Kuma, furthering their genuine replication to him. They are also under complete control of the World Government.
Their appearances are so convincing that
pirates
unfamiliar with the genuine article believe they are the real Kuma. The
Straw Hat Pirates
, having previously fought Kuma, were able to tell the difference eventually. Likewise,
X Drake
, a former
rear admiral
familiar with the project, was aware of its nature. Some
New World
pirates were aware of Vegapunk's experiments, and that he sent several prototypes to handle incidents in the past, but were surprised that they were all modeled after Kuma.
All Pacifista are labeled by the letters "PX", then a hyphen and a number, presumably indicating the order in which they were constructed. This label is printed on the right side of their necks. There appears to be around twenty of them in service as of the
Summit War of Marineford
, though it is unknown how many have been destroyed and built since then.
On Egghead, there is at least one Pacifista unit that wears police uniform and tactical armor instead of Kuma's outfit. Due to the sleeves being disconnected, parts of the cybernetics around the shoulder areas are exposed. This unit also wears sunglasses.
The upgraded Pacifista Mark III, which appear on Egghead under Sentomaru's command, is morphologically identical to a standard Pacifista modeled after Bartholomew Kuma, but wears differing clothes. This model is outfitted with a double-breasted jumpsuit bearing each individual's serial number on the chest, a hard combat helmet, aviator sunglasses, a reinforced metal collar, and gloves with palm-holes to dispense resin.

Details

Behavior
[
]
Pacifista are straightforward and robotic in the execution of their duties. They can identify pirates with active bounties and will immediately attack. Pacifista will normally avoid attacking allies, such as a Warlord,
though this directive can be ignored if they are ordered to attack. If they are not ordered to, they will not even strike when they are attacked themselves, as seen when Hancock (a Warlord) destroyed several Pacifista in a row.
A Pacifista authority chip.
Pacifista follow a strict authority hierarchy, and are programmed to follow the commands of a select few indviduals directly. Others must be in possession of an
authority chip
(
威権チップ
,
iken chippu
?
)
in order to command the Pacifista. The commands of a lower-ranked authority can be overruled by a higher-ranked one, although the individual must be there in person to do so, as commands given through
Den Den Mushi
do not work. If two people in the hierarchy have the same authority level, the original order cannot be overridden by the other person; it can only be overwritten by the command of someone higher on the ladder of authority.
The orders are still carried out if the person who dictated them becomes incapacitated.
The authority hierarchy for Pacifista is the following:
Jewelry Bonney
(for all Kuma-formed Pacifista)
Five Elders
Vegapunk
(
Stella + Satellites
)
Sentomaru
Authority chip owners (
Kaku
,
Rob Lucci
,
Stussy
,
Kizaru
,
Egghead Incident
Marines
)
To the public at large, the Five Elders are at the top of the Pacifista command hierarchy. However, unbeknownst to anyone but Vegapunk himself, he programmed one authority even greater than the Five Elders into all the Kuma-formed Pacifista;
Jewelry Bonney
, as he could not live with himself should Bonney be killed by machines sharing her father's appearance. When Bonney was told of this and she gave the command that overrode that of
Saint Saturn
, the Elder became livid when he deduced Vegapunk's betrayal.
Pacifista have the ability to speak, but rarely do so. Usually, they will speak to announce the presence of a pirate with an active bounty (
Trafalgar Law
,
Scratchmen Apoo
, and
Monkey D. Luffy
have all been referred to this way). During the Marineford War, one relayed orders to stand down when Boa Hancock moved into its path of fire. It then ordered her to step aside.
Sentomaru was also able to order one to speak, having it identify
a pirate
to an assembled crowd.
While they mostly mimic Kuma's stoic personality, some have been shown to exhibit slight emotion via facial expression, usually surprise or pain.
While Bartholomew Kuma was loyal to the
World Government
, he still had the free will to choose whether or not to obey orders. After the modifications were completed, he became practically as emotionless as any Pacifista. However, as his last act as a free man, Kuma had a special mission programmed into him by Vegapunk, instructing him to protect the
Thousand Sunny
until it was reclaimed by the Straw Hats.
Following this, he presumably behaves as the others do. Despite losing his free will, this did not erase Kuma’s instinct to protect his daughter, Jewelry Bonney.
While they ordinarily attack with precision, a damaged Pacifista can potentially go berserk and fire wildly in every direction. As seen in the fight between PX-4 and the Straw Hats, a Pacifista can panic if they suffer enough damage and will attack randomly, without aiming, to defeat the threat.
This may be a malfunction or an emergency setting.
Overall Strength
[
]
Kuma's modifications enhancing his strength.
As the manufactured clones of Bartholomew Kuma, the Pacifista have not only inherited Kuma's appearance, but possess his great physical strength as well, which could be attributed to both his heritage as a member of the near extinct
Buccaneers
race and their overall modifications as cyborgs. The Pacifista are cyborgs, similar to
Franky
of the
Straw Hat Pirates
.
They are composed of a metal even stronger than steel, as demonstrated when Zoro's attempt to attack the partially-converted Kuma only resulted in a slight gash in the metal, whereas ordinary steel would have been cleaved in two. Metal weapons used by weaker opponents either shatter into pieces or fail to penetrate their hard outer shell.
After striking PX-0 once, Sanji (using
Diable Jambe
) was forced to note that if the kick had been any harder he would have broken his leg in two (this technique easily broke through
Jabra
's
Tekkai
).
However, as Franky pointed out, despite all their strengths, they are still human beneath and are capable of bleeding.
Due to their height and build, the Pacifista have incredible physical strength and can lift up fully grown human beings with a single hand.
Pacifista can identify wanted pirates on sight using an electronic scope, thus the red glow in the pupils of the eye lenses, which works at a significant distance. It not only lets them know the name of the person in front of them but also their bounty.
Their recognition ability is also extremely good, as one was able to identify Luffy while obscured by smoke, in addition to seeing through his heavy clothing and joke mustache disguise;
it also distinguished the impostor Luffy's true identity.
The real Kuma was also able to identify Franky after the two-year timeskip despite the extensive modifications that the fellow cyborg underwent.
However, if the targets go through a sufficient change in age, it will be unable to recognize them.
A Pacifista mouth beam.
The Pacifista's main mode of combat is firing
laser
beams from their mouth and hands which are based on
Kizaru
's
light-based
Devil Fruit
.
These beams possess tremendous piercing power, allowing them to penetrate the tough hide of a
transformed
Ancient Zoan
user
,
and can also cause massive explosions, inflicting severe to fatalistic damage to targets and the environment. The Pacifista can also run slightly faster than most people and jump quite high, despite their size, although they are still slower than Kuma himself (this being ironic as Kuma himself never runs).
Robin forces PX-4 to swallow its own laser, causing it to go berserk.
As cyborgs, the Pacifista are capable of taking staggering amounts of damage without being disabled. For example, despite being set on fire by Sanji, PX-1 continued operating.
PX-4 also continued operating despite direct damage to its internal systems. The laser beams from their mouth can cause a severe backlash if the mouth is forced shut before firing, which causes the photon energy to explode inside the cyborg's body, damaging the constitutional framework although even this would not be enough to force a shutdown. Only significant and irreversible trauma seems capable of stopping them, such as breaking their necks or cleaving them in two.
They may explode if sufficiently damaged.
They are composed of a nonmagnetic metal, as they were not affected by the power of the
Jiki Jiki no Mi
.
As pointed out by the Straw Hats, the lack of the Devil Fruit ability does not make their defenses or built-in weaponry any weaker than those of the original. In fact, it took the entire pre-timeskip Straw Hat Crew just to bring down one of the replicas—an effort which left them winded and exhausted (though Zoro had previously been wounded from the fight on Thriller Bark).
However, Kuma's Devil Fruit still separates him from the other Pacifista in terms of overall capabilities; Kuma himself easily dealt with PX-1 by "teleporting" him away.
According to Sentomaru, the versions used against the Straw Hats were the prototypes, so they are inferior to the newer models, the
Seraphim
.
After the timeskip, the prototype Pacifista appear to be considerably less formidable due to the newfound strength of the Straw Hats, as Luffy, Zoro and Sanji have become powerful enough to take down the cyborgs by themselves with a single
punch
,
slash
, and
kick
, respectively.
However, they were still capable of defeating the likes of
Lip Doughty
, a
pirate captain
with a bounty of
88,000,000, with relative ease.
Mark III
[
]
PX-III 041 using a Bubble Shield.
The Mark III model displays the ability to weaponize what appears to be
Yarukiman
-type resin in battle, which it dispenses from a hole in its palm and is referred to as a
Bubble Shield
(
バブルシールド
,
Baburu Shīrudo
?
)
. While the resin applied to ships at the
Sabaody Archipelago
is already extremely durable, used to protect against the crushing ambient pressure of the deep sea, the kind employed by the Mark III is resilient to more focused force as well, as it deflected a bazooka shot. How this resin maintains its constitution outside of Sabaody's unique atmosphere – whether it be as a function of Egghead's artificially curated climate or by some other means – is unknown.
These Pacifista answer verbally to
Sentomaru
and appear to sleep in pods in the Fabriophase when not in use.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
The Pacifista Project.
While
Dr. Vegapunk
had the idea for a
cloned
-
cyborg
army for a while, it was only approximately four years before the current storyline that the project truly started, when he met the former
revolutionary
and then pirate,
Bartholomew Kuma
. Kuma, who at the time was desperately looking for someone to cure his adoptive daughter,
Jewelry Bonney
's seemingly incurable
Sapphire Scales
disease, was finally led to Vegapunk. After learning that Kuma was the last of the
Buccaneer race
, their initial deal was for Kuma to hand over some blood samples so that Vegapunk could clone him for his cyborg army project, dubbed "Pacifista" due to a comment from Kuma saying he's a pacifist. However, one of the
Five Elders
,
Jaygarcia Saturn
, having wiretapped this conversation, came up with his own conditions, those being that firstly, Kuma would join the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
; secondly, that Kuma himself would also become a cyborg; and finally, Kuma would abandon his mind and free will to become a biological robot. Originally, Vegapunk vehemently opposed this last condition due to how inhumane it was, but Kuma himself agreed, seeing this as the only way to save Bonney. Bonney herself was unknowingly made a hostage, being under constant supervision and surveillance from the Marines and
Cipher Pol
, both at the lab and at her home in
Sorbet Kingdom
. Throughout the project, Vegapunk repeatedly tried to negotiate with Saturn regarding the killing of Kuma's mind, offering the alternative of a device that can suppress his personality with another's, that can be turned off and on, but Saturn rejected all of Vegapunk's suggestions, insisting that nothing short of the complete destruction of Kuma's personality would satisfy him. In addition, Saturn instructed Vegapunk to install a self-destruct system into Kuma, which Vegapunk was very reluctant to agree after his attempts to argue failed.
Over time, the project began converting Kuma part by part, starting with his hands, then legs, though he retained his free will so long as his brain remained unmodified. Vegapunk also created many Pacifista units, all of whom had the same appearance as the real Kuma and sent these prototypes to deal with incidents around the world. Few people outside the Marines actually knew about these prototypes, thinking they were the real Kuma, but several people did hear rumors about them, mostly pirates in the
New World
.
Thriller Bark Saga
[
]
Thriller Bark Arc
[
]
After Kuma witnessed
Gecko Moria
get beaten by
Monkey D. Luffy
, Kuma then reported this to the World Government. Fearful that the rumors of Moria's defeat would cause another global uproar like with
Crocodile
, they ordered Kuma to kill all witnesses on
Thriller Bark
including the
Straw Hat Pirates
. Accepting the order, he launched an attack on some of the members of the
Thriller Bark Victim's Association
before shifting his attention to
Roronoa Zoro
.
Kuma weakened Zoro and used
his Devil Fruit ability
to take down
Franky
while
Sanji
nearly crippled himself striking the Warlord. He gave them an ultimatum: Let him kill Luffy, and he would let them all live. When they refused him, Kuma calmly decimated the entire island.
Though this did not succeed in killing the Straw Hats, it rendered all of them incapacitated. Just when he was about to finish off an unconscious Luffy, Zoro, in a desperate move, struck him with
One Sword Style Iai: Shishi Sonson
in an effort to kill him by cutting him in two but was only able to slightly damage Kuma's left shoulder. The wound on Kuma's shoulder revealed that he was a cyborg. He then revealed that he was different from Cyborg Franky. Kuma was an incomplete human weapon created by the World Government and Dr. Vegapunk, known as a Pacifista. Zoro offered to trade his life for Luffy's, seeing no other way. Kuma agreed and at that moment, Sanji decided to trade his life for Zoro's instead. Zoro promptly knocked him out, feeling necessary to sacrifice his own life rather than Sanji's. Kuma stated that he would not harm Luffy, as his "honor would be at stake", in exchange for Zoro experiencing the pain Luffy endured throughout his fight against Moria. Kuma proceeded to literally extract Luffy's pain, and directed it to Zoro, which almost killed him. Kuma then teleported to the entrance to the ship, where he mused about
Monkey D. Dragon
having a good son with a loyal crew.
Summit War Saga

Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[

Kid, Killer and Law vs. a Pacifista.
Soon after, many other Pacifista units made their way to the
Sabaody Archipelago
, where one of them was able to track down and find the escaping
Kid Pirates
, who were running from other Marine chaos due to the actions partially caused by captain
Eustass Kid
.
The
Heart Pirates
soon joined in the battle to escape the island.
Also, another Pacifista appeared in front of
Urouge
and a third in front of the Straw Hats. During the recent battle, they demonstrated none of the
Devil Fruit
abilities the original Bartholomew Kuma had previously, firing lasers from his hands instead of using his
Devil Fruit
, and failing to counter Franky's
Coup de Vent
, despite his previous fighting style being heavily focused on reflecting air. It was
X Drake
who revealed that these many Kumas are in fact Pacifistas, into which Vegapunk has copied Kuma's appearance and
Admiral
Kizaru's
Pika Pika no Mi
powers.
Kuma himself arrived and, using his repelling ability, separated the entire Straw Hat crew, sending them and PX-1 to different locations all over the
world
.
Marineford Arc
[
]
Sentomaru arrives with an army of Pacifistas.
During the
Summit War of Marineford
between the
Whitebeard Pirates
and the
World Government
, at Kuma's battle with
Emporio Ivankov
,
Donquixote Doflamingo
revealed that Kuma had been fully converted into a Pacifista, PX-0, losing his free will in the process. Later, near the final stretches of the war, where
Portgas D. Ace
's execution would occur earlier than planned,
Sentomaru
appeared from the bay of
Marineford
, backed up with an army of at least twenty Pacifistas.
Following
Sengoku
's plan, Sentomaru ordered the Pacifista to surround the
New World
pirates in a circular formation, and eliminate them while they were trapped, all the while killing anyone who tried to leave the circle. The pirates were outmatched by the Pacifista's superior firepower and armor, and
Whitebeard
noted that they were not above sacrificing allies to achieve results.
However, Sengoku ordered them to avoid attacking the pirates of Whitebeard, as a way to create doubt and manipulate Whitebeard's allies to attack Whitebeard on the belief he was sacrificing them to save Ace.
The Pacifistas attack the New World Pirates.
During the battle at the plaza, they destroyed many pirate and marine ships alike to ensure the fatalities of the enemy. The desperate New World Pirates attempted to damage some with rocket launchers and maces, but they proved ineffective against their strong bodies. Eventually some of the New World pirates managed to take down a Pacifista by puncturing its neck with a lance and a combination of firepower to its body.
Later, when some Pacifista tried to attack
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Boa Hancock
interrupted them and then crushed and petrified several of them until she was confronted by Sentomaru.
When he confronted her, demanding to know why she was attacking the Pacifista, she simply replied that love was like a hurricane.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
The Pacifistas pursuing the Whitebeard Pirates.
The Pacifista crushed the New World Pirates while Hancock continued to stall their efforts to target Luffy by jumping in their way. She destroyed more Pacifistas under the excuse they may have hit Sengoku by accident. When the war reached its peak, they stood back, along with the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, witnessing the death of
Whitebeard
.
Concludes non-canon section.
Upon the
Blackbeard Pirates
declaring war on
Marineford
, they moved forward attacking the
Whitebeard Pirates
attempting to escape moving past the fissure gaps towards the ships.
When Sengoku called off the war, they stood down, allowing the remaining Whitebeard Pirates to escape.
Post-War Arc
[
]
Doflamingo and a squad of Pacifistas attempting to kill Moria.
Shortly after the end of the war, innumerable Pacifista units, accompanied by
Donquixote Doflamingo
, quickly surrounded
Gecko Moria
behind the street corner of Marineford and began firing off their lasers at him. Under an order higher than
Sengoku
's, it was deemed that Moria was too weak to continue as a
Warlord
and that it would be better off if he was eliminated and made it look like he died in the war instead.
However, before they could deal a death blow to Moria, he disappeared with what Doflamingo speculated to be his
Kage Kage no Mi
powers. Regardless, the wounds that the Pacifista inflicted was deep, and Doflamingo said that Moria was doomed to die no matter what—a claim that was later disproven, as Moria was rumored to be seen in the New World.

Return to Sabaody Arc
[

Pacifistas attacking the recruits of the Fake Straw Hat Crew.
When news arrives that the
Straw Hat Pirates
, who are actually
impostors
, had reappeared on the
Sabaody Archipelago
,
Sentomaru
left with PX-5 and PX-7 to capture them, believing that the Straw Hats would be too strong to warrant any less. Because of their public debut during the war, more people were aware of the Pacifistas' existences.
This proved to be a wise precaution as the real Luffy was present on the island. Upon PX-5 identifying the
fake Luffy
's identity and then the real Luffy, it proceeded to fire a laser beam at Luffy's head, which was easily dodged and prompting Luffy to claim it was too slow. It was then defeated with a
Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol
that was enhanced with
Armament Haki
, and due to extreme damage, it exploded. PX-7 was soon destroyed by Zoro and Sanji upon their reunion, which also exploded from extreme damage.
Sentomaru later commented that they were the same prototypes that attacked the
Super Rookies
two years ago.

A Pacifista vs. General Franky.
During the events of the

, the Marines were informed of the secret event taking place and an army of Pacifistas was sent to ambush the pirates at the port to destroy their ships. Franky piloted his
General Franky
armor and clashed with one of them on equal footing. When
Douglas Bullet
used his
devil fruit ability
to wall off the island, the Pacifistas were helpless against his overwhelming power. After Luffy defeated Bullet, they were spared the fate of the impending Buster Call and returned to their ships, taking minimal damage from the event.

Egghead Arc
[
]
When Luffy,
Tony Tony Chopper
,
Jinbe
and
Jewelry Bonney
took food and clothing from the various machines in
Egghead
without paying, a Pacifista in a police uniform came to attack them for their crimes. Luffy tried to defend himself by attacking the unit, but as Kuma was her father, whom she couldn't bear see being hurt, Bonney stopped him despite it not really being Kuma.
When Bonney changed the group's ages, the Pacifista was unable to recognize them and ceased its pursuit.
The Pacifista enacting Atlas' order and begin to eradicate all Marines.
Later on, during
Cipher Pol
's incursion onto Egghead,
Sentomaru
deployed 50 Mark III units, and ordered them to ensure that Dr. Vegapunk made it safely off the island with the Straw Hat Pirates at any cost. One of these units was seen fighting some Cipher Pol agents, repelling bazooka fire with a bubble shield before taking the agents into custody.
The same Pacifista-units were later stationed by Sentomaru alongside the coast to fend off the invading
Marines
, receiving their direct order shortly after Sentomaru engaged
Kizaru
in a battle,
fighting and engaging several
Vice Admirals
in the ongoing battle before they received a new order by Kizaru who defeated Sentomaru and instead were ordered to support the Marines and attack the
Sea Beast Weapons
off the coast of Egghead,
being successful in doing so.
Their order was later overwritten once more by
Atlas
, who descended towards the Fabriophase alongside Vegapunk, now ordering them to attack the invading Marines on Egghead.
The Pacifista once again turn on the Marines, on Bonney's order.
However, when
Jaygarcia Saturn
appeared on the island, he used his supreme authority to make the Pacifistas stand down.
Later, everyone was shocked when the original Pacifista, Bartholomew Kuma, appeared and attacked Saturn to defend his daughter.
He then made the other Pacifista units surround and focus their attacks on Bonney, Kuma, Franky, Sanji and Atlas.
It was at this point though that Atlas revealed to Bonney that she possessed the highest authority over all Kuma-formed Pacifista, causing the girl to command the Pacifistas to help them escape the island, which leads to the units to once again attack the Marines.
A Pacifista is frozen by Nusjuro.
While the Pacifista continued to take on the Marines, the remaining Five Elders touched down on Egghead. They immediately got to work at stopping the Pacifista, with Saint
Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro
wielding his sword and using it to freeze their vital neural systems, temporarily paralyzing them. He continued to run along the coastline, incapacitating as many Pacifista as he could see, and giving the Marines an opportunity to fight back once again.

Translation and Dub Issues

"Pacifista" is the Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Czech, Catalan, and Galician word for "Pacifist". In this case, the name is ironic since the Pacifista are weapons used for war.
In the European version of "One Piece Unlimited Cruise 2", they are referred to as "Combat Weapon" in the Treasure Map menu, but have been referenced as "PX-1" by the Straw Hat crew.
