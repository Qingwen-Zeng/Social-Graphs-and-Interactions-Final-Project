Nefertari Titi
was the
queen
of
Arabasta
,
Nefertari Cobra
's wife, and
Nefertari Vivi
's mother.
Appearance
Twenty-four years before the start of the series, Titi bore a striking resemblance to her daughter's current appearance; they both have flowing blue hair (though Vivi ties hers in a ponytail at times), slender bodies, and dark eyes. In fact, Vivi is supposedly the spitting image of her mother, so much so that when she was dressed up for her coming of age ceremony, Cobra almost mistook Vivi for her late mother.
Titi was shown to be wearing a purple shirt, a white robe with a pink border over it, a golden neckband, and a gold bracelet.
In a photograph taken sometime after Vivi's birth, Titi had her hair tied in a bun. She also wore earrings and normal regal attire.
Abilities and Powers

queen
of Arabasta, Titi possessed authority over the entire kingdom.
