Caribou's Kehihihihi in the New World
[
]
After
Caribou
washed up on Baburu's homeland, she nursed him back to health, eventually falling asleep while sitting next to him.
When he woke up, he stole her jewelry and food, but she woke up and gave him a meat pie for the road.
As he tried to leave, he was accosted by revolutionaries believing him to be
Gaburu
, but Baburu drove them off
and saw Caribou to the port.
After witnessing the conditions of
Kaidou
's weapons factory and the budding revolution on the island,
Caribou returned to Baburu's house, which he found in flames with her inside.
Similarly mistaking him for Gaburu, her grandson,
Baburu urged Caribou to run away and not fight anymore;
however, she was interrupted by
Scotch
attacking her house, blasting her backwards.
With Caribou running back to the port, Baburu was taken by Scotch and used as an example of what happens to those who try to revolt.
However, Caribou returned with the
Caribou Pirates
in tow, pretending to the revolutionary Gaburu and battling against Scotch's forces, defeating them and destroying the factory.
Shortly after,
X Drake
arrived on the island, quickly dispatching Caribou and dragging him away as Baburu watched,
though Caribou convinced Drake to spare her and the other civilians.
She gave him one last meat pie for the journey
and watched as Drake's ship left.
Sometime later, she thanked Caribou for his defense of the island as she knelt in front of Gaburu's grave, having known they were different people the entire time.
