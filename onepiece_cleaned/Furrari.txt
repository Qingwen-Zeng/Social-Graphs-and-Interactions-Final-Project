He wears a dark suit with a light dress shirt underneath, some jewelry around his neck and a sun-shaped brooch on the left side of his suit's collar. He also wears a fedora-like hat with its crown resembling a small, square-shaped golden castle. He is frequently seem smoking a cigar.
Personality
[
]
Like many, Furrari admired the
mermaid princess
because of her beauty, and was aware that other kings like
Jeep
would attempt to court her with their children, trying to involve his
own son
in a marriage pitch as well. He can be easily offended as he got angry when Shirahoshi rejected her suitors.
Furrari appears to be fairly argumentative and confrontational, as he and
Ramen
of
Kano Country
were shown bickering.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Furrari is the king of a nation affiliated with the
World Government
and one of the few allowed to attend the Levely, which grants him some authority over matters concerning the world.
According to
Monkey D. Garp
's description of the Levely to
Neptune
, Furrari's nation appears to be relatively small and subservient to the whims of greater ones, like
Chap
's.
History

Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Levely Arc
[
]
At the Socializing Plaza, Furrari noticed
Jeep
trying to set up his son
Wheel
with
Shirahoshi
, interrupting them both in order to introduce his own son as well. However, the latter rejected all her suitors, causing Jeep to express that she had made them lose face, leading to
Fukaboshi
hurriedly trying to calm the royals to avoid further hurting them and starting an incident.
When the Levely began, he was seated next to
Mororon
.
Wano Country Saga

Wano Country Arc
[
]
While Garp was recounting the events of the Levely to Neptune, it appears that Furrari entered an argument with Ramen at some point, with Chap and
Sauce
fueling the conflict from the background.
Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
The anime slightly modified the scene where Garp recounts the events of the Levely. During Furrari's verbal confrontation with Ramen,
Chap
was briefly shown silently pressuring him from the sidelines.
