When the
Beasts Pirates
, led by

Zou
in search of

, Concelot and the rest of the
Inuarashi Musketeer Squad
fought against them. When dusk fell, Concelot and the Musketeers fell back to allow
Nekomamushi
and the
Guardians
to take over the battle.
The battle against the Beast Pirates lasted for five days. On the fifth day of the battle, Jack lost his patience and unleashed
Caesar Clown
's
Koro
gas, which left the
Mink Tribe
poisoned and drastically weakened. Concelot,
Shishilian

Zou Arc
[

When
Bariete
rang the bell and spoke of the arrival of samurai, Concelot and the rest of the minks rushed to Kurau City. When
Kin'emon
and
Kanjuro
revealed themselves, Concelot and the minks welcomed them and revealed that
Raizo
was on
Zou
before standing proudly at having kept his presence a secret.
Kin'emon showed Concelot and the other minks the crest of the
Kouzuki Family
on his back to confirm his allegiance. When Inuarashi and
Nekomamushi
reluctantly called a truce for the sake of
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, whom they recognized as their lord, Concelot and the rest of the minks were overjoyed.
When Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, the samurai, and the pirates returned from the Whale Tree with Raizo, Zou began shaking as
Zunesha
started crying out, throwing Concelot and the others into a state of panic.
Jack had returned and was attempting to destroy Zou by killing Zunesha, who retaliated on Momonosuke's command and sank Jack's fleet with one blow, calming down Concelot and the others in the process.
Later on,
Shishilian
requested to accompany the Sanji Retrieval Team to
Whole Cake Island
along with
Giovanni
and Concelot, but was told to stay behind on Zou by Nekomamushi.

Nico Robin

in

two days before the raid on

On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Concelot joined the
Straw Hat Pirates
on the
Thousand Sunny
as they entered the battle with the Beasts Pirates.
After disembarking on Onigashima, Concelot joined the group led by Kin'emon. The group reached the Pleasure Hall owned by
Black Maria
. As they traversed through the area, they quickly hid themselves underwater when
Big Mom
looked outside from one of the nearby buildings.
As Big Mom chased after the
Brachio Tank V
, Kin'emon led the rest of the force onward.
After the all-out war began, the minks waiting on the roof of the
Skull Dome
until
Kaidou
arrived there with the
Scabbards
. When Jack and a platoon arrived, the minks then transformed into their
Sulong
forms
and began decimating Jack's forces.
After a fierce battle, most of the minks were wounded from their fight against Jack.
As Kaidou created wind scythes with a roar, the wounded minks fled from the roof.
Concelot and his fellow minks later went to the fifth floor of the castle and cleared a path for
Monkey D. Luffy
, enabling him to reach the roof unhindered.
A week after the defeat of the
alliance
victory, Concelot joined the other minks, when Inuarashi and Nekomamushi gave Carrot the title of ruler of the Mokomo Dukedom, where they all supported her, since she possessed
