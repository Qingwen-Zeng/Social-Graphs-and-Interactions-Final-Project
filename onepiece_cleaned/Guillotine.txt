Final Saga
[

Egghead Arc
[
]
When the
World Government
had ordered to eliminate
Vegapunk
, Guillotine, alongside
Jaygarcia Saturn
,
Kizaru
, and eight other
Vice Admirals
, led a Marine fleet to besiege the island of
Egghead
.
After the Marines made landfall, the Vice Admirals witnessed
Jewelry Bonney
stab Saturn and attempted to open fire on her, but Saturn told them all to back down, saying that he would have dodged if he was afraid of her sword.
Saturn then ordered a
Buster Call
on Egghead, prompting the Marines to evacuate.
During the attack, the
Pacifista
under Bonney's command were attacking the ships. While the Marines were considering to stop firing at the Pacifista, Guillotine said they could not as Vegapunk himself allowed the Pacifista to be under a pirate's control.
He,
Red King
and
Pomsky
later confronted Bonney's group before they could reach the
Giant Warrior Pirates
' ship in an attempt to eliminate her.
Franky took out Red King, while Bonney turned Pomsky into a child and kicked him, which Guillotine felt horrified by.
Their efforts ended up failing, as Bonney's group managed to board the ship.
