When
Portgas D. Ace
was to be executed at
Marineford
, Kechatch and his crew joined forces with the
Whitebeard Pirates
in order to save him from execution. While the
Marines
were bracing for the arrival of the pirates, Kechatch and the allied fleet of the 43 subordinate captains caught them by surprise when the fleet suddenly appeared out of nowhere just off the shores of Marineford.
A few moments later, the pirates received the orders to attack and, immediately following the vice admirals' entrance into battle, Kechatch charged into battle on his beast alongside several of the other subordinate captains.
At the end of the war, the
Red Hair Pirates
arrived and Sengoku allowed the surviving pirates to leave.
