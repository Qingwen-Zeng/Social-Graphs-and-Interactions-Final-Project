is one of the five
Jailer Beasts
of
Impel Down
. He is an
"awakened" Zoan
Devil Fruit
user that ate a fruit that allows him to turn into a koala.
Due to his actions, he can be considered a supporting antagonist of the
Impel Down Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
In his Zoan form, Minokoala is a large yellow koala in pants. He has cutesy eyes, large lips, and a runny nose like every other Jailer Beast. He wields three spiked knuckles in his hands. Carried alongside his side, is a bag full of eucalyptus leaves that he eats. The Minokoala wears pants having the former Japanese Imperial Navy flag represented on them.
Personality
[
]
Minokoala is described as being hawkish. He apparently enjoys eating Eucalyptus and bullying
Minorhinoceros
. Aside from this, he is also violent and bloodthirsty like the other Jailer Beasts. He acknowledges Sadi's superiority in battle, even fearing her when she got angry over his failure. Since Minokoala is a koala, he likes to eat eucalyptus leaves, which is why he always has a bag with them on his waist.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As one of the Jailer Beasts of Impel Down under
Sadi
, Minokoala is in charge of torturing and maintaining various prisoners.
Weapons
[
]
He fights with spiked brass knuckles on each hand.
Devil Fruit
[
]
He has eaten an as-of-yet unnamed
Zoan
type Devil Fruit that allows him to become a koala. Because he is an "
Awakened Zoan
", he is able to recover rapidly even after suffering high amounts of damage.
His Awakening however would ultimately be a failure, turning Minokoala into near feral beast.
