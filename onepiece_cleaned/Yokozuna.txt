History
[

Past
[
]
At least 24 years ago, Yokozuna had been the pet of
Tom's Workers
and was close with them. Yokozuna was often present for the construction of the
Puffing Tom
that spanned for the next ten years.
However 10 years ago, Tom and
Franky
were framed by
CP5
agent's using the warships that Franky had built to fight the Sea Kings to attack
Water 7
.
As a result, Tom was sentenced to death and Yokozuna and Tom's workers were brought to trial. Franky, however attacked the
agent
responsible and later stood in front of the Puffing Tom, trying to rescue Tom, all of which Yokozuna witnessed.
When Franky was run over by the train, Yokozuna became traumatized by the event and would always swim through the waters around Water 7, getting in the way of the Sea Train to try and stop it for many years. This habit was sprung by Yokozuna wanting to become stronger so he will not lose any more of his loved ones.

Water 7 Arc
[
]
When Yokozuna was first introduced he was performing this very routine when Zoro spotted him from the
Going Merry
; after informing the rest of his crew about the giant frog swimming in a freestyle manner not unlike a human, Luffy immediately decided to slightly change course (they were headed to the next island, which happened to be Water 7) to capture the giant frog so his crew could have a nice barbecue meal.
This habit also caused Yokozuna to try and stop the
Rocketman
while the
Straw Hat Pirates
,
Galley-La
foremen, and the
Franky Family
were traveling towards
Enies Lobby
, but because
Old Lady Kokoro
, an old friend of his, was present to tell him of
Franky
's plight, he ends up helping them in their attempt to get Franky and
Nico Robin
back.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
While on Enies Lobby, his defensive style forged through years of facing down Puffing Tom put him in charge of preventing any government agents from getting into the courthouse once the Straw Hats and Co. had breached it, and does this very well, even handling multiple attacks from the powerful
Jurors
when they arrive. After he becomes exhausted and cannot stand up to the them anymore, he is saved by the giants
Oimo
and
Kashii
who decide to help him guard the courthouse and acknowledge his prowess. Yokozuna later boarded the Sea Train with the Franky Family, the Galley-La foremen, and the giants and has since returned to Water 7.
