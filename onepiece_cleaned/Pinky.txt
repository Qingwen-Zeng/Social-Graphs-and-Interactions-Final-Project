History

]
Orange Town Arc
[
]
At the beginning of the arc, Luffy tried to capture Pinky to eat after being on the row boat without food for a few days. However, instead of Luffy catching the bird, he himself was caught instead and carried away. This caused
Zoro
to chase after Luffy and Pinky. Pinky was later shot at by
Buggy
around
Orange Town
, and he dropped Luffy there. He was not hit by the cannon fire, as he dropped the pirate before the cannonball's impact.
