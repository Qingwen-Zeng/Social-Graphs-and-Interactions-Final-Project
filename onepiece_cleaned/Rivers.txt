Bellamy
shouldn't get his hands dirty like people like Luffy, Zoro, and Nami, whom he doesn't consider to be on his level. After Bellamy's defeat, Rivers showed his cowardice, to the point of preventing Sarquiss from facing Luffy and, like the rest, doing nothing when Luffy took all of his captain's gold.

Bellamy
and
Sarquiss
. When Bellamy confronts Luffy at the Pub, Rivers is present with his other crewmates. After the crew has had their fill of ridiculing and beating up the obstinate Luffy and
Zoro
, Bellamy orders Rivers and
Ross
to throw the "garbage" outside, as they are taking up too much of their space. The two comply swiftly, kicking Zoro through a table and smashing Luffy's face into one of the pub's windows, severely injuring the both of them.
