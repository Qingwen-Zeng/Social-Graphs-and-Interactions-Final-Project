Jobo
is a citizen of
Mock Town
.
Appearance
[
]
He is a normal sized man, with stubble on his chin and upper lip. He has a large nose, and longish black hair. He wears a hat with a bandana underneath, and has a small scar under his right eye. Evidently a drunkard, his face is often flushed and lethargic-looking.
Personality
[
]
Jobo is apparently a heavy drinker, and will sometimes do his business out in public at night.
He claims to be tired of seeing more and more pirates coming to Jaya, but appears to respect
Bellamy
and
his crew
, because he warned them about the bounties on
Luffy
and
Zoro
.
History
[
]
Jaya Arc
[
]
Jobo was first formally seen urinating by the port and thanking the "god of Booze", but was actually among those who joined in with the
Bellamy Pirates
when they taunted
Luffy
,
Zoro
, and
Nami
in the bar.
He later receives a bundle of wanted posters delivered by a sea gull flying overhead. After initially mistaking it for newspapers, he realized what they actually were and started to inspect them, eventually coming across
Luffy
and
Zoro
's new bounties. At first, he thought that he had drunken too much when he tried to count Luffy's bounty, but eventually realized it was no mistake and his bounty was indeed
100,000,000. Shaken to the core, he immediately ran back to
Bellamy
to report this recent development.
Although Bellamy concluded that the new bounties were fakes, Jobo remained cautious of the possibility that they were not. His conjectures were later proven to be true when Luffy beat the over confident captain to the ground with a single punch.
