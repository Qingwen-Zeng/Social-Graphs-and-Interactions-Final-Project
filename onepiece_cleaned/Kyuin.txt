Kyuin is a very large woman with twintails that wears a coat and a dress with the word "SMILE", moreover, she wears a luchador mask covering most of her head and face—a feature common amongst Donquixote Pirates subordinates. On her right upper forearm is a tattoo of the kanji for the word "Factory"

Personality
[
]
Kyuin is confident of her own powers, believing herself to be the top within the factory. She can be infuriated when injured, and will use her authority to judge and execute anyone within the factory who strikes her displeasure, as when
Franky
used a suplex move on her to smash against
Senor Pink
, she threatened him viciously. However, once Franky kissed her to silence her rambling, she showed a more reserved and shy side.

As the boss of the SMILE Factory, she has authority over the entire facility. Kyuin is shown to be quite tough.
Weapons

History
[
]
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Franky suplexes Kyuin's head into Senor Pink's.
When the enslaved
Tontatta
dwarves
revolted and attempted to open the front doors of the
SMILE Factory
, Kyuin immediately stepped in and attacked them by sucking them with her vacuum. However, the dwarves managed to open the doors, allowing
Franky
to enter. After she recognized him as one of the people on
Donquixote Doflamingo
's hit list, Franky gave her a hug. When
Senor Pink
charged in, Franky used a suplex move to smash her head against that of Senor Pink's, causing Kyuin to fly into a fury. Franky then shut her up by kissing her. Confused at first, she blushingly told Franky to take responsibility for his actions and become her boyfriend only to be scolded by Senor Pink. She then watched as Franky and Senor Pink continued on with their battle.
Kyuin later rushed to Senor Pink's side after he was defeated by Franky.
Despite her affiliation with the
Donquixote Pirates
, she somehow evaded capture when the Marines arrested members of the crew.
