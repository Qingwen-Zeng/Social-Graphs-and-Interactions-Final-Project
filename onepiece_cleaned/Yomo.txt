Zou Arc

When the rest of the
Straw Hat Pirates
arrived on Zou,
Nami
was sleeping on Yomo's belly in the Right Belly Fortress. After
Tony Tony Chopper
came into the room to inform Nami of
Monkey D. Luffy
's arrival, Yomo expressed his happiness about her friends arriving and started sitting up a little too soon, causing Nami to stumble and fall, which he apologized for.
Shortly after, Yomo took part in the feast with the Straw Hats.
The following day, when
Inuarashi
,
Nekomamushi
, the samurai, and the pirates returned from the Whale Tree with
Raizo
, Zou began shaking as
Zunesha
started crying out, throwing Yomo and the others into a state of panic.
Jack had returned and was attempting to destroy Zou by killing Zunesha, who retaliated on
Kouzuki Momonosuke
's command and sank Jack's fleet with one blow, calming down Yomo and the others in the process.
Later on, he requested to go with the Sanji Retrieval Team because Nami liked sleeping on his belly, but was told to stay behind on Zou by Nekomamushi.
