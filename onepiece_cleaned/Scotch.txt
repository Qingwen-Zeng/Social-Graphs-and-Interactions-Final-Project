"Iron Boy" Scotch
is a member of the
Beasts Pirates
working as the guardian of one of the former
Emperor
Kaidou
's favorite islands.
Appearance
[
]
Scotch's concept art from the anime.
Scotch is a large man of great height. He is also a
cyborg
with modified body parts. His shoulders and head are covered in metal plating and his face is completely white and also appears to be made out of metal. He has a triple-barrel gun in place of his right hand.
He wears a large maroon winter jacket with gray pauldrons on its shoulders with the number "18" on each of them, a black cavalier hat with a long and wild red plume, pink trousers with purple stripes, and black boots on his small feet.
Personality
[
]
Scotch appears to be a rather passive individual. While determined to protect the island, he seems to prefer to not fight and casually warns people that the island belongs to Kaidou and tells them to leave. He clarified to X Drake that he is not threatening him but that he is simply warning him. However, when he notices that a battle is about to start and cannot be avoided anymore, he will attack.
When duty calls and his services are needed, Scotch seems to have a ruthless streak of sorts, evidenced when he crushed
Gaburu
's rebellion in cold blood to teach the revolutionaries a lesson, and even has no qualms against attacking an old woman.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the Emperor Kaidou entrusted him as a guardian of one of his favorite islands, Scotch is undoubtedly a powerful fighter. Indeed, he single-handedly overwhelmed
Gaburu
's rebellion,
while surviving an encounter with
Super Rookie
X Drake invading the island. However, despite being a trusted subordinate of Kaidou, he is apparently powerless against a
Logia
user, as Caribou was able to defeat him without much problem.
Weapons
[
]
Scotch wields a large sword on his back so it's safe to presume that he is proficient in using it. His right hand has also been outfitted with a large triple barrel gun, and most of his body is covered in protective metal plating.
History

Past
[
]
At some point in the past, Scotch joined the Beasts Pirates and was also converted into a cyborg for unknown reasons. He was then entrusted by Kaidou in guarding one of his favorite islands in the New World, which is a winter island where the inhabitants were forced to manufacture weapons.
Summit War Saga
[

Post-War Arc
[
]
After the
Summit War of Marineford
, Scotch's island was visited by the
Worst Generation
member, X Drake. Scotch proceeded to tell Drake that the island is a favorite of Kaidou's and is under his protection. Drake then asked if attacking Scotch would gain the Emperor's attention, to which he answered yes. Drake then activated his
Devil Fruit
and prepared to engage the cyborg in battle.
During the Timeskip
[
]
It is unknown how his battle with Drake ended, though both evidently survived. While Drake joined the Beasts Pirates, Scotch returned to his duty of protecting the island.
Dressrosa Saga

Caribou's Kehihihihi in the New World
[
]
Scotch attacking Gaburu's revolutionaries.
Two years after fighting Drake, Scotch learned that a group of revolutionaries who were led by the deceased
Gaburu
were staging a rebellion against Scotch's reign, so he went out to put a stop to them, unaware that the pirate,
Caribou
, who had previously washed ashore on the island, was at the scene as well. After single-handedly defeating them all, he and his men proceeded to set fire to their flag and the rest of the town as example to any who oppose him.
He then attacked the home of Gaburu's grandmother and cruelly knocked the old woman away, much to the shock of Caribou, but she got back up and prepared to take on the cyborg to give Caribou a chance to escape.
Caribou defeats Scotch.
Scotch subdued the old woman and planned to execute her as an example for Gaburu's army.
However, he then saw a Marine ship approaching with Caribou (while posing as Gaburu) and
his crew
on it.
While their subordinates fought it out, Scotch battled with Caribou himself. He attempted to shoot at the pirate, but his bullets were ineffective due to Caribou's
swampy body
.
Caribou got the upper hand by surrounding the cyborg and his men in quicksand and then suffocating him by forcing mud into his mouth.
It is unknown if Scotch is alive after this.
