Marin
is a male slave who was forced to dress as a
mermaid
by his owner.
Appearance
[
]
Marin is a large, overweight man. He dresses like a woman due to being forced, with long blonde hair and makeup. He has stubble around his mouth and sports a swimsuit that covers his chest. He wore a fake mermaid tail, and had a slave chain around his neck.
Personality
[
]
Marin seemed quite tired and distressed while swimming in his aquarium-like cell, since he is not a real mermaid and cannot breathe underwater.
History
[
]
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
[
]
Sometime before he was presented to
Luffy
,
Hatchan
, and
Pappag
while they were searching slave shops for
Camie
, he was captured by slavers and became a slave. Marin was restrained by a chain collar and could barely swim in his aquarium-like cell. The owner of the slave shop presented him to the group, but the terrible disguise did not fool them (not even Luffy, who is known to be easily tricked by disguises.)
