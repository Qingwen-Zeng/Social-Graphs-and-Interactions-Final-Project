As he attempted to strangle Luffy, he also spoke ill of Sanji. This enraged Luffy and he broke free from Cabaletta's grasp. Luffy grabbed Cabaletta by the hair to keep him from getting away and struck him with a Hawk Rifle to the face, sending him crashing into a wall and knocking him out.

Unlike in the manga, Cabaletta is given a more prominent appearance in the anime, where he is also given a formal introduction. During the battle against Luffy and Nami outside Sweet City, the anime adds scenes of Cabaletta attacking Luffy. Another addition in the anime is Cabaletta later battling against Luffy at the Whole Cake Chateau.
