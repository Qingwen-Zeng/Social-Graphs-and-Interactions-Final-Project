Egghead Arc

When
Nefertari Vivi
and
Wapol
were taken into hiding by the
World Economy News Paper
, Chinode gave one of her outfits for Vivi to wear. Chinode was delighted that the
princess
was wearing her clothes, and vowed to herself to never wash them again.
Sometime later, Chinode would loan Vivi more of her clothes. When the WENP HQ caught wind of Vegapunk's broadcasted message being signaled across the
World
via Marine comms traffic, Chinode was still admiring Vivi, unfocused on the message.
Following the end of the broadcast, Chinode continued to admire Vivi as she bickered with Morgans over his future news stories.
