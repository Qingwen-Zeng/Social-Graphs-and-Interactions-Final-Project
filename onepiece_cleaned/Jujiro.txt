Jujiro was walking through the
Flower Capital
when he passed either
Usopp
,
Shachi
,
Bepo
, or
Penguin
and was handed a piece of paper.
Jujiro was among those arrested and thrown in
Rasetsu Town
for conspiring to defy Orochi.
In prison, he and the others received
Shimotsuki Yasuie
's final message of the rebels' new gathering place.
Six days before the raid on Onigashima, Jujiro and the other samurai were still trapped in Rasetsu Town, and continued to be only two days prior to the raid.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Jujiro and the other rebels were freed from Rasetsu Town by
Denjiro
, adding 1,000 soldiers to the raid's forces. The group sailed to
Tokage Port
to retrieve the Scabbards and commence the raid.
Jujiro joined the resistance and traveled with the Kouzuki Family's other allies to
Onigashima
, donning a
disguise
upon arrival.
Jujiro joined
Kin'emon
's Eastern forces, and the group approached a
brothel
. The group split up but heard
someone
from inside the brothel. They all jumped in the water to hide, except
Chopper
and
Usopp
who were riding in the
Brachio Tank V
.
The group invaded the
Live Floor
, Jujiro,
Monjiro
, and
Omasa
cut down the Beasts Pirates that stood in their way.
