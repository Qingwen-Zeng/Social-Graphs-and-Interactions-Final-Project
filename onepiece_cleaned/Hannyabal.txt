Hannyabal
is the warden of
Impel Down
. He was introduced in the
Impel Down Arc
as the Vice Warden
and secondary antagonist, but during the two year timeskip, was promoted to
Magellan
's former position and is now in charge of Impel Down.
Due to his actions and role he is a major antagonist in the
Impel Down Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Hannyabal is a large pot-bellied man that resembles a cross between a devil and an Egyptian pharaoh. His brow ridge is shaped like horns, his chin is shaped like a pharaoh's false beard, and he wears a
nemes
with yellow and green stripes, the striped head cloth worn by pharaohs, with his hair coming from inside the nemes. His face in particular is designed in such a way that it looks like a Hannya mask. He wears demon-like wings on his back and also carries a pitchfork around, another common symbol linked to the devil.
22 years ago, when
Shiki
escaped the prison, Hannyabal was seen wearing the standard militaristic white uniform that normal guards wear. He still wore the nemes and the bat-like wings, but he also wore a cap over the former. Now, he goes bare-chested in reference to his great endurance.
After his original nemes had been stolen by
Mr. 2 Bon Kurei
, his new one has a fox figurehead attachment on top that resembles the Egyptian jackal God of Death Anubis and has blue stripes instead of the green stripes. Overall, his appearance is an allegory to the underworld.
After the timeskip, he now wears an outfit similar to
Magellan
, but without the horns that Magellan wears. He also appears to have gained a significant amount of weight.
As child Hannyabal was rather chubby. He wore nothing but a leaf-skirt and a pair of black sandals. He is depicted as a fire-dancer.
Personality
[
]
He has a habit of saying he owns everything and then having to apologize afterwards for getting ahead of himself. He does this because he is an ambitious person.
He also seems to be prone to "
Freudian Slips
", which often give insight to his previously mentioned, ambitious qualities and his somewhat dark brand of humor.
Hannyabal usually tries to show off how tough he really is to the prisoners by going into the Freezing Hell of Level 5 without weapons and almost completely naked, a reason he is admired amongst the guards.
He is emotionally more stern than most characters and can maintain a clear mind even in the presence of
Boa Hancock
, remaining unaffected by her charms. Despite this, he seems to be easily infatuated with beautiful women, as he let slip of his true ambitions towards Hancock. This might have been because "she wasn't his kind of woman" as later he was easily seduced by
Nami
(who was really
Bentham
in disguise
)
and by
Olive
in the anime.
Hannyabal's desire to become Warden by eliminating Magellan causes him to willingly jeopardize the security of Impel Down, such as letting prisoners run away, if it means for a chance to pin the blame on his superior.
In short, Hannyabal cares more about his own position than the security and welfare of the prison, however he seems only willing to let prisoners escape if they are relatively harmless (ex. Buggy and Mr. 3) and shows genuine concern when powerful prisoners escape, like Crocodile and Jinbe.
Despite his seemingly lack of seriousness most of the time, due to his desire to get Magellan fired, Hannyabal may get serious when the situation gets to the extreme, especially if he risks getting fired too. When this sudden change occurs, it can surprise even people who know him.
Even though his ambition gets the better of him most of the time, those selfish aspects of his disappear completely when he feels the safety of civilians are on the line, such as dangerous prisoners escaping. It turns out that he is a considerate person who became a jailer to protect the lives of innocents by keeping criminals in prison. Furthermore, he was the only high-ranking jailer who was never shown torturing the inmates or to enjoy doing so.
This other side of his personality is the reason he became a jailer in the first place, and the level of willpower he displays in this mindset is reminiscent to Luffy himself. Even when completely overwhelmed and near the brink of death, he will force himself to stay conscious and keep dangerous prisoners from escaping even when he barely has any strength left. Almost paralleling Luffy in many of his fights, he will grab onto his opponent limbs while on the ground and nearly beaten, to just barely hold them back before getting up and continuing to fight.
His ideology towards pirates capable of great destruction like Luffy, Jinbe, or Crocodile is very different from most marines who believe in Absolute Justice. To him, he doesn't damn pirates and revolutionaries as evil or enemies of the World Government. He damns them because most committed grand crimes, and regardless of what those crimes were, they have enough power to create great alarm to the normal citizens of this world. He loathes the glorification of piracy, as those reputations were all created by breaking the law and becoming criminals, including Ace and Luffy. And thus, if powerful criminals are able to escape, the citizens of the world would fall into panic knowing dangerous criminals remained unchecked in the world and can even escape from Impel Down. He is willing to lay down his life even in a losing battle for this belief.
Relationships
[
]
Impel Down Staff
[
]
A typical relationship between Magellan and Hannyabal.
Hannyabal was often at odds with his superior
Magellan
from his apparent "lack" of duty and would not hesitate to scold Magellan for things like neglecting the intruder call on Luffy because he was distracted by Hancock's charms, to which he constantly  to be rid of Magellan so he could make a better chief warden in his place. Even when not suffering from Freudian Slips, Hannyabal would constantly complain and openly express his desire to be chief warden, often within earshot of the latter much to his own buffoonery. This would often causes frequent scoldings from Magellan and even suffer from his poisonous breath.
Despite their conflicting disagreements in leadership, Magellan fully trusts him and states he is the only one beside himself who is able to run Impel Down.
He seems to have a good reputation among the personnel and his courage during serious situations is admired by the jailers.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As the current warden of Impel Down, Hannyabal has full control over Impel Down.
In terms of combat prowess, Hannyabal is one of the most powerful enforcers in Impel Down, being more powerful than any of the Four
Jailer Beasts
(all of whom are
awakened
Zoan
users). He easily defeated both Buggy and Mr. 3 without a single scratch on him, even after taking a direct hit from Buggy's
Muggy Ball
(which was enough to severely harm the Jailer Beast
Minotaurus
and annihilate the entire platoon of jailers guarding the door to Level 3 ). Within the prison his strength second only to
Magellan
. Magellan himself claimed that Hannyabal is the only person worthy to be his successor as Chief Warden of Impel Down, and this is later proven when after the two year time-skip Hannyabal was shown to have indeed succeeded Magellan as Chief Warden.
However, unlike Magellan or the Jailer Beasts, Hannyabal seems to lack a feared reputation for the prisoners to acknowledge, as Buggy and Mr. 3 stated that they had not heard anything about him.
A possible explanation is that he will not fight unless it is an extreme emergency, such as a prisoner from Level 5 or Level 6 trying to escape. If not, he will not move a finger and leave the job to the Jailer Beasts or Magellan. On the other hand, the guards seem to know him to be a powerful fighter and enforcer.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Hannyabal also seems to have a resistance to extreme temperatures, as he is known to walk through the Freezing Hell with nothing more than his loincloth and nemes,
as well as tolerating the extreme heat in Level 4 in the very same attire. He is also very resilient to physical strikes, and is capable of withstanding some of Luffy's
Gear Second
attacks and get back up on his feet.
Weapons
[
]
Further information:
Kessui
Hannyabal wielding his double-bladed naginata, Kessui.
Weapon-wise, Hannyabal was seen wielding a pitchfork, like many of his subordinates, but has not been seen using that in battle (except in the anime). Instead, his signature weapon is a
polearm
based on a double-bladed naginata (a Japanese halberd) called "Kessui", which he is quite skilled in wielding. With a katana on each side, he is capable of performing a variety of attacks with it, and, most surprisingly, is also able to spin it wildly and create flames to deter any opponent.
The fact that he is capable of using with such skill a weapon with two blades, which could potentially injure an inexperienced user, as well as the enemy, is a testament to his swordsmanship.
History
[

Past
[
]
Hannyabal, 22 years ago as an Impel Down guard, surprised by Shiki.
22 years prior to the start of the current storyline,
Shiki
made his escape from his holding cell by cutting off his legs. A 13 year old Hannyabal found Shiki sitting on the rafters of Level 6 asking him if he had seen Shiki's swords. A shocked Hannyabal then shouted for help from
Magellan
(then only the vice-warden), but not before shouting he wanted a promotion.
Summit War Saga
[

Impel Down Arc
[
]
Hannyabal was informed about
Buggy
's escape and
Devil Fruit
powers before being notified of
Vice Admiral
Momonga
and
Warlord of the Sea
Boa Hancock
's arrival at Impel Down.
Hannyabal greeted them, informing them that
Magellan
was down on Level 4, and ordered
Domino
to do a body search on Hancock. When Hancock
petrified
Domino and the
Surveillance Den Den Mushi
, the guards reported the loss of feed to Hannyabal, who went to check on the women. After
Monkey D. Luffy
had slipped out of her clothing and hidden in the room, Hancock unpetrified Domino, and the women finished the inspection and left the room. When Hancock complained about the
Seastone
handcuffs, Hannyabal informed her that they were part of the prison's rules. He then escorted Hancock and Momonga to a lift to go to Level 4. Before they descended, Hannyabal warned Hancock about the heat on Level 4 and the screams she would hear from the other floors, and she fainted due to a misunderstanding of Luffy's response, although Hannyabal was unaware of the true cause.
While they waited in the Warden's office, they discussed Magellan's daily routine. Once Magellan exited the bathroom, Hannyabal complained about the Warden's poison-filled diet before informing him about Momonga and Hancock's wish to visit
Portgas D. Ace
. While Hancock chastised Magellan for
breathing out poisonous gas
, Hannyabal sat in the Warden's chair, believing it would be his one day. When a call came in on the Warden's Den Den Mushi, Hannyabal initially answered it, but Magellan breathed poison at him and then took the chair and receiver for himself. The guards informed Magellan that someone had broken into Impel Down, a first for the prison, which Hannyabal characterized as a serious calamity and blamed on Magellan.
Hannyabal, alongwith Magellan, Domino, and Momonga, escorted Hancock down to Level 6 and introduced her to Ace and
Jinbe
. Magellan cuffed Hannyabal for going overboard with the introduction. When the other prisoners grew rowdy over Hancock's presence, Hannyabal joined in the shouting, calling for Magellan to resign. As punishment for the prisoners' disrespectful comments toward Hancock, Magellan lashed out with his
Hydra
technique, and because Hannyabal moved away to avoid getting poisoned too, he did not overhear Hancock's message to Ace.
Afterwards, Magellan and Hannyabal returned to the Warden's office, while Hancock and Momonga returned to the surface.
At the office, Magellan was updated on Luffy's break in and whereabouts, as well as the identities of Luffy's accomplices:
Buggy
,
Galdino
, and
Bentham
. When Magellan expressed frustration on not being update sooner, Hannyabal pointed out that he had been too distracted by Hancock. With
Saldeath
and the
Blugori
handling the rioters on Level 2, Magellan ordered the rest of the prison's forces to gather on Level 4. Hannyabal was shocked when Magellan added that he would personally execute Luffy and his accomplices if they made it down to Level 4.
While they were waiting at base of the stairwell connecting Levels 3 and 4, they were informed that Luffy and his accomplices had instead fallen down the well and avoided the boiling pond, so Magellan split the group into three, leaving Hannyabal to guard the stairwell to Level 3. Hannyabal thought about letting Luffy and the others escape past him so it could be blamed on Magellan, but the Warden threatened both Hannyabal and
Sadi
before heading out to find Luffy.
Hannyabal defeats and captures Buggy and Galdino.
While Luffy and Magellen were fighting, Buggy and Galdino attempted to fight their way past Hannyabal.
Although the Vice Warden told them they could pass, they persisted in attacking him directly, so he fought back and easily defeated both Buggy and Galdino.
Shortly after, however, Bentham beat up Hannyabal's men and then
disguised
himself as
Nami
. Hannyabal was distracted and confused by Nami's sudden appearance and then lured into a storeroom, in which Bentham bound and gagged the Vice Warden and stole his clothes.
Afterwards, Bentham masqueraded as Hannyabal.
Hannyabal was discovered hours later.
After he has been released, the guards tell him that Buggy, Galdino and Bentham, the latter having been disguised as Hannyabal, have descended down to Level 5. The only thing they found was Hannyabal's stolen nemes, which was covered in blood. Under the report of the guards, Hannyabal found that if the four intruders were not eaten by the wolves, but instead escaped, then not only Magellan, but also Hannyabal himself, would risk losing their officer positions, much to Hannyabal's shock.
He is then later seen in the monitor room, surprised to see Luffy, Iva and Inazuma heading down to Level 6. He then tells a guard to inform the jailers of Level 6 to prepare for combat while Sadi-chan gets there with the Jailer Beasts. He also tells the guard to inform Magellan and all floors of this discovery and to activate all the traps in the passage that lead to Level 6. This sudden turn of seriousness makes the guard question whether Hannyabal is an impostor.
As Magellan was busy with Ace's transfer, Hannyabal was in charge of the prison. During his leadership, he learns Luffy, Inazuma and Ivankov has freed both
Jinbe
and
Crocodile
for allies. Hannyabal orders all jailers to gather at Level 4, intending to face the escaped prisoners himself, fearing the incident could cost him his position, but is informed about another riot going on on Level 2 started by Buggy and Galdino as well as an army led by Iva, Inazuma, and Bentham consisting of prisoners that were thought lost forever and is unsure what he should do.
Still undecided about how to deal with the current situation, Hannyabal learns that Blackbeard and his crew are invading Impel Down. Now with 2 situations on his hands he struggles to make a decision and casually asks the other jailers if they should lock themselves in the monitor room and have snacks, much to the shock of the jailers. He then gets a Den Den Mushi call from
Magellan
, having told him that the riot on Level 2 is over, and with Magellan giving him an order to hold out on Level 4 until he gets there. In an ironic sense of relief, Hannyabal cheers the warden on.
Hannyabal vs. Luffy.
Hannyabal finally faces Luffy and the rest of the rioting prisoners on the door that connects Level 3 and Level 4. He is backed by the
Bazooka Unit
and tells the freed prisoners that they do not have chance, bringing out his Naginata "Kessui." Luffy simply orders him to get out of the way. Hannyabal refuses and attempts to fight him with his
Hanya Carnival
move
Shounetsu Jigoku-Guruma
. However, Luffy uses Gear Second, and beats him back with the
Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling
.
Even so, Hannyabal refuses to give in and attempts to stop Luffy even when beaten and bloody as the jailers beg him to stop for his own sake. Hannyabal proceeds to give a speech about why "scum" like Luffy have no right to be free.
Blackbeard defeats Hannyabal.
He goes on to say that because innocent people are threatened and frightened by the very existence of pirates, Impel Down exists to keep evildoers locked up and protect the weak people outside. He claims that its destruction would result in more fear, and therefore he would not let Luffy pass and thereby escape. Luffy once again refuses, saying that Ace was precious to him. Hannyabal bitterly reflects that some people refuse to listen. Then the Bazooka Unit begins to vanish into
Blackbeard
's darkness as Blackbeard crushes Hannyabal under his feet and mocks his beliefs, stating that he could search the world and still there is no answer.
Magellan approaches the fallen Hannyabal.
After Blackbeard and his crew attempt to deal with Magellan, Magellan quickly douses them with poison and disposes of them. He then acknowledges the battered and bloody Hannyabal and thanks him for holding out for so long. Magellan leaves Impel Down to Hannyabal and tells him not to die, admitting that Hannyabal is his only worthy successor. However, Hannyabal was not conscious to hear that praise.
Then, Magellan orders the guards to give Hannyabal the medical attention he needs for the wounds inflicted by Luffy and Teach.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In an anime flashback, it was stated that twenty years ago was about the time Hannyabal joined the prison, and the first prisoner he had to deal with was
Olive
, who seduced him to lower his guard, and then tied him up and stole his clothing, for escape, and would have succeeded if not for Magellan interfering. Magellan then gave him a speech on how every single guard is important for the security of the prison.
In the anime, when he adorned his new fox-headed nemes he commented that this one was supposed to be for when he became warden.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
While some translations may use "Hannibal" as the English spelling for his name, this is wrong. The name Hannibal in Japanese would be written like this: ハンニバル (hannibaru), while Hannyabal's name appears in the manga as ハンニャバル (hannyabaru), a clear combination of both Hannibal and Hannya which is ハンニャ.
