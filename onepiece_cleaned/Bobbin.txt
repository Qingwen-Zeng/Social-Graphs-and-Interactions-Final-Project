"Sweeper" Bobbin
is a bishop-ranked
combatant
of the
Big Mom Pirates
.
Due to his actions and role, he is a minor antagonist in the
Whole Cake Island Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Bobbin is a rather short yet broad individual with a wide grin and thick, red lips who wears a white mask covering a portion of his face. He has rather strange body proportions, as his shoulders appears to be higher than his chin and his arms are twice the length of his legs. His mask also features dark glasses, which obscure his eyes. He carries a sword larger than himself which is slung over his back and a black hat with a big white tuft sticking out of it. He also sports purple and black pinstriped pants with a large brown belt holding them up, a pink shirt, brown gloves, dark boots, and a long light blue cape which is also bigger than Bobbin himself.
Personality
[
]
Bobbin seems to be quite ruthless, as shown when he reported to
Big Mom
after burning down an entire country and seemed pleased with himself for doing so. Furthermore, he is very loyal to his captain and shows absolutely no concern for islands that cannot pay her tribute. He even asked Linlin if she also wanted to burn
Fish-Man Island
when he heard that they could not deliver her any candy for quite a while.
He also seems to be very confident in his strength, choosing to pursue Sanji on his own without the aid of his crewmates.
He also seems to be gluttonous and disrespectful of other people's property, as seen when he took a piece of meat from a basket that Sanji was carrying.
Bobbin has a habit of bobbing his head side to side when talking. Bobbin also has a
signature laugh
, starting with "Bo", continuing with "yoyo", and ending with an "n" ("Boyoyon").
Relationships
[

Crew
[
]
Unlike most of the other members of the crew, Bobbin does not seem to fear his
captain
in the slightest as shown when he came up to her upon his return and had a friendly chat with her. He is very considerate to Big Mom as he gladly delivers sweets to her from other islands.
Enemies
[

Sanji Retrieval Team
[
]
Bobbin became an enemy of the Straw Hats when Luffy defeated Charlotte Cracker. Bobbin gathered with the rest of his crewmates and attacked Luffy before capturing him and Nami.
He later tried to steal food from Sanji only to be viciously attacked by the latter.
Bobbin was angered by Sanji's actions and attempted to pursue him before he was ambushed by
Vito
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Bobbin was sent to burn down an island that failed to make its monthly tribute, a task in which he succeeded alongside several comrades.
He has a great reputation, as
Germa Kingdom
princes
Vinsmoke Niji
and
Vinsmoke Yonji
recognized him as a heavyweight within the Big Mom Pirates, which is notable considering the vast size and strength of the crew.
Bobbin was able to help bring down Luffy (while in his
Gear 2
form) during the
Big Mom Pirates
' attack on him and Nami.
However, Bobbin can let his guard down easily, like when he took the meat out of Sanji's bento box, the cook was able to swiftly smash Bobbin into a wall with one kick, leaving Bobbin shocked and injured on the floor.
This was seen again after Bobbin left the castle to chase Sanji. During the pursuit, he was ambushed and shot by Vito.
Although it is worth mentioning that Bobbin was able to recover from Sanji's attack in a relatively short amount of time, indicating a sufficient level of endurance and durability on his part,

[
]

Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
Bobbin leads an army to take down Luffy and Nami.
After
Monkey D. Luffy
defeated
Charlotte Cracker
, Bobbin and an army marched towards Luffy's location and started battling him.
Once Luffy and
Nami
were overwhelmed, Big Mom's army learned that the
Vivre Card
Nami had in her possession came from
Lola
, which surprised them. The army then headed back to Sweet City with the captured
Straw Hat Pirates
.
In the Prisoner Library, Bobbin and some of the
Charlotte Family
sat and listened as Big Mom spoke to the captive Luffy and Nami through a
Den Den Mushi
.
After
Anglais
brought word of an intruder in the castle, all but
Charlotte Opera
left the library.
Bobbin is attacked by Sanji.
As he later wandered in
Whole Cake Ch√¢teau
, he encountered
Sanji
and tried to eat the meat from the bento box next to him. Sanji, out of rage that someone tried to eat the dish meant for his captain, violently kicked him into a wall before running away, much to Bobbin's shock.
Some of Bobbin's crewmates raced to the scene to find out what happened, but Bobbin put them to sleep, intent on fixing the situation himself. He then broke off into a sprint, saying that even demons would attend Big Mom's
tea parties
.
Sometime after leaving the castle, Bobbin was ambushed and shot by
Vito
and collapsed from his wounds shortly afterwards.
Vito later told Bege that he had disposed of Bobbin.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Bobbin's body at the scene of the crime.
The anime adds a scene of
Mont-d'Or
and
Galette
talking to a group of
Chess Soldiers
who discovered Bobbin's body in the alley and explicitly states that Bobbin was killed.
However, in the manga, he is not seen afterwards and his final status remains unverified aside from Vito's claim that he was "disposed of".
