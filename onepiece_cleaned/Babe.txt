"Catcher-Killing" Babe
,
better known by his alias
Mr. 4
, is a former
officer agent
of the
Baroque Works
and partner of
Miss Merry Christmas
.
He is also
Lassoo
's owner.
He was a major antagonist during the
Arabasta Arc
. After the group's dissolution, he became a pizza delivery boy, stationed at the new
Spiders Cafe
.
Appearance
[
]
Babe is rather tall and fat, has big lips, dirty blonde hair, and wears a green shirt that covers most of his body with black pants and gray running shoes. Like all other
officer agents
, his number is expressed somewhere on his clothing or his person. He has an obscure "4" design on his shirt, as well as a "4" on his baseball bat.
During
Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works"
, he wore a typical striped prisoner uniform and retained his scarf.
Personality
[
]
Babe was the slow and dimwitted partner of
Miss Merry Christmas
. He seems incapable of thinking for himself at all and often just does as his partner tells him to do. He laughs freely, but speaks rarely—in contrast to his partner. He speaks very slowly, usually taking most of a scene to articulate a short sentence. However, before he swings his bat he screams "Fore!" slowly, something which is slightly odd as this action is more associated with the sport of golf instead of baseball.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Babe's four ton bat.
He is one of two
officer agents
without a Devil Fruit ability, the other being
Miss Goldenweek
. He is tremendously strong, able to wield a baseball bat that weighs 4-tons with no effort and his bat swings can destroy bricks from long distances from the shockwaves alone.
However, he is also extremely slow in nature and would not succeed without Miss Merry Christmas handling the "intelligence". His slow tendencies only apply to his intellect and casual walking speed though, as he is able to travel in Miss Merry Christmas' tunnels at tremendous speed and hit several baseballs at once. Crocodile has noted that he and his partner are actually stronger in terms of physical power than the
Mr. 3
team, but are a lower rank because Mr. 3 is smarter and more tactical.
In spite of his generally low intelligence, Mr. 4 is apparently smart enough to calculate the exact time at which each of his baseball bombs will go off, allowing him to know exactly when to direct them at his intended target.
Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas have great teamwork during battle, with Mr. 4 being capable of using Miss Merry Christmas' hole network to surprise the enemy and Miss Merry Christmas can restrain the enemy or even bring him closer to Mr. 4 so he can directly strike the enemy with his bat.
Lassoo
[

Further information:
Lassoo
and
Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Dachshund
Babe has a dog called
Lassoo
, which was originally a gun, but "ate" the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Dachshund, a
Devil Fruit
, and became a gun-dog. Lassoo shoots timed exploding baseballs that weigh as much as cannonballs, even when he sneezes (when he's first introduced, he has a cold). Mr. 4 then takes out his 4-ton baseball bat and hits the balls at his enemies, launching them at great velocity and accuracy at different angles. Due to the weight, the cannonballs cannot be thrown back by an opponent of normal strength.
Techniques
[
]
Yonhyappon Punk Knock
(
四百本猛打ノック
,
Yonhyappon Panku Nokku
?
, literally meaning "Four Hundred Punk Knock")
: This attack is not named by him, but by his partner Drophy. Babe has Lassoo shoot a huge group of his exploding baseballs and then hits them back at a surprisingly swift speed into a cluster, so they detonate all at once and create a massive explosion.
This attack is called
400 Base Hits
in the Viz Manga,
400 Base Knock
in the 4Kids and FUNimation dubs and
400-swing Punk Knocks
in the Funimation subs.
Mogurazuka Yonban Kousaten
(
モグラ塚4番交差点
,
Mogurazuka Yonban Kōsaten
?
, literally meaning "Molehill Intersection Number 4")
: A combo attack with Drophy, first, Drophy uses
Mogurazuka Highway
and carries the opponent past Babe who, upon hearing her call out the attack, smacks the captive with his 4-ton bat, causing massive damage.
However, he may accidentally hit an ally as he is too dim witted to note differences in the voice.
This is called
Moletown Cleanup Hitter
in the Viz Manga and the FUNimation dub of
Movie 8
,
Woodchuck Batter Blaster
in the 4Kids dub, and
Molehill Intersection #4
in the FUNimation dub.
History
[
]
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Arabasta Arc
[
]
As members of
Baroque Works
, Babe (under his alias of "Mr. 4") and his partner
Miss Merry Christmas
were summoned by
Mr. 0
to the
Spiders Cafe
in order to get their assignments for the final phase of
Operation Utopia
. While they waited for the other Officer Agents to arrive, Mr. 4 gave Miss Merry Christmas a back massage, and laughed at
Mr. 2
's dance.
Mr. 4 next traveled with the other Officer Agents to
Rainbase
, where it was revealed that Mr. 0 was actually the
Warlord of the Sea
Crocodile. After the revelation, Mr. 4 and his companions were informed of Baroque Work's true goal and the steps needed to fulfill it.
For their specific mission, Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas were assigned to kidnap King
Nefertari Cobra
, allowing for Mr. 2 to impersonate him and admit that he had been hoarding a supply of
Dance Powder
, inciting the
Yuba
rebels to attack the capital,
Alubarna
.
After completing their task, Mr. 4's team rejoined the other Officer Agents at Alubarna's gates, attempting to stop
Nefertari Vivi
from reaching the advancing rebels. Once the agents became unable to identify Vivi from the
Straw Hat Pirates
, Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas unknowingly pursue
Sanji
and
Tony Tony Chopper
to the city's south-east gate. At first, Chopper had to fight the two alone as Sanji left to check on Vivi, but later
Usopp
arrives to assist him in fighting the Mr. 4 team in Sanji's place.
Mr. 4 fights Usopp.
Shortly after Usopp arrives, Mr. 4 calls upon
Lassoo
; his anthropomorphic gun-dog, to assist him, much to the horror of Usopp and Chopper, who also note the apparent strength of Mr. 4's metal bat. Utilizing both Lassoo's exploding baseballs and Miss Merry Christmas' network of tunnels, the pair initially seemed to have the upper-hand against the Straw Hat Pirates. However, Mr. 4 becomes briefly incapacitated after he was hit over the head with a seemingly 5-ton hammer by Usopp.
After regaining consciousness from his injury and learning that the 5-ton hammer was actually a fake, Mr. 4 is ordered by his partner to attack Chopper with a volley of exploding baseballs. In the midst of dodging Mr. 4's baseball onslaught, Chopper realizes that all of Miss Merry Christmas' tunnels are connected. Throwing sand into Lassoo's face, Chopper has the dog sneeze into one of the holes, causing the tunnel network to erupt and catch Mr. 4 and his comrades in a massive explosion.
Having survived Chopper's plan, Miss Merry Christmas grabs Usopp by his feet and drags him towards Mr. 4. Together, they successfully execute the
Mogurazuka Yonban Kousaten
technique, leading to Usopp being struck in the head by Mr. 4's metal baseball bat. After Usopp survives the blow, the pair ready to preform the attack again. However, Usopp is able to slip out of Miss Merry Christmas' grasp and Chopper picks her up with his horns, continuing to run at Mr. 4. Then, disguising his voice to be that of his partner, Usopp calls for Mr. 4 to preform the attack. He does so, unknowingly hitting Miss Merry Christmas with his bat instead of Usopp. With Mr. 4 having become distracted by the revelation, Usopp defeats the officer agent by shooting an extremely fast hammer at him, knocking Mr. 4 (as well as Lassoo) into a nearby stone structure. An unconscious Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas were then hit by one of Lassoo's exploding baseballs which fell from his mouth.
After Operation Utopia failed with the defeat of Crocodile, Mr. 4 was found and arrested by the Marines headed by Tashigi.
He, along with the other arrested Baroque Works agents were then sent to prison.
