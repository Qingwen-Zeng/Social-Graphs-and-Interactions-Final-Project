Zou Arc

When
Bariete
rang the bell and spoke of the arrival of samurai, Giovanni and the rest of the minks rushed to Kurau City. When
Kin'emon
and
Kanjuro
revealed themselves, Giovanni and the minks welcomed them and revealed that
Raizo
was on
Zou
before standing proudly at having kept his presence a secret.
Kin'emon showed Giovanni and the other minks the crest of the
Kouzuki Family
on his back to confirm his allegiance. When Inuarashi and
Nekomamushi
reluctantly called a truce for the sake of
Kouzuki Momonosuke
, whom they recognized as their lord, Giovanni and the rest of the minks were overjoyed.
When Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, the samurai, and the pirates returned from the Whale Tree with
Raizo
, Zou began shaking as
Zunesha
started crying out, throwing Giovanni and the others into a state of panic.
Jack had returned and was attempting to destroy Zou by killing Zunesha, who retaliated on Momonosuke's command and sank Jack's fleet with one blow, calming down Giovanni and the others in the process.
Later on, Shishilian requested to accompany the Sanji retrieval team to
Whole Cake Island
along with Giovanni and
Concelot
, but was told to stay behind on Zou by Nekomamushi.

Having traveled with Inuarashi to
Wano
, Giovanni and his group found a severely injured
Tama
at a wasteland.
While having a discussion with Nami, Robin, Wanda, and Carrot in Amigasa Village two days before the raid on Onigashima, the Three Inuarashi Musketeers talked about how the weather conditions could affect their chances in battle. Giovanni mentioned that the full moon would be useless if it is blocked by clouds.
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Giovanni joined the Straw Hats on the Thousand Sunny as they entered the battle with the Beasts Pirates.
After disembarking on
Onigashima
, Giovanni joined the group led by Kin'emon. The group reached the Pleasure Hall owned by
Black Maria
. As they traversed through the area, they quickly hid themselves underwater when
Big Mom
looked outside from one of the nearby buildings.
As Big Mom chased after the
Brachio Tank V
, Kin'emon led the rest of the force onward.
After the all-out war began, the minks waiting on the roof of the Skull Dome until Kaido arrived there with the Scabbards. When Jack and a platoon arrived, the minks then transformed into their Sulong forms
and began decimating Jack's forces.
After a fierce battle, most of the minks were wounded from their fight against Jack.
As Kaido created wind scythes with a roar, the wounded minks fled from the roof.
Giovanni and his fellow minks later went to the fifth floor of the castle and cleared a path for Luffy, enabling him to reach the roof unhindered.
The Mokomo Dukedom celebrates Wano's victory.
A week after the defeat of Kaido and
Big Mom
, he enjoyed the festival in the Flower Capital with his friends.
After the festival, Giovanni joined the other minks, when Inuarashi and Nekomamushi gave Carrot the title of ruler of the Mokomo Dukedom, where they all supported her, since she possessed
