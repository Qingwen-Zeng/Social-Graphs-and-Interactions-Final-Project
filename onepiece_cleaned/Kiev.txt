Franky Family

Usopp
and stole
200,000,000 from him. When Usopp entered their house to take the money back, the Franky Family beat him up and threw him out. Moments later, they fought against

,
Zoro
,
Sanji

Chopper

CP9
. CP9 then beat up Kiev and the others before heading to Franky's hideout where they abducted Franky and Usopp.
When Luffy and his crew were preparing to board the
Rocketman
to rescue
Nico Robin
, Kiev and his comrades burst into the warehouse, begging Luffy to take the Franky Family with them, in order to save their boss. Luffy easily forgives the group and tells them to hurry up and board, but they decide to join them using their gigantic King Bulls,
Sodom

Gomorrah
.
Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
Upon arriving at
Enies Lobby
, the Franky Family along with the Straw Hats and the
Galley-La
workers laid down their plan of attack. The Franky Family were supposed to move in and open the main gate. Once they reached the main gate, they were faced against the two giants who guarded it,
Oimo
and
Kashii
. Kiev was on Zambai's team, which entered a fierce combat against the giants, and with the aid of Galley-La, they managed to bring them down, opened the gate and led the way for the incoming Straw Hat pirates. The team, riding the giant King Bulls, advanced towards the inner section of the island defeating foe after foe, until they reached the courthouse. There, they split into two groups in order to find the two separate switches that lower the bridge to the Tower of Justice. Zambai,
Paulie
and a handful of Franky Family members, including Kiev, engaged the Three-Headed Chief Justice
Baskerville
in combat but were eventually subdued and apparently defeated.
Upon the news of the Buster Call's issue reaching them, Kiev and his comrades are already freed by Paulie and desperately tried to make a move and escape the island. When they reached the coast, the Franky Family come across the warship led by Vice Admiral
Strawberry
, who ordered his men to attack the criminals. The group got bombed and thrown off a cliff but were all saved at the last minute by Paulie's ropes. With the Straw Hat Pirates drawing the attention of the Marines, Zambai and Paulie lead their men aboard the sea train, thus escaping the burning island.
Post Enies Lobby Arc
[
]
During the Straw Hats party, Kiev joined in alongside everyone else that participated in the Enies Lobby fight.
Later, after discovering that Franky became a wanted man, the Franky Family tried to convince him to join the Straw Hat Pirates. After
Tamagon
stole his swim briefs, Kiev was, at first, shocked by the idea but soon agreed upon it. They all ran away to Scrap Island so Franky could join the pirate crew waiting there for him. When Franky found them, he managed to defeat them easily, including Kiev, but not before Luffy got a hold on his swim briefs. Luffy and
Chopper
launched themselves back to Scrap Island as Kiev,
Sanji
, and
Zoro
launched Franky to the island with the "Everything Cannon".
After Franky argued with Luffy about joining, the Franky Family threw a bag packed with clothes and personal belongings and told him he should go. Through some "convincing" by Robin, Franky decided to go. Kiev and everyone else cried, remembering their former lives and how Franky bettered them.
