Avalo Pizarro
,
also known as the
"Corrupt King"
, is currently one of the
Ten Titanic Captains
, as the captain of the Fourth Ship.
Prior to his life of crime, he was once a
king
of a
North Blue
kingdom that overthrew him for his despotic ways.
He was then imprisoned in
Impel Down
and given a life sentence in Level 6, as his crimes were so atrocious, he had to effectively be erased from history. He has since been freed by
Marshall D. Teach
and has become a member of his crew.
Due to his actions and role, he is a supporting antagonist in the
Marineford Arc
, a minor antagonist in the
Egghead Arc
, and a major antagonist in the
Final Saga
.
Appearance
[
]
Unlike the other
Impel Down
escapees (barring
Shiryu
), he was not dressed in a prisoner's uniform even when incarcerated. Instead, he dresses in a regal attire, consisting of a long, white and dark brown patterned fur coat and light-purple necklaces.
He has many cat-like characteristics: his eyes are slit like a cat's and his cyan hair is a wild mane, with white horns attached to his head via black metal plates underneath. His mustache is a lighter blue than the rest of his hair, very large and droopy, sticking out about the same length as his shoulders; they resemble a cat's whiskers, fitting in with his feline-like appearance. He also has no eyebrows. Since his debut, his arms so far have always been somewhat obscured, but it can be seen at one point that he has black
vambraces
with a spiral design; in the anime, it was revealed that he was wearing black and dark bronze metallic gloves.
He is also revealed that some of his upper teeth are missing from his jaw. He is also about the same size and width as others amongst his new crew like
Blackbeard
.
After the timeskip, he has the beard finished in three points and wears an elaborate crown with the Blackbeard Pirates'
Jolly Roger
.
Personality
[
]
In most of his appearances, he is usually seen smiling, even when attacking
Whitebeard
. He also seems somewhat nostalgic about things and has a tendency to say "Nya" at the end of his sentences, the Japanese equivalent of "Meow". He also has quite a desire to become leader, as he was daring enough to ask (albeit in a joking manner) Teach to let him be the captain instead.
He does seem to be somewhat resentful, though, of Teach dominating the news headlines and openly fantasized about his name being in the news for quashing
Monkey D. Garp
's rescue mission on Hachinosu.
He also seems to be cool-headed and react to most situations with a casual attitude, as he showed no signs of concern or anger when Moria and his zombies were rampaging on
Hachinosu
, only commenting that they were noisy while eating and asking questions to his men about Moria. Despite his lack of concern when Moria attacked Hachinosu, he is shown to not want to attract the ire of Teach, as he did not want himself, nor Vasco Shot or Sanjuan Wolf, to go after escaped prisoners due to the damage it could cause.
During his time as a king, he was corrupt and selfish, using royal privileges for his self-serving purposes that led to his people impeaching him.
Relationships

Marshall D. Teach
[
]
Pizarro is threatened by Teach.
Marshall D. Teach
is the one who freed Pizzaro from
Impel Down
after he earned a place in the crew through a battle royal and was likely very grateful. Pizzaro once jokingly suggested himself usurping Teach but has since been dissuaded from that idea. Pizzaro seems to fear Teach's wrath as he knew how upset his captain would be if too much damage happened to
Hachinosu
on his watch, which was proven to be the case later, when Teach personally threatened him for his failure.
Pizarro has expressed a degree of annoyance that Teach always makes headlines for his actions, wanting to also make a name for himself in the news and gain recognition as a powerful pirate.
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
Pizzaro hates
Garp
for all the commotion he caused with
SWORD
during the mission to rescue
Koby
from Hachinosu. Pizzaro decided to destroy Garp's ship and everyone on it in order to crush the old marine's spirit only for Garp along with Koby to seriously injure him. After Garp distracted the Blackbeard Pirates so Koby and the others could escape he became extremally frustrated.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Pizarro's abilities have not yet been fully defined, but he was powerful enough to be contained in Level 6 of Impel Down when caught by the
World Government
. Another testament to his power is the fact that, when Blackbeard recruited the Level 6 prisoners, he only chose the ones that could survive when pitted against everyone else in a free-for-all battle. Thus, Pizarro is one of the strongest Level 6 prisoners.
As a king of a
North Blue
country, he had authority over his people, though his abuse of it led to them overthrowing him, stripping him of such privileges. After becoming captain of the Fourth Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates, he gained the authority associated with the status.
Physical Abilities
[
]
Pizarro has superhuman durability, as seen when he took a direct hit from a
Gura Gura no Mi
strike from former
Emperor
Edward Newgate
, having taken a direct hit from
Sengoku
's shock wave bursts in
Daibutsu form
and remaining mostly untroubled by the attack.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Shima Shima no Mi
Pizarro merged with
Hachinosu
.
Pizarro ate the Shima Shima no Mi, a
Paramecia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to assimilate his body into an island itself. Once assimilated, he can control both the natural environment and any artificial structures.
While merged with an island, he can feel human activity on it, as if something were tickling a corresponding part of his body. As such, he used his abilities to act as surveillance system for
Hachinosu
, detecting and responding to any enemy activity on the island.
He can also make his face manifest across the island, in sizes and on surfaces of his choosing.
Weapons
[
]
In the manga he used unknown weapons, due to his arms being always obscured by something. In the anime, he was seen wielding flintlocks against Whitebeard.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Avalo Pizarro once ruled over his own kingdom in the
North Blue
, but he used his power to fulfill his own goals and was consequently overthrown by his people.

World Government
and sentenced to life in
Impel Down
Level 6, where he was effectively erased from history.

The Blackbeard Pirates used Teach's knowledge of Whitebeard's former territory to conquer it. Now that Blackbeard has become an
Emperor

Kuzan
and after a brief skirmish they all started drinking, laugh and having a good time. After Kuzan overhead Laffitte whispering the question if they should kill Kuzan for the
Hie Hie no Mi

]
Garp punches the island head of Pizarro.
Days after the meeting, Koby had managed to escape with the help of Perona. Using his
Devil Fruit ability
, Avalo Pizarro managed to pinpoint the breakout and inform the Blackbeard Pirates to capture Koby, although alive. He was then questioned by
Shiryu
why he did not engage himself, only replying Teach would not like him doing that. He then scolded
Vasco Shot
for bringing up the idea of setting the town on fire which would make Teach even more furious and then brushed off the idea of sending
Sanjuan Wolf
, replying to the Rocky Port had just been repaired.
However, when Garp and SWORD later wreaked havoc on the island, they were able to send off all prisoners and Marines off the island. Pizarro, seeing their ship using his powers, pointed out his disappointment and annoyance with Teach always getting the praise from the news for his actions. Sensing a chance, Pizarro attempted to crush the ship with his Devil Fruit powers by forming gigantic hands from the island while dubbing the upcoming news report as Garp's failed rescue attempt of Koby and their demise by Pizarro's hands.
However, he was interrupted by Garp strike the Stone Skull greatly hurting Pizarro. Pizzaro pulled himself together and continued his attack when Koby went in front of the hand. Pizarro laughed and said that being called a hero must have gone to Koby's head, but to his and everyone else's shock Koby destroyed the massive stone appendage which inflicted even more pain to Pizzaro.

Luckily for him, Teach calmed down on his own, happy to learn that they had gained Garp in exchange, essentially giving them an even greater token to play later. Not long after, Devon and Augur arrived back with

, leading to Pizarro using his control of the island to dock their ship.
