giant
warrior described as being from the "new generation" of
Elbaph
.
He is the son of the late
King
Harald
and the older brother of
prince
Loki
.
A century after the
Giant Warrior Pirates
' disbandment, Hajrudin formed the
New Giant Warrior Pirates
in an attempt to revive the legendary crew;
they formerly served as S-class
pirate
mercenaries
for
Buggy
's
Pirate Dispatch Organization
.
Hajrudin competed in the
Corrida Colosseum
on
Dressrosa
, where he would team up with
Monkey D. Luffy
and the
Straw Hat Pirates
to overthrow
Donquixote Doflamingo
's regime. Following this, Hajrudin swore his crew's allegiance to Luffy and became the captain of the sixth ship of the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
.
He is a major ally during the
Dressrosa Arc
, and one of the central characters of
The Stories of the Self-Proclaimed Straw Hat Grand Fleet
Cover Page Serial.
Appearance
[
]
Hajrudin is a muscular giant, well proportioned, and has long dark brown hair, mustache, and beard. He wears a metal helmet (gold in the manga) with protector shades over his eyes.
He sports large metal
vambraces
(gold in the manga) with shields on each one. He also wears a pair of black underwear covered by a
pteruges
skirt of brown leather strips. He also has a gold belt buckle, and sports big black boots.
After leaving Buggy's Delivery, Hajrudin wears armor plates over his belt and below his chest, a thick fur cape, and bigger vambraces.
When he was a child, Hajrudin was stocky, and wore striped pants held up by suspenders, as well as a large dark belt lined with fur. He also wore a warrior's helmet and carried a sword that was taller than him.
After he was turned into a toy, he became an elephant and wore a black cap.
Personality
[
]
He is an arrogant individual, bragging that if he wins the competition and acquires the
Mera Mera no Mi
, he will become the
king
of the
giants
.
However, Hajrudin is also a very honorable and prideful person, as befitting a warrior of
Elbaph
. He held
Usopp
in the air so everyone could see the man who saved him and the others, and proclaimed he would follow Usopp out of gratitude. In addition, upon meeting
Luffy
outside the
colosseum
, he told him that he would put aside his defeat and kill
Donquixote Doflamingo
to repay his debt to him. He would later decide to pledge his loyalty to Luffy and become a part of the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
for the same reasons. He even cut all ties to
Buggy's Delivery
and quit his job as a pirate mercenary, leaving in order to honor his new allegiance to Luffy and the
Straw Hats
. His honor and pride as a warrior is great, as despite his many injuries during his battle against
Machvise
, he was determined to repay his debt to his saviors, and continued his battle against Machvise, sustaining even more serious injuries in order to finally defeat him. His subordinate,
Road
, saw Hajrudin's choice to follow Luffy (a normal-sized human) as disgraceful, but Hajrudin was adamant when Road brought it up.
His honor and pride also seems to extend to his
race
as well, as he wants to plan and lead the revival of the currently disbanded
Giant Warrior Pirates
, an infamous crew that had been disbanded for a hundred years, and has already succeeded in recruiting four giants in pursuit of achieving this goal. He has been working toward this ever since he was young, being shown training hard at the age of 18.
Like many people, Hajrudin has a unique laugh: "Digagagaga".
Relationships
[
]
Allies
[
]
Elbaph Giants
[
]
Hajrudin deeply respects Elbaph's traditions. He had a good relationship with his teacher,
Raideen
, who trained Hajrudin when he was very young. He also has great admiration for
Jorul
and
Jarul
and was infuriated when Jorul died as a result of
Charlotte Linlin
's actions.
Straw Hat Pirates
[
]
Hajrudin was initially hostile towards
Luffy
due to being opponents at the
Corrida Colosseum
tournament. However, after his transformation into a
toy
, Hajrudin witnessed
Usopp
fighting
Trebol
and
Sugar
and promised to work for him if he managed to succeed.
After he was freed from Sugar's
toy curse
by Usopp, Hajrudin kept his word and picked Usopp up and expressed his gratitude towards the Straw Hats'
sniper
before showing him to the other freed slaves to acknowledge him as their savior.
He then decided to repay his debt towards Usopp by allying with Luffy, telling him that he would forget his earlier defeat at the Colosseum to aid him in the decisive battle against the
Donquixote Pirates
. He was intent on repaying his saviors by stopping
Machvise
from attacking
Zoro
and sent the Donquixote officer flying as Zoro thanked him for his actions.
After
Doflamingo
's downfall, Hajrudin decided, along with his allies, for his crew to travel under the
Straw Hat Pirates
' flag as the sixth ship of the
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
.
Enemies
[
]
Charlotte Linlin
[
]
Hajrudin had known the
Emperor
when he was only 18 years old and just like the other giants, he had come to hate Linlin for devastating an Elbaph village and fatally injuring Jorul, one of the giants' greatest heroes. He even urged Jarul to kill Linlin, saying that it was for Elbaph's pride.
Donquixote Pirates
[
]
After he was defeated at the Corrida Colosseum tournament, Hajrudin was turned into a toy and enslaved by Doflamingo's crew. After Sugar's curse broke, Hajrudin chose to ally with Doflamingo's enemies and helped ensure the downfall of the Donquixote Pirates by defeating one of their officers, Machvise.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As
captain
of the
New Giant Warrior Pirates
, he has complete authority over his crew.
As
prince
of
Elbaph
, he holds significant authority and influence over the warriors and citizens of Elbaph, which is said to be the strongest kingdom in the entire
world
.
His strength appears to be fairly well-known,
and he was formerly an S Class member in
Buggy
's
Pirate Dispatch Organization
, indicating that Buggy himself recognized Hajrudin as one of the best men in the organization.
According to
Gatz
, he has been considered the strongest
mercenary
pirate
.
He was also able to face
Machvise
, an
officer
of the
Donquixote Pirates
, and after much effort he was able to defeat him.
Physical Abilities
[
]
As a
giant
from Elbaph, he has incredible strength.
His punches were described as "bolts of thunder", allowing him to overpower several powerful gladiators and crush
Ucy
.
He has immense pain tolerance, able to withstand tremendous physical strain that nearly cost him an arm as well as taking the breaking of his right leg from the brutal force of
Machvise
's
Jigoku no Manton Vise
head on through sheer will and even managed to muster enough physical power to counter and overpower Machvise's attack, sending the officer flying straight into
Doflamingo
's
Torikage
, incapacitating the former in the process.
Weapons
[
]
Hajrudin wears giant
gauntlets
, which he uses to hammer his fists down onto his enemies. He also wields a huge
spiked club
and seems to be quite proficient at using it, swatting a group of
bounty hunters
aside. When he was younger, he wielded a large
broadsword
. When he became captain of the New Giant Warrior Pirates, Hajrudin was seen holding a massive
broadaxe
.
Techniques
[
]
Hajrudin uses Gungnir against Machvise.
Gungnir
(
英雄の槍
,
Gunguniru
?
, literally meaning "Hero's Spear")
: Hajrudin performs an uppercut with tremendous force, capable of sending someone flying a great distance. He first used this technique to defeat Machvise's Jigoku no Manton Vise, cracking his shield in half and sending the Super-Weight Human flying, though the strain caused the performing right arm and the supporting right leg's bones to shatter.
Gungnir
is the spear wielded by the Norse god, Odin.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
Hajrudin was born on
Elbaph
81 years ago as a son of King
Harald
.
When he was 18 years old, Hajrudin was seen training at Elbaph before the
Winter Solstice Festival
. After a sparring match with
Raideen
, Hajrudin greeted
Jorul
and
Jarul
when they arrived at the village to invite the children to feast on
semla
prior to the 12-day fast.
On the seventh day of the fast, an incident occurred where
Charlotte Linlin
devastated an Elbaph village due to her craving sickness and fatally injured Jorul. After the
giants
calmed Linlin down by giving her semla, Hajrudin was enraged at Linlin's actions and urged Jarul to kill her as
Carmel
pleaded the elder giant to spare her, which caused Hajrudin to be more enraged.
Some giants salvage the books from Ohara.
22 years ago, Hajrudin,
Gerd
, and
Goldberg
traveled to
Ohara
a few months after its
destruction
and salvaged the books that had been thrown into the lake. Afterward, they transported the books to Elbaph.
During the Timeskip
[
]
Later in his life, he and
four other giants
had begun a plan to recruit more giants and revive the formerly infamous giant pirate crew, known as the Giant Warrior Pirates, with Hajrudin leading this new crew. As a result of this pursuit, Hajrudin had gained great fame as one of the "new generation" of pirates.
At some point, Hajrudin and his crew joined
Buggy
's
Pirate Dispatch Organization
where he became an S-class pirate mercenary.
Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Luffy defeats Hajrudin with a single punch.
Hajrudin entered the
Corrida Colosseum
to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
. He was seen by
Vice Admiral
Maynard
and his name was given to an officer outside the Colosseum who was writing names down.
For the battle royale, he was placed in C Block.
He stood strong in the middle of the battlefield and eliminated any contestant that crossed his path until
Lucy
and
Ucy
ran into him. He tried to eliminate both of them with one smash of his shield and successfully defeated Ucy. But as he walked away, Lucy stood up and avenged Ucy, eliminating Hajrudin from the competition with a single punch.
As the crowd was shocked at Hajrudin's swift defeat and cheered Lucy on, Hajrudin's unconscious body was unceremoniously punched aside by
Ideo
to clear the ring.
Hajrudin holds up Usopp in praise before the former toys.
Sometime later, Hajrudin was supposed to receive treatment for his injuries but instead was thrown into an underground dungeon filled with broken
toys
and some of the other disqualified participants. Once
Sai
joined them and demanded an explanation, Hajrudin commented that the losers were being dumped into the dungeon for some reason.
Soon afterwards, he listened as Ricky revealed himself to be the former king of
Dressrosa
,
Riku Doldo III
.
Hajrudin was later
transformed
into a toy and put to work in the underground trade port. While witnessing
Usopp
's confrontation with
Trébol
and
Sugar
, he silently begged Usopp to succeed, saying that he will even work for him.
When Sugar lost consciousness, Hajrudin transformed back into his original form.
He later blocked Trébol, who was attacking
Robin
, and then picked up Usopp and held him high for all the freed toys to see, declaring him as their savior.
After Doflamingo trapped Dressrosa in his "Birdcage", Hajrudin and the other colosseum fighters escaped to the surface through an opening created by
Pica
when he rearranged the land with his
ability
.
Hajrudin with Luffy, Zoro, Law, Ucy and the other Corrida Colosseum combatants are on their way for Doflamingo.
When he found Luffy,
Zoro
, and
Law
, Hajrudin stated that he will forget about his fight with Luffy at the colosseum and repay his debt to Usopp by defeating
Doflamingo
. Therefore, he joined forces with Luffy's group alongside the
Chinjao Family
,
Suleiman
, Ideo, Ucy,
Blue Gilly
,
Cavendish
,
Abdullah
,
Jeet
,
Orlumbus
,
Elizabello II
, and
Dagama
. When some of the former toys came for the heads of Luffy, Zoro, and Law, Hajrudin and the allied colosseum fighters fought them off. They later march towards the royal palace and battle against Pica.
When Pica attacked, Chinjao and Elizabello II shattered his stone hand, enabling the group to move forward.
Hajrudin and the other allied fighters fought through Doflamingo's troops. Pica then attacked with his other arm, causing Hajrudin and some of the other allies to fall back. After avoiding Pica's strike, they were surprised to see Luffy, Zoro, Law, Abdullah, Jeet, and Ucy climbing on Pica's arm. They were also amazed when Luffy shattered Pica's stone head. When Pica's giant stone body stopped moving, Hajrudin and his allies continued on with their assault.
With Zoro fighting Pica and Sabo fighting the
Marines
, the Colosseum fighters charged up the new King's Plateau and easily defeated the
Donquixote Pirates
' troops standing in their way. They later reached the first level and got ahead of Luffy.
Hajrudin defeats Machvise.
After reaching the second level, the Colosseum fighters were confronted by four of the Donquixote Pirate officers. The Colosseum fighters later banded together to create an opening for Luffy and Cavendish.
Later on, Hajrudin faced off against
Machvise
.
The officer later used his 10 Ton Vise attack to bring down the giant.
Zoro passed by where the giant fell and Machvise turned his attention to the swordsman. Resolving to repay his saviors, Hajrudin arose and launched a powerful punch called "Gungnir" against Machvise's Jigoku no Manton Vise. After a brief struggle, Hajrudin successfully sent the officer flying into the ceiling of the birdcage, defeating him. Hajrudin then passed out from his injuries and Zoro promised him that when the giant wakes up, the birdcage will be brought down.
After most of the Donquixote Pirates' officers were defeated, Pica preyed on the injured, including Hajrudin.
Hajrudin and the other gladiators defeat the remaining Donquixote Pirates.
During the final phase of Doflamingo's game, Hajrudin and the other injured gladiators were temporarily
healed
by
Mansherry
. They then defeated the remaining Donquixote Pirates on the New King's Plateau to help the citizens flee from the shrinking Birdcage.
When the Birdcage came close to the central streets, the gladiators worked together to push back the Birdcage via
Bartolomeo
's
barrier
.
Eventually, the effects of Mansherry's healing powers began to wear off and Hajrudin collapsed.
Later that night after the aftermath, Hajrudin and the other gladiators rested at the palace.
Three days after Doflamingo's defeat, Hajrudin and the other gladiators prepared to assist the Straw Hats' escape from Dressrosa when the Marines were mobilized to pursue them.
As the Straw Hats made their way to the eastern port, Hajrudin and his fellow gladiators stood in the way of the Marines that were chasing after them.
The fighters later gathered at the eastern port, preparing to fight
Issho
. When Issho prepared to attack them with all the rubble from Dressrosa, the fighters and the Straw Hats quickly fled to the escape ship. At that moment, Luffy arrived and attacked Issho.
During the clash, Issho used his gravity ability to blow away Luffy, who was then caught by Hajrudin. The fighters and Straw Hats quickly fled across a bridge leading to a gigantic ship in the distance. Issho prepared to drop the rubble on them but was obstructed by the Dressrosa citizens who were pretending to chase after Luffy. They eventually reached Orlumbus' flagship, the
Yonta Maria
. After boarding the ship, Hajrudin's crew was then one of the seven groups that pledged their allegiance to the Straw Hats.
The Straw Hat Grand Fleet celebrates their victory
When Luffy was asked to perform a
sakazuki ceremony
to complete the agreement for an alliance, Luffy declined, much to the others' shock. Once Luffy explained that they can do whatever they want, the allies decided to forge the alliance anyway, forming the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. Sai, Bartolomeo, Leo, Cavendish, Ideo, Orlumbus, and Hajrudin sat down and drank their sake cups. Afterwards, they held a feast to celebrate their victory over Doflamingo.
After the feast, Hajrudin and the other leading allies received Luffy's
Vivre Card
and parted ways.

Loki

After hearing that the Straw Hats would be arriving at Elbaph, Hajrudin and Stansen went down to Elbaph's Underworld and hunted down a giant moose so they could serve the meat to the Straw Hats. Since their Painter would not work while it is snowing, they had to carry the moose's body over their heads.
