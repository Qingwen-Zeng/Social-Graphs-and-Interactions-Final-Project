are two infamous

Appearance
[
]
The Decalvan Brothers appear to be twins (since they share the same birthday), and both wear overalls. Both have wide faces (though one of them is wider than the other) and flowing black hair. The one with the wider face has sharper teeth. Each brother opens one of their eyes which is large and black around the rim, and closes the other which has a scar over it; which eye they open and close are opposite to one another.
They both wear a brown and yellow pirate tricorn hat with polka dots bandanna underneath it (one red, and one blue). The hat bears their
Jolly Roger
: two skulls and a cross-bone, with a wavy design over it. They both wear yellow long gloves with razor-sharp nails at the end on both hands.
Personalities
[
]
Not much is known about the Decalvan Brother's personality, other than that they were willing to fight in order to rescue Ace from execution instead of fleeing through the path he had cleared with his
power
.
After learning of the dirty trick orchestrated by the Marines, the brothers were outraged of such action.
Abilities and Powers

]
The Decalvan Brothers have managed to make themselves an infamous reputation in the
New World
, becoming subordinates of the
Whitebeard Pirates

.
In the anime, they were able to fight on par with

Weapons
[
]
They wear gloves with razor-sharp nails at the end, which are most likely used in battle, similar to

History
[
]
Some time prior to the current storyline, the Decalvan brothers had become a known pirates in the New World, and they and their crew became subordinates of the Whitebeard Pirates.

Marineford Arc
[
]
The Decalvan Brothers and other New World captains support Luffy and Ivankov.
The Decalvan Brothers and their crew, along with a fleet of 42 other infamous
pirate
crews subordinate to the
Whitebeard Pirates
, sailed to
Marineford
in order to save
Portgas D. Ace
from his execution. After failing to reach
Squard
,
Whitebeard
contacted the Decalvan Brothers and gave them, along with certain other captains, the command of all the
New World
pirates in retaliation to Ace's early execution time.
After Whitebeard was stabbed by Squard and forgave him, the Decalvan Brothers commented on how ashamed Squard must be feeling for falling for the Marines' trick.
They later joined the group of New World captains who were backing up
Monkey D. Luffy
and
Emporio Ivankov
on Whitebeard's orders.
When the
Blackbeard Pirates
launched a barrage of bullets and blades at Whitebeard, killing him in the process, the Decalvan Brothers cried. Upon the arrival of
Shanks
and
Sengoku
calling the war coming to a close, they and the rest of Whitebeard's crew and allies left.
The following events are

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
In the anime, an additional flashback scene was shown in which the Decalvan Brothers fought against
Thatch
and were beginning to overpower him before Ace joined the fight. The outcome remains unknown, but it is very likely that the brothers were overpowered by the two commanders, since it was stated that the bounty of
Portgas D. Ace
rose again after the battle.
Decalvan Brothers vs. Dalmatian.
In the manga, they were always standing together, with one brother partly covering the other one, resembling conjoined twins. In the anime, there were some scenes where they stood further away from each other.
Furthermore, they were given an additional scene of fighting against
Vice Admiral
Dalmatian
when Whitebeard ordered his subordinates to backup Luffy.
This was not shown in the manga.
In the manga version of Whitebeard and Ace's funeral in
Chapter 590
, the Decalvan Brothers cannot be seen among those in attendance. However, the anime version of the exact same scene in
Episode 505
explicitly shows the Decalvan Brothers alongside the other attendees.
Although it can be assumed that the Decalvan Brothers were at the funeral, there is no visual evidence of their attendance in the manga to support this assumption and, as such, their attendance can only be considered non-canon.
In the anime, one of the brother's lower half of the face can be identified among the news reports of those defeated by
Edward Weevil
, alongside the reports of
Elmy
,
Ramba
,
Whitey Bay
,
Bizarre
,
A O
, and
Palms
.
