Appearance
[
]
Devon is an extremely tall, pale-skinned, and slightly well-endowed woman (shown to stand a similar height to her captain, who is 344 cm) with her hair in a set of girlish pigtails. Her face has wrinkles, a sloping forehead, a long witch-like nose, a devilish grin, and a square jaw.
Before the timeskip, she wore a striped Impel Down uniform with a V-neckline. She also wore a large magenta cape, a blue pearl necklace, and a purple sash around her waist over lavender cargo-pants and black shoes.
After the timeskip, Devon's hair is much longer. She now sports a new outfit that makes her resemble more a classical pirate. She wears a bicorn hat decorated with a single rose and feathers on one side and a plume on the other, as well as the Blackbeard Pirates'
Jolly Roger
printed on the front, a corset that is longer on the back and extends all the way down to her knee area, a striped dress shirt, a cravat and heels that are slightly different from her previous ones. Her pants now have a pair of belts closing its hems. She also carries a sword on her right hip.
Personality
[
]
Devon seems loyal to Blackbeard after he freed her from Impel Down. Saint
Jaygarcia Saturn
noted that she's unlikely to subordinate herself to someone else, which Devon confirmed, however she claimed that Teach is special.
When the Marines recognized her for the first time, she mentioned that she "likes them too" which suggests that she is a somewhat sarcastic person.
She also preferred to receive new clothes in exchange of the prisoners' uniform that she dislikes wearing. She is obsessed with collecting beautiful women's heads,
such as when she declared that she admired the beauty of
Boa Hancock
and that her head would make a "wonderful trophy". Devon seems to have a romantic preference for women, as she is seen surrounding herself with adoring female admirers on
Hachinosu
, and was also affected by Boa Hancock's
Devil Fruit ability
.
She has a sadistic side, as seen when she mocked
Gecko Moria
over the death of his subordinate
Absalom
, whom she masqueraded as to give Moria a false sense of hope.
Like other characters in One Piece, she has a
distinct laughter
: "Murunfuffuffu"
(
ムルンフッフッフッ
?
, VIZ: "Murun hu hu hu")
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Over the two-year timeskip, Catarina Devon has become promoted to the Captain of the Sixth Ship serves as a testament of Teach's trust in her powers, along with granting her the authority over the lower-ranking members.
Catarina Devon is one of the most powerful female pirates to have ever lived and when she was imprisoned in
Impel Down
, she was placed in level 6 where only the worst criminals in the world are locked up.
Another testament to her power is the fact that when Blackbeard recruited the Level 6 prisoners, he only chose the strongest ones that could survive when pitted against everyone else in a free-for-all battle. Thus, Catarina Devon is one of the strongest Level 6 prisoners.

sailed to Egghead.
During the

Jaygarcia Saturn
, who had been punched away by Luffy. Devon remarked on Saturn's power and that one of the
Five Elders
would make their way down to the surface. She then touched Saturn's leg, noting that their mission was complete. When Saturn questioned why she would subject herself to working under another, Devon proudly stated that Blackbeard was special. Saturn added on that Blackbeard's heritage was as well, surprising her at his knowledge. Saturn then demanded to know what the two of them were doing on Egghead, to which Augur boldly stated that their overall goal was the
world
itself, prompting Saturn to attack them. However, Augur
teleported
them away to another area of Egghead. When Devon asked why he had not teleported them further away, Augur stated that he had not yet mastered his ability. To Augur and Devon's bewilderment, an ecstatic
Caribou
approached the two, declaring himself a huge fan of the Blackbeard Pirates, and begged to be taken to see Blackbeard himself.
Augur confirmed to Devon who Caribou was but was distrustful and kept his rifle pointed at the pirate, though Caribou pleaded with the two take him to see Teach as he had valuable information on the locations of the
Ancient
Weapons
he would provide to the Emperor free of charge.
In the end, Augur and Devon decided to take Caribou with them, eventually making it back to their ship. Devon made a call to Blackbeard, asking for his opinion and suggesting simply killing Caribou. Caribou begged for a chance to share his information, which piqued Blackbeard's interest enough for him to allow a meeting, but also stated that he would kill Caribou should the knowledge not be useful.

Early Concepts

Early concepts of a potential Blackbeard Pirates member.
In
One Piece Green: Secret Pieces
, concept art of a young swordswoman in
Wano Country
-esque clothes, originally intended for the
Blackbeard Pirates
, was shown. She was ultimately scrapped, being replaced by Devon as the sole female member of the crew.
In an
SBS
,
Oda
stated that he took out the beauty because the Blackbeard Pirates have a "more pirate-like" theme: huge, rough, and vulgar. A beauty would just ruin the mood if she existed (although Oda also stated that he likes doing such things).
