Appearance
[
]
Bobby Funk is a large, muscular man, who looms over his older brother
Kelly
. He has dark hair in two tails slung over his left shoulder. His long dark beard is also kept in two tails. He has a swirling lightning tattoo down his neck and right shoulder. He wears and a broad-rimmed fedora, a dred tie, and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up.
Personality
[
]
Bobby Funk appears to have a sense of honor and pride as he was seen scolding
Dagama
for scheming with and bribing the other competitors, although Dagama implied that they might have also bribed their way into the same block as well. He has also shown love for his country.
Bobby maintains a level head in combat, but does not appear to fight and when confronted by a
warrior
turned his back and pleaded, stating he has never fought in his life. His main interest appears to be restraining his older brother, although he has an absent-minded habit of restraining the person Kelly is fighting instead.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
He is a skilled assassin, so it can be assumed that he has some skill in fighting and assassination.
He is allegedly strong enough to take down pirates worth over
100 million. According to his brother Kelly, Bobby was blessed with an extremely strong body from birth (strong enough that being struck by a
Armament Haki
-infused axe not only did not hurt him, but also broke the axe), but his weak will and lack of fighting spirit prevents him from using it effectively. Thus, he usually
wears
his brother Kelly, allowing his bloodthirsty brother to make better use of his body.

Dressrosa Saga

Dressrosa Arc
[
]
Bobby and Kelly came to the
Corrida Colosseum
to compete for the
Mera Mera no Mi
, in order to help their country.
They were placed in C Block.
After
Lucy
defeated
Spartan
, Bobby and Kelly were arguing with
Dagama
. Kelly demanded that the
Prodence Kingdom
tactician stop conspiring with the strong competitors in his block, with Bobby commenting that a fight is a personal thing. In full agreement with his brother, Kelly commented on how Dagama was using conspiracy and bribery to get his way. However, the tactician was not phased with the brothers' threats, and stated that they must have been sent from their own country in order to get the
Devil Fruit
for "war and diplomatic relations", before pointing out the other big name competitors fighting for the same prize. When Dagama accused the two brothers of scheming just as much as everyone else present, and asked them if they used bribes in order to get into the same block as each other, Bobby simply commented that it was a coincidence.
As C Block began, Bobby and his brother prepared to fight.
Later, Kelly mercilessly beat a fighter who was already unconscious. Alarmed, Bobby pleaded for his brother to stop, but ended up accidentally grabbing his brother's opponent instead of him. After realizing his mistake, Bobby finally restrained his violent brother, who told him that the guy he had been pounding had called him a midget. When Kelly asked if he truly was a midget, Bobby assured him he was not, but his message seemed lost on Kelly, who once again started beating the unfortunate fighter. Not surprisingly, Bobby again grabbed the wrong person in a second attempt to restrain his brother. His anger finally sated, Kelly finished his brutal beat down by threatening to gouge the man's eyes out. He then angrily told his brother to stop blocking him, with Bobby meekly informing his brother that this was a match.
Bobby and his brother defeat Boo.
Moments later,
Boo
came up on them, curious to see how a boxer with no formal training would fair against him. He immediately sent Kelly flying with a quick jab to the chin. Alarmed, Bobby cried out in concern for his brother. Boo then turned his sights on him, and told him to prepare himself. Bobby, panicking in the face of this new threat, claimed he had never been in a fight, and then cowered over his brother, exposing his back to Boo, who immediately took the opportunity to swing one of his axes down on him. Much to Boo's surprise, however, his axe snapped over Bobby's back. This seemingly impossible feat was made even more surprising by the fact that Boo had imbued
Armament Haki
into that last attack, leading the man to question how strong Bobby's body was. As Bobby fretted over his brother, Kelly angrily muttered how Boo had called him a midget and told Bobby to "put it on".
Thanks to Kelly's
Jake Jake no Mi
, his body unzipped and deflated like a jacket so that Bobby could then don him and Kelly could borrow Bobby's body and strength.
Kelly then hit Boo with a barrage of punches that knocked him unconscious. Unsatisfied with this, Kelly continued to pummel the kenpo user into the ground, threatening to bite his throat out.
The Funk Brothers are defeated by Sai.
Kelly, in Bobby's body, then proceeded to rampage through several more fighters with his Rarara Rambo, before being confronted by
Sai
. Despite the size and strength he had gained from Bobby, Kelly was defeated when Sai demonstrated his own speed and strength by climbing into the air atop Kelly's flying fists and delivering a
Hasshoken
-infused kick to his head, knocking the brothers out instantly.
Sometime after C Block, Bobby and Kelly Funk were
transformed into toys
and forced to work in the underground trade port. When
Sugar
passed out, they returned to their human forms, and Bobby held someone for Kelly to pummel.
The former
toys
hailed
Usopp
as their savior.
While Kelly fused with Bobby, they appeared at the first level of the new King's Plateau seemingly to aid Luffy and his allies.
The Funk Brothers, however, lied about the tunnel, which lead to a dead end.
Donquixote Doflamingo
appeared at the entrance, incapacitated the Funk Brothers, and entered.
