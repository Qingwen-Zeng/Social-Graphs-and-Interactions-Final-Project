Napoleon the Bicorne
is a
homie
taking the form of a
bicorne
hat that is worn by
Big Mom
.
He can also become a sword homie that Big Mom uses in combat.
He is a special kind of homie, as he received a
soul fragment
from Big Mom herself,
and serves as one of her personal weapons alongside
Prometheus
and
Hera
, and formerly
Zeus
.
Appearance
[
]
Napoleon is an extremely large pink bicorne hat with a
Jolly Roger
on the front; the Jolly Roger consists of a skull with yellow eyes, two crossed knives, and a curled white mustache. He emotes through the skull of the Jolly Roger, seeing with its eyes and talking with its mouth. Napoleon also has a yellow stripe around his top, and a fastener on his left side.
Napoleon also can turn into a form of a giant blade with insane-looking eyes and a wicked sharp-toothed grin on the sharp edge.
20 years before the current timeline, Napoleon had a crack on his right forehead.
Personality
[
]
Napoleon is often seen making the same expressions as Big Mom, and usually keeps a straight face otherwise.
He is very loyal to Big Mom, as shown when he instantly went to attack a disturbance in Big Mom's room along with Zeus and Prometheus.
He cares about Sweet City and its well-being, as he tried to stop Big Mom from destroying it in one of her craving-induced rampages.
When in his blade form, Napoleon displays a more aggressive personality, threatening to bisect Jinbe and encouraging Big Mom's rampage.
As with Prometheus, Napoleon sees
Zeus
being a liability to the crew for his constant failures and setbacks, and showed no regret at Zeus being disposed of by Linlin and Hera.
However, without Big Mom, Napoleon displays a far meeker personality. While Big Mom was amnesiac, he remained quiet, only reawakening when Big Mom regained her memories, saying that the reason he did not say anything up to that point was because he was shy around strangers.
Similarly, when he was attacked and separated from Big Mom by
Killer
, Napoleon fearfully pleaded to be left alone, claiming to just be "a regular sword".
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being made from a fragment of
Big Mom
's very own soul, Napoleon is far more powerful than regular
homies
. This gives the bicorne a will strong enough to resist the soul projection of the
Yomi Yomi no Mi
's user.
He is also capable of receiving telepathic signals from other homies and relaying the received information back to Big Mom.
Bladed Forms
[
]
Napoleon can take the form of a sword, with the handle at his bottom and the blade at his top, which allows him to attack on his own or be grabbed and wielded by Big Mom. He can also transfer his soul into his blade, becoming a sword homie. When doing this, Napoleon can freely manipulate the shape of the sword, extending the blade at will
or turning into different kinds of blades, including a
cutlass
,
longsword
,
a
seax
with a serrated tip,
and a
gladius
.
The blades he turns into are extremely powerful, capable of clashing equally with
Kaidou
's
kanabo
without sustaining any damage.

Techniques
[
]
Big Mom using "Ikoku" against Kingbaum.
Ikoku
(
威国
,
Ikoku
?
, literally meaning "Mighty Nation")
: Big Mom swings Napoleon in his longsword form with such force that she creates a shockwave that destroys everything in its path, enough to pierce through a large part of
Whole Cake Island
. The speed and range of this attack is such that
Kingbaum
, a noted fast runner, could not completely avoid it in time, losing about a third of his face to the wave. Befitting its description as "
Spear of Elbaf
"
(
エルバフの槍
,
Erubafu no Yari
?
)
, and as noted by
Luffy
, it is very similar to
Dorry
and
Brogy
's combination attack,
Hakoku
.
In the VIZ manga and Funimation subs, it is called
Ikoku Sovereignty
. The Funimation dub retains the original name.
Cognac
(
皇帝剣
,
Konyakku
?
, literally meaning "Emperor Blade")
: Napoleon turns into his seax form, and Big Mom sets his blade alight with
Prometheus
's flames, resulting in a weapon that both cuts and burns the opponent. This is apparently Napoleon's most powerful form, as Big Mom's children were surprised that
Jinbe
was able to block it, even if only for a few moments. Napoleon can also stretch the blade to increase its range, at least to the entire length of the
Thousand Sunny
.
Cognac
is a type of liquor that is typically used to
flambé
food by creating a burst of flames, referencing how Napoleon's blade is similarly set alight by Prometheus' flames.
Hahaba
(
破々刃
,
Hahaba
?
, literally meaning "Blade of Destructions")
: With Cognac activated, Big Mom swings Napoleon horizontally at her opponent. This attack has a tremendous amount of power, sending
Jinbe
flying a great distance away despite him trying to block it with Haki.
The pun of this attack name is that its pronunciation is the same as
haha
(母) and
ba
(婆), Japanese for "mother" and "grandmother" respectively, referencing Big Mom's many children and grandchildren. This is called
Mama-Mash
in the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations.
Haha no Hi
(
刃母の炎
,
Haha no Hi
?
, literally meaning "Blade Mother's Blaze")
: With Cognac activated, Big Mom swings Napoleon down vertically at her foe, with the impact creating a fiery explosion.
The attack name is a pun on "Mother's Day"
(
母の日
,
Haha no Hi
?
)
. This is called
Happy Mother's Blaze
in the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations.
Big Mom and Kaidou using Hakai on the Worst Generation.
Hakai
(
覇海
,
Hakai
?
, literally meaning "Supremacy Sea")
: A combined attack by Big Mom and
Kaidou
. Standing side to side, Big Mom swings Napoleon in its Cognac form, while simultaneously Kaidou in his
Human-Beast form
swings his kanabo
Hassaikai
. The combined power of the Emperor's strikes create a powerful explosion-like shock wave of force that quickly travels forward and absolutely devastates anything in its wake; the attack was shown to dwarf the island of
Onigashima
, and
Roronoa Zoro
was heavily injured even by just attempting to block the attack for a moment. Like
Ikoku
, this move is very similar to Dorry and Brogy's combined
Hakoku
technique, featuring even the same poses.
In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Conquest of the Sea
.
Maser Ho
(
鳴光砲
,
Mēzā Hō
?
, literally meaning "Roaring Light Cannon")
: A combined attack with his fellow special homies Prometheus and Hera. The three homies assemble together, with Napoleon's gladius blade piercing through Prometheus at its base and Hera at its tip, and Prometheus and Hera combining their energies, forming several tendrils of lightning and fire that create a large circular ring in between them. Then, by swinging Napoleon, Big Mom unleashes the energies in the form of a thin, highly concentrated beam that can pierce through flesh in an instant and culminates in a large explosion. It was first used against
Ulti
, easily piercing through her
tough scaly skin
and immediately knocking her unconscious despite her superhuman durability.
A
maser
is a device that produces coherent electromagnetic waves, especially microwaves, through amplification by stimulated emission. The technique's name may also be a reference to the
Maser Cannon
, a fictional weapon in the
Godzilla
film franchise. In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Maser Cannon
.
Marma-Raid
(
マーマ
急襲
,
Māmareido
?
)
: Big Mom infuses Napoleon with Hera and jumps in the air, spinning forward vertically while holding the blade before striking the target downward with a lightning-powered slash. This was first used against
Eustass Kid
.
The name of the attack seems to be a pun on "
marmalade
", "mama" and "raid". In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Mama-Raid
.
Maser Saber
(
鳴光剣
,
Mēzā Sāberu
?
, literally meaning "Roaring Light Sword")
: Another combined attack by Hera, Prometheus, and Napoleon. Instead of firing a beam like
Maser Ho
, the homies form a continuous blade of energy which Big Mom can utilize by wielding Napoleon. It was first used to cut Kid's
metal bull
clean in half.
Bahoho: Misery
(
母訪砲
三千里
,
Bahōhō: Mizarī
?
, literally meaning "Mother Visit Cannon: 3000 Leagues")
: Big Mom creates a giant female homie made of flames and lightning called "
Misery
" from her Maser Saber. The homie can then act independently and pursue its targets.
In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, this is called
Mother's Visit Cannon: 3000 Leagues of Misery
.
Weakness
[
]
Out of all the special homies, Napoleon, being a hat/sword, possesses the least amount of mobility. While it can stab and slash independently, with a significant amount of power, as well as hover a bit, its true power can only be achieved while being wielded by Linlin. This was seen when during the battle with the Worst Generation, when Napoleon was separated from Big Mom and attacked by
Killer
, he was unable to attack, dodge, defend or counter.
History
[
]
Past
[
]
At least 38 years ago, Napoleon was created by receiving a
soul fragment
from
Big Mom
herself.
Big Mom wore Napoleon as her hat, and the two have rarely been seen apart from each other.
Whole Cake Island Saga
[
]
Whole Cake Island Arc
[
]
When Big Mom developed a craving for croquembouche and went on a rampage through
Sweet City
, Napoleon grew worried and tried convincing her to not destroy the city, though his pleas were not heard. Big Mom was later satiated by
Jinbe
.
Two days later, Napoleon discussed with his captain about
Monkey D. Luffy
's chances of defeating
Charlotte Cracker
and escaping the
Seducing Woods
, assuming the invader was doomed since the very moment he confronted Cracker. He also told Big Mom about the recent arrival of
Vinsmoke Ichiji
and
Vinsmoke Niji
on the island.
Napoleon gets a signal of an intruder in the Room of Treasure.
Later in the day, Napoleon received a signal in the throne room and reported to
Big Mom
that there was
an intruder in
the Room of Treasure, causing Big Mom to go there.
When Big Mom slept that night, she spotted a fly and slammed it into the ground. Thinking there was an intruder in the room, Napoleon turned into a large sword and, along with
Zeus
and
Prometheus
, attacked the spot where Big Mom swatted the fly, before going back to sleep.
On the day of Sanji and Pudding's wedding, Napoleon was worn by Big Mom for the event as they eagerly waited for their chance to assassinate the Vinsmoke Family. However, the unexpected arrival of the
Straw Hat Pirates
and their breaking of Big Mom's beloved picture of Mother
Carmel
resulted in Big Mom flying into a rage and releasing a powerful burst of
Haki
that seemingly knocked out Napoleon as well, leaving his eyes completely blackened.
Big Mom chases after the Straw Hats with Napoleon in attack mode.
After the Whole Cake Chateau collapsed and Big Mom began having a craving illness for wedding cake,
Perospero
lied to her and told her that the Straw Hats had a spare cake. Big Mom quickly caught up to them while riding on
Zeus
and prepared to attack them with Napoleon's sword form.
Using Napoleon, Big Mom unleashed a devastating air slash that sliced off part of
Kingbaum
, which the Straw Hats were riding. As Big Mom prepared to attack again,
Nami
diverted Zeus' attention with
thunderclouds
, which caused the cloud homie to veer off-course to eat them, dropping Big Mom and Napoleon to the ground. As
Prometheus
angrily asked Zeus what he was doing, Napoleon reflected on how absorbed Zeus was by the thunderclouds.
As Big Mom pursued the
Thousand Sunny
on the seas with Perospero's assistance, Perospero conversed with Napoleon and spoke of his newfound hatred for the Straw Hats due to the injuries
Pedro
inflicted on him. Napoleon then commented that criminals of
Totto Land
do not have a future.
Napoleon continued to accompany Big Mom as she rampaged on Nuts Island after attempting to sink the Thousand Sunny with a massive wave homie.
After leaving Nuts Island, they resumed pursuing the Sunny again.
Big Mom damages the Thousand Sunny with Napoleon.
As Big Mom summoned Zeus and Prometheus back to her side, she wielded Napoleon in his sword form and went to attack the Sunny herself along with her special homies.
When Jinbe said that there was no cake on the ship, Big Mom grew enraged and activated Napoleon's
Cognac
form before attacking the
fish-man
, sending him flying into the ocean. She then used Napoleon to slice into the Sunny to find the cake, but Jinbe came back and blew them off the ship with a
powerful attack
. Big Mom quickly recovered, and Napoleon's blade stretched as they prepared to slice the entire Sunny in half. The Straw Hats managed to manipulate Zeus to shock Big Mom and Napoleon with lightning, but the two of them and Prometheus recovered and pursued the Sunny again.
When the Fire Tank Pirates approached the Thousand Sunny, they discovered the cake on Bege's ship and went after the Fire Tank Pirates as they sailed to
Liqueur Island
.
The Fire Tank Pirates later changed course to Funwari Island and Napoleon remained in Big Mom's hands as she followed them to that island and ate the cake.
Levely Arc
[
]
Napoleon was with Big Mom in her chamber as she talked to
Kaidou
about their shared hatred toward Luffy and her plans for revenge.
Wano Country Saga
[
]
Wano Country Arc
[
]
Napoleon accompanied Big Mom as she and her crew tried to enter Wano Country by climbing the waterfall around the country on the Queen Mama Chanter. However, just before they reached the top, King flew in and attacked the ship, causing it and everyone on it to fall into the sea.
Afterwards, Napoleon washed ashore on Kuri Beach along with Big Mom.
Big Mom suffered amnesia from the experience and Napoleon remained silent from then on.
Napoleon clashes against Kaidou's kanabo.
Napoleon finally talked again when Big Mom (who had now recovered from her amnesia) called for him during her imprisonment on
Onigashima
. Napoleon revealed that he had remained silent while Big Mom was amnesiac due to being shy. He was then used by Big Mom to clash with
Kaidou
's kanabo, with the force of the impact splitting the sky in two.
The
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
started an all-out war during the
Fire Festival
. Angered by Luffy's continued interferences in her affairs, Big Mom attacked him with Napoleon, blasting a hole straight through the walls of Onigashima, but Luffy dodged the attack.
The attack destroyed the sacred tree to which
Sasaki
had been chained, freeing him.
After Big Mom was knocked down by
Franky
and the
Kurosai FR-U IV
, Napoleon hovered over her in concern. Further aggravated by the continued interference of the Straw Hats, Big Mom grabbed Napoleon and prepared to attack Franky, who charged his
Radical Beam
. However, they were interrupted by the arrival of the
Numbers
. Big Mom attacked Franky after he fired his laser beam at one of the artificial giants, but before she could finish the swing, Jinbe and
Nico Robin
grabbed and rolled her out of the building.
Outside, Napoleon returned to Big Mom's head while she talked with Perospero and fought with Marco.
During Big Mom and Kaidou's confrontation against Luffy,
Roronoa Zoro
,
Eustass Kid
,
Killer
, and
Traflagar Law
on the roof of the Skull Dome, Big Mom wielded Napoleon once again.
During the fight, the Worst Generation worked together to separate Big Mom from her homies. Killer knocked Napoleon out of her hand and then chased him off, while Kid and Law knocked Big Mom off the island.
However, Napoleon was able to escape with Prometheus after Kaidou intervened, and Prometheus caught Big Mom before she plunged into the ocean.
Napoleon then returned to Big Mom's head. After Big Mom blasted a hole in the Skull Dome with her new lightning homie,
Hera
, Big Mom and her homies flew into the castle and searched for Kid.
Big Mom then summoned Napoleon, alongside his fellow homies Prometheus and
Hera
, to fight
Ulti
, combining their powers to unleash a powerful laser beam that took her down in one hit. When he tried to get closer to Hera, he was casually brushed off by her. When
Nami
and
Usopp
tried to flee from Big Mom, Big Mom infused Napoleon with Prometheus to kill them both, only to be assaulted by Kid.
He joined Big Mom alongside Hera and Prometheus as they prepared to battle Kid and Law.
He was then infused with Hera to strike at Kid with
Marma-Raid
, unsuccessfully though
and was once again infused with Hera when Big Mom, who was carried by Prometheus, tried to finish off Kid after sending him out of the Floor. Napoleon was separated by Big Mom forcefully, when Law, who awakened his Devil Fruit Powers, managed to hurt Big Mom's insides and was buried alongside Big Mom, Prometheus and Hera under the framework of Kaidou's castle by Kid, who turned Big Mom into a magnet with his awakened Devil Fruit powers.
Eventually, Big Mom broke free of the debris and turned the framework into homies by absorbing the souls of the nearby Beasts Pirates. After Big Mom used one year of her own life to grow massive in size, Napoleon, alongside Prometheus and Hera, grew massive in size as well, once again preparing to battle Kid and Law.
After beating up Law and Kid, Big Mom prepared to fly up to the roof and join Kaidou, but Law used
Shock Wille
on her again, causing her to drop Napoleon.
