The humanoid figure in the manga.
The humanoid figure in the anime.
In
Chapter 561
, Elmy can be seen fighting against Admiral Kizaru alongside some kind of large being which secrets a substance from its body similar to
Charlotte Opera
's body and
Prince Grus
's
golems
. In the
Digitally Colored Manga
, the substance is colored white. It is unknown what the humanoid figure is, or if Elmy or somebody else was responsible for it and could command it.
However, in the
anime counterpart
of the chapter, it was depicted as a very tall person with bandages wrapped around the body, similar to a mummy.
In the anime, she is among the news reports of those defeated by
Edward Weevil
