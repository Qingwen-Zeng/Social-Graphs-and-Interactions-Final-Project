As a fish-man, Capote possesses strength tenfold that of average humans, and double that in water. Unlike other fish-men, however, he seems to have little to no navigational skills, as he could not figure out which path to take in order to take advantage of the currents, something
Nami
was able to do with great ease.

Capote took part in luring the Straw Hats to Mushroom Island, where Foxy challenged them to a Davy Back Fight rematch. During the match, it was revealed that new crewmembers and undercover Marines
Komei
and
Dojaku
orchestrated it in order to capture the Straw Hats. The two succeeded in drugging and capturing Zoro, Sanji, Porche, and Hamburg, and redirected a Noro Noro beam that Foxy fired at them, immobilizing Capote and everyone on the beach.
Capote and the Foxy Pirates stayed behind as Foxy and Kansho joined the Straw Hats in their mission to rescue their comrades. Capote, Itomimizu, and Chuchun tried helping Brook and Chopper look for the Rebound Mushroom, but they were ambushed by the Marines. However, Capote, Itomimizu, and the Foxy Pirates sacrificed themselves to let Brook, Chopper, and Chuchun escape.
However, Brook, Chopper, and Chuchun befriended a giant snake creature named
Kinoconda
and freed the Foxy Pirates from the Marines. They then rode in Kinoconda's mouth to Nebulandia, where they freed Foxy and the Straw Hats. Capote and the Foxy Pirates accompanied Foxy in his quest to free Porche and Hamburg.
The Foxy Pirates returned outside in full force as they helped the Straw Hats beat back the Marines. The two crews then returned to Mushroom Island, where they parted ways. Foxy then spoke to his crew, encouraging them to continue their adventure.
