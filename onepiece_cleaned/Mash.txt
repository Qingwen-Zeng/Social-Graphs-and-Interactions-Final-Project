History
[
]
Hatchan's Sea-Floor Stroll
[
]
Hatchan followed the map that he was given by the
Macro Pirates
to find the secret takoyaki recipe.
He followed the map and found Mash.
After a short fight, Mash was easily defeated, and Hatchan ran to save
Camie
, angered since he thought the pirates lied to him.
After Hatchan beat Macro and his crew, he learned that there was a secret compartment in Mash's hat.
He returned and opened Mash's compartment, revealing the recipe and special takoyaki sauce.
Hatchan proceeded to take the defeated octopus and the sauce to make takoyaki for his crush,
Octopako
.
Hatchan later cooked the takoyaki for the citizens of
Headband Catfish Village
instead of Octopako.
It is unknown what happened to Mash afterwards.
