Supreme King Haki
and remain conscious from her loud scream.

Whole Cake Island Arc

On the roof of
Whole Cake Chateau
, Poire attended the
Tea Party
and wedding between
Sanji
and her sister
Charlotte Pudding
. When the tea party began, she was talking to an anthropomorphic frog.
When
Monkey D. Luffy
,
Jinbe
, and
Pedro
crashed the wedding and Jinbe declared that he was leaving the
Big Mom Pirates
, Poire joined several of her crewmates in attacking Jinbe.
The
Straw Hat Pirates
broke
Big Mom
's portrait of
Carmel
and caused Big Mom to unleash a massive scream, which incapacitated the Big Mom Pirates. After
Capone Bege
's assassination attempt on Big Mom failed,
Katakuri
created earplugs for himself and his crewmates. Poire watched as Katakuri rescued
Brûlée
from the clutches of the Straw Hats, who along with Jinbe and the
Fire Tank Pirates
were retreating inside Bege's
Big Father fortress
. The Big Mom Pirates besieged their enemies,
and when they attempted to escape after Bege returned to his normal form, Poire helped shoot at them with her machine gun, but the shots were blocked by the
Vinsmoke Family
.
The Big Mom Pirates defeated their enemies, but Big Mom's
Tamatebako
ended up falling off the Chateau and unleashed a massive explosion that toppled the Chateau.
The Big Mom Pirates and their guests fell onto Sweet City, but their fall was cushioned after
Streusen
turned part of the Chateau into cake.

When Big Mom tried to infiltrate

King
attacked the ship, causing the ship to fall off the waterfall and Big Mom to fall into the sea.
