Appearance
[
]
Gorishiro, as he is initially depicted in the anime
Gorishiro is a standard gorilla from the legs up, growing from Mizerka's hips. He has pink fur, purplish skin, and white fingernails. Mizerka's upper body sticks out of his abdomen, with her arms still inside Gorishiro. He also wears a white belt with yellow dots, and a minimalistic
Jolly Roger
of the
Beasts Pirates
, and a set of yellow- and black-striped headphones.
Personality
[
]
Gorishiro has a mind of his own, allowing him to act independently of Mizerka. He does share her enthusiasm during the Golden Kagura,
and where
Queen
declared a way for Mizerka to became a Tobiroppo.
He seems to behave very much like a stereotypical gorilla would, having a preference for bananas and being a messy eater.
Relationships

Mizerka
[
]
Gorishiro shares a body with Mizerka after the latter consumed a Gorilla SMILE
Devil Fruit
, and so the two normally act in tandem.
Gorishiro lax nature however, sometimes clashes with Mizerka's temper, example by the way he messily ate a banana while the Beasts Pirates were preparing to ambush
Monkey D. Luffy
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Though he is limited by only going where Mizerka goes, Gorishiro was ready to fight Luffy and
Roronoa Zoro
at a moment's notice, showing he is a capable fighter.
Gorishiro possesses a notable degree of strength, and is able to unleash powerful punches that can overwhelm lower-ranking members of the Beasts Pirates.
History

Wano Country Arc
[
]
On the day of the
Fire Festival
, Gorishiro was seen with Mizerka taking part in
Queen
's Golden Kagura festivities.
When the
Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance
later invaded
Onigashima
, Mizerka, other Gifters, and
Scratchmen Apoo
stood in Luffy and Zoro's way.
After the Alliance invaded the tower, Mizerka and
Poker
were stationed on the third level at the base of the stairs to the fourth level, where Gorishiro ate a banana above Mizerka and dropped crumbs on her head, annoying her.
Mizerka and Gorishiro later went to the Live Floor, and the latter attacked some of their crewmates who had defected. However,
Tama
then ordered the Gifters she had tamed with
kibi dango
, which included Mizerka, to fight against
Kaidou
, causing Mizerka and Gorishiro to defect to her side.
