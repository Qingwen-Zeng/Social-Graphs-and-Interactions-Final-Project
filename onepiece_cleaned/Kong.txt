Kong
is the Commander-in-Chief of the
World Government
. He was a
Fleet Admiral
of the
Marines
at the time of the
Battle of Edd War
twenty-seven years ago. Some time after, he was promoted while
Sengoku
eventually became the new Fleet Admiral.
Appearance
[
]
Kong's appearance 38 years before the present.
Kong is an extremely muscular, broad-chested, tan-skinned, strong-shouldered elderly man who has his whitened hair and beard arranged in an array of spikes, and some fuzz on both sides of his face, similar to a lizard's spine. He also has a stitched scar under his left eye.
He wears a sleeveless dark shirt adorned with medals, revealing his muscular arms, dark green armbands, a light yellow scarf around his neck, and a white and dark grey Marine coat draped over his shoulders. The epaulettes are similar to those worn by an Admiral and Fleet Admiral, fully covered in yellow as a standard color.
38 years before the present, Kong was noticeably younger, as well as lacking both his beard and scar.
Personality
[
]
Not much is known about Kong's personality but as a former
Marine
and a high ranking
World Government
official, he has a strong sense of justice (though it is unknown if it is moral or absolute).
He also has a large amount of pride for his position and the Marines overall, since he left
Garp
and
Sengoku
's records untouched to prevent the Marine name from being hurt and felt rather disappointed that they would resign.
Relationships
[
]
Monkey D. Garp
[
]
Kong respected
Garp
as he offered him the promotion to Admiral multiple times during the age of
Gol D. Roger
but was always rejected, something that frustrated him. He also respected Garp's decision to retire from the Marines and reassigned him as an instructor of training new recruits of young Marines, while keeping the records intact.
Sengoku
[
]
Kong and Sengoku are well acquainted as Sengoku once worked under him when Kong was Fleet Admiral. Following Garp's resignation, he also allowed Sengoku to retire before reassigning him to General Inspector. Both are on friendly terms as they were seen having a pleasant talk at
Mary Geoise
upon Sengoku's retirement.

Overview
[
]
While he was the fleet admiral of the Marines, he had absolute control of the organization, under the
World Government
. Now, as World Government Commander-in-Chief, he works for the World Government, and possesses not only power over the Marines, but also authority over the Government's espionage agents, the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
(prior to their abolishment),
Enies Lobby
, the
Cipher Pols
, and presumably the
Special Science Group
. According to the World Government hierarchy, his authority is second only to the
Five Elders
and
Imu
.
His political powers enabled him to revoke any Warlord of the Sea title at any time, as well as being able to declare a Buster Call on any island he deems to be a threat.
Aside from his political powers, his muscles and numerous scars suggest that he is physically strong and proficient in combat. However, he has yet to reveal his powers in the series.
Haki

Haki
It was stated that all marines ranked vice admiral and above possess Haki,
so with a rank above that, Kong can also use the ability.
History

Past
[
]
Not much is known about Kong's past, other than he held the rank of Admiral and was promoted to
Fleet Admiral
of the
Marines
at an unspecified point in time.
Thirty-eight years ago, Kong notified
Monkey D. Garp
of an
incident occurring on
God Valley
with the
World Nobles
and
Rocks Pirates
. Garp, who was on vacation, initially brushed off his concerns as the World Nobles already had
protection
until Kong informed him that
Gol D. Roger
was also there, causing Garp to take this concern seriously and head over.
Battle of the Edd War
[
]
Twenty seven years ago, by the time of the
Edd War
, Kong received a report about
Shiki
fighting Roger, and when
Vice Admiral
Garp charged into  the battle, Kong was seen shouting about the fact that their conversation was not yet over, despite Garp claiming it was.
Promotion
[
]
Kong eventually was promoted from Fleet Admiral to World Government Commander-in-Chief, thus working directly for the World Government and leaving the position vacant.
Summit War Saga

Post-War Arc

Kong meeting with Sengoku.
After the
Summit War of Marineford
, Garp approached Kong and resigned from the Marines despite the latter's attempts to persuade him otherwise. Three weeks after the war at
Mary Geoise
, Sengoku did the same thing. Kong was somewhat disappointed by these resignations, as both of them had been top Marines since Roger's time but allowed them to leave on the condition that their records and titles remain untouched in order to retain their influences and legacies in order to successfully recruit new Marines in the future and also to train the next generation of young Marines. Prior to leaving, Sengoku suggested to Kong that
Admiral
Aokiji
should be the succeeding Fleet Admiral.
