incredible ability to command the Sea Kings

Biography
[
]
Vander Decken was the
captain
of a pirate crew that existed hundreds of years ago, and they all rode on the Flying Dutchman. But then, according to legend, one dark and stormy night, Decken suddenly went mad and began killing off his crew mates by throwing them off the ship. He then invoked the wrath of
God
by defying him, and as a punishment, he and his ship were cursed to wander the seas forever.
However, as legends tend to exaggerate, several points are debatable. The only things that was certain is that Decken did exist and that he was definitely crazy.
At some point in his life, Vander Decken then came to the ocean floor to search for the legendary Mermaid Princess, who possessed the power to command
Sea Kings
. Unfortunately for him, he never achieved his goal, and Decken ended up dying on Fish-Man Island.
Legacy
[
]
Vander Decken's knowledge of the mermaid princess of legend was passed down to his descendants, who have been piloting the Flying Dutchman ever since. The current captain is his eighth generation grandson,
Vander Decken IX
, who found out that the current mermaid princess,
Shirahoshi
, had inherited the fabled power his family had searched for. Using his
abilities
, he constantly attempted to force the princess to marry him so that he can use her power for his own ambitions, but ultimately failed and was eventually arrested.
