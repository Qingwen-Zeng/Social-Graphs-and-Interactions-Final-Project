History

Dressrosa Saga
[
]
Dressrosa Arc
[
]
During
Operation SOP
, Chicory accompanied
Leo
and other members of the
Tonta Corps
to attack
Sugar
at the executive tower.
After
Robin
lured
Trebol
away, the dwarves confronted the girl and prepared to attack her. However, as they charged towards her, Sugar
turned
some of them into
toys
. Seeing as how the toys seemingly magically appeared in front of them, and having completely forgotten that they were their friends, Chicory and the remaining dwarves stared on in surprise and confusion at where they came from and what they were just doing.
Before long, they were all captured in Trebol's
slime
. Trebol then lit the slime on fire, causing all the dwarves to be burned in the explosion.
As they laid defeated, their trust in
Usopp
did not wane and they continued to cry out his name in the belief that he would come save them.
Hearing this, Usopp gave into their cries and returned to challenge Trebol and Sugar. However, he was quickly defeated and, as punishment, Sugar forced him to eat the supposedly poisonous grape. The dwarves watched on as their last hope of the
Tatababasco
was eaten by Usopp, but, to all of their surprise, Sugar ended up losing consciousness after being horrified by Usopp's facial reaction towards the spiciness of the Tatababasco.
In response, Chicory stared in utter disbelief at what just unfolded before her eyes.
