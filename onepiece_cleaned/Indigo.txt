Dr. Indigo
is the
scientist
of the
Golden Lion Pirates
and the secondary antagonist of the
tenth
One Piece
movie
. He is the one who created
Boss
and the other monstrous animals under
Shiki
's dominion.
Appearance
[
]
Indigo is a very tall man with a
clown-like
appearance. He has indigo hair, with two particularly large tufts at the side of the head, and his face is white, with purple lines near his eyes, presumably some sort of make-up. He is pot bellied, with thin limbs, and a muscular torso, making his body resemble a
volumetric flask
. On his forehead, he has a pair of purple round-shaped eyeglasses. He wears a large yellow polka dotted indigo scarf and indigo-striped shoes (similar to
Kuro
's) that make a farting noise every time he takes a step. He also wears indigo overalls that exposes his chest, with two lines of buttons on the front, and a lab coat over them. On his hands there is a pair of brown gloves. It seems that in his twenty years, he did not change much in appearance, aside from his scarf being orange with a lined pattern, and he did not wear glasses on top of his forehead.
Personality
[
]
Indigo is a doctor with an eccentric personality: he has a distinct
laugh
which goes "Piro piro piro", adorns shoes that emit sounds of flatulence whenever walking, not caring if others gets irritated by this, and also often tries to act like a
mime
, but usually breaks character by suddenly talking, though ironically becomes completely surprised if someone actually understood his
charade
type speech. He also appears to be careful, as he always carries around a vial of antidote to the Draft disease, just for precaution.
Relationships

Scarlet, Shiki, and Indigo doing a skit.
Indigo shares a rather humorous relationship with his captain Shiki. Whenever Shiki says or does something stupid, Indigo acts as a straight man and slaps him, after which they both present themselves to others like a typical comedy duo after a joke. He also has an habit of trying to explain something to Shiki through odd movements and gestures until Shiki tells him to just come out and say it (though at one point in the movie, Shiki understood what he was trying to say much to Indigo's surprise). Regardless, he is loyal to Shiki and spent twenty years creating super-powered creatures in
Merveille
for the
Golden Lion Pirates
to take over the world. He also plays a part in Shiki's dances, along with
Scarlet
.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Indigo is a chemist. He was the one in
charge
in the development of Shiki's scheme involving all the monstrous animals, and was the one who developed the
SIQ
serum. He is a strong fighter who was able to fight along side Shiki and his crew when they fought against the
Roger Pirates
. He is possibly a proficient swordsman, as he was seen attacking Luffy with a sword fitting his size, and wielding it during the battle in Shiki's palace.
Indigo is also a skilled dancer, taking part in all of his captain's little "dance shows".
Chemical Juggling
[
]
Indigo has the ability to produce explosive chemical orbs from his body and attack with them, a power he calls "
Chemical Juggling
"
(
ケミカルジャグリング
,
Kemikaru Jaguringu
?
)
. He can create bright green and purple chemical orbs somewhat similar to
Will-o'-the-wisps
, that are then arranged above him and shot from his hands one after another, in rapid succession, causing powerful explosions. He can also apparently condense his orbs into a larger one with a far more explosive effect, which he calls "
Mass Juggling
"
(
マスジャグリング
,
Masu Jaguringu
?
)
, that, although much more effective than his ordinary attack, needs more time to reach critical mass. The way he manipulates the chemicals resembles the skill of
Juggling
, befitting his clown-like appearance.
Due to Indigo being able to pull himself out of a pool of water after falling in, he is obviously not a
Devil Fruit
user. Instead, it appears that this ability stems from some sort of chemical he used on himself, also seen when, after being defeated by Zoro, he got enveloped by his own flames and exploded, such loss of control of own powers was only seen with
Foxy
at the Davy Back Fight, when Luffy redirected Foxy's
Noro Noro Beam
to him and he was slowed down by his own power.

History

Past

Battle in the Edd War and Afterwards
[
]
Indigo was at Shiki's side during the Battle in the Edd War, where the Golden Lion Pirates confronted the
Roger Pirates
. After the battle, he was seen at his captain's bedside, commenting on his positive attitude towards the steering wheel stuck in his head. He then slapped him in a comedic fashion for mistaking himself with a rooster.
It's unknown what happened to Indigo during Shiki's imprisonment in
Impel Down
, however when Golden Lion broke free of the prison and reached
Merveille
, the loyal scientist was once more at his side, ready to start developing an ambitious project to defeat the
World Government
: he will develop the
SIQ
serum from the IQ plants present on the flying island, making Shiki's plan of an army of mutated animals real.
The following events are
Non-Canon
and therefore not considered part of the
Canon
story.
Summit War Saga
[
]
Little East Blue Arc
[
]
Indigo was briefly seen during the
Little East Blue Arc
, commenting on
Boss
having escaped from him, and then reassuring his captain of the plan's guaranteed success.
One Piece Film: Strong World
[
]
Indigo was first seen dancing before
Nami
with Shiki and Scarlet, in the palace's greenhouse. He proudly showed his captain the new development,
a bird producing electricity from his feathers
, who ended up shocking the three pirates. He spent the major part of the film at his captain's side, miming the most important news before telling him and the onlookers openly; he was quite surprised when Shiki managed to understand the news regarding Nami's attempt to blow up the Daft Green trees just through his miming actions.
During the pirates meeting in the main hall, he was seen serving sake for the
sakazuki ceremony
. When the
Straw Hat Pirates
arrived and
Luffy
attempted to chase after Shiki, he tried to attack him with a sword, but he was stopped by
Zoro
. He fought alongside the others until the palace was attacked by the wild animals.
Indigo defeated by Zoro.
Later
Chopper
and
Usopp
manage to find Nami, who has been infected due to overexposure to the Daft Green plants, and start searching for a cure. They reach the palace's laboratory, but wind up running into Indigo, who has such a cure, but refuses to hand it over, preparing to fight the two. Zoro however arrives, and proceeds to battle him. Indigo shows off his Chemical Juggling ability, attacking the swordsman with his chemical orbs, but he's rapidly defeated when Zoro uses his
Asura: Ugui
and he loses control of the Chemical Juggling. He was last seen falling unconscious from the sky, together with Shiki and Scarlet, after his captain's
levitation control
over the islands was broken.
His current fate is unknown.
