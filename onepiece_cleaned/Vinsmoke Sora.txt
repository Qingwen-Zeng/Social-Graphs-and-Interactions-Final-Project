Appearance

Personality
[
]
Sora was a very kind and caring woman with great strength of character where she loved her children and was fiercely protective of them, believing that they should grow up with normal human emotions and not as cold killing machines. As a result, she did everything in her power to resist
her husband
's experiments on their sons, to the point of sacrificing her own life.
Sora deeply cherished compassion and doted in particular on
Vinsmoke Reiju
and
Sanji
, the only two of her children to exhibit empathy and compassion, in order to encourage these traits. She could also be very emotional, as she readily burst into tears when recounting Sanji's well wishes to Reiju and
Époni
.
Relationships
[
]
Vinsmoke Judge
[
]
Sora and her husband
Vinsmoke Judge
had conflicting ideals, which were complicated by their positions as the
monarchic rulers
of the warmongering
Germa Kingdom
. While Judge wanted to endow their sons with surgical enhancements that would give them
superhuman
power to wage and win wars, Sora did not want it to cost them their humanity. Ultimately, Judge forced her to undergo the surgery, and Sora, maintaining her opposition, took a drug to counteract the surgery and eventually succumbed to its after-effects.
After Sora passed away, Judge wished to move on from her way of doing things as he saw no merit and nothing to be gained by continuing the legacy of a deceased person and did not want his children to emulate her kind actions.
In modifying the
Lineage Factor
of their quadruplet sons against her will, and then neglecting and discarding
Sanji
(their only son to live up to Sora's efforts), Judge effectively trampled on Sora's wishes.
Children
[
]
Sora loved all of her children and it was this love which motivated her to risk her own life. While she was pregnant with their four sons, she took a drug that was intended to counteract the effects of the genetic modification surgery
Vinsmoke Judge
would ultimately force her to undergo. However, the drug failed to work on
Vinsmoke Ichiji
,
Vinsmoke Niji
and
Vinsmoke Yonji
, leaving
Sanji
as the only one capable of experiencing empathy.
While not much is known about her relationship with Ichiji, Niji and Yonji, Sora's love was reciprocated by
Vinsmoke Reiju
and Sanji, both of whom would occasionally visit her in the medical ward. Sora doted in particular on Sanji due to the latter's kindness and compassion. She ate his poorly-made food (which tasted disgusting) with a smile and praised him as the "sweetest boy in the world" when he told her his hopes for her quick recovery. During Reiju's visits, Sora would proudly share with her daughter stories about Sanji's emotional growth.
After Sora's passing, Sanji continued to develop his cooking skills and decided to become a
cook
in her memory.
An adult Reiju also continues to recall memories of her mother with great fondness while harboring great anger and resentment towards Judge for contributing directly to Sora's death. However, this resentment does not seem to extend to her brothers. When Sanji finally learned from Reiju the reason for their mother's early death, Sanji was horrified and began to blame himself, but Reiju stopped him by telling him that Sora had no regrets about her choice.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
As
queen consort
of the
Germa Kingdom
, Sora had authority over its citizens before her death, although her command appeared to be second to that of
her husband
's. She also had enough scientific knowledge to procure and consume a drug to counteract genetic enhancement surgery on her unborn children, although the drug had lethal side effects which caused irreversible damage to her health.
History

Biography
[
]
At some point in the past, Sora
married
Vinsmoke Judge
, thereby becoming queen of the
Germa Kingdom
. Twenty-four years ago, she later gave birth to their first and only daughter named
Vinsmoke Reiju
and she soon became pregnant with quadruplet sons (
Vinsmoke Ichiji
,
Vinsmoke Niji
,
Sanji
and
Vinsmoke Yonji
) three years later.
Sora takes a drug to try to humanize her sons.
Before their sons were born, Sora argued with her husband about giving them genetic modifications and she was against him turning their sons into emotionless beings, but Judge was only concerned with giving them the physical power and emotional coldness to fight and win wars. Sora was eventually forced to undergo surgery, but she took a drug that was intended to counteract the effects of the surgery. However, the drug she took only affected Sanji while weakening her health to the point of death. Despite this, Sora had no regrets and was immensely overjoyed and proud whenever Sanji showed signs of kindness.
In her final years, Sora was bedridden in the Germa Kingdom's medical ward where she was attended to by
Époni
. On one occasion, Sanji visited his mother and gave her a meal that he had prepared for her. Even though it looked and tasted terrible, she ate the meal and said it was delicious.
On another occasion, Sanji told her that he hoped she would recover soon, leaving her in tears. Sora was also regularly visited by Reiju, to whom Sora would often speak happily about Sanji and his continued emotional growth.
Sora died over 13 years ago prior to the Germa Kingdom's invasion of
Cozia
in the
East Blue
.
Legacy
[
]
Despite
Vinsmoke Judge
considering Sora's values to be worthless to the point that he scorned their third son for upholding her legacy,
Sanji
's kindness and compassion would ironically prove crucial in saving the
Vinsmoke Family
from being assassinated by the
Big Mom Pirates
in the future. Despite all the suffering his father and brothers caused him, Sanji still chose to save his family due to having the kindness Sora cherished and valued so much.
Vinsmoke Reiju
was also extremely moved by the lengths Sanji would go to save their family, despite the cruelty they had shown him.
Years later, Sanji developed the same modifications as his brothers during the
raid on Onigashima
due to repeatedly wearing the
Raid Suit
he had been given.
Fortunately, Sora's efforts were not in vain despite gaining genetic enhancements, Sanji still retain his compassion and empathy unlike his brothers as his new found strength along with his compassion which Sora died to preserve allow him to better help people instead of hurting the innocent as Sanji defeated Queen, further contribute to Wano's liberation from twenty years of tyranny under the Beast Pirates.
