Mr. 9
is the code name of a former
Frontier Agent
and
bounty hunter
of
Baroque Works
, and
Miss Wednesday
's former assigned partner during her infiltration.
Due to his actions, he is one of the main antagonists of the
Reverse Mountain Arc
, and a supporting antihero in the
Whisky Peak Arc
. He is currently married to
Miss Monday
.
Appearance
[
]
Mr. 9 is a young man who wears a golden crown on top of his red hair and has his agent number written on his cheeks. He wears a green suit with white lace along with a ruffled red scarf. His attire makes him look like a prince or a king, but he is neither.
After two years, his hair is much longer, and he has grown a bit of a mustache. He wears a different, longer scarf and has erased his agent numbers. His clothes also look different, lacking the lace that trimmed the collar and sleeves. His crown is the same, though.
Personality
[
]
Mr. 9 is very sure of himself and very loyal to his friends. His favorite phrase is "Bye bye, baby;" these were his last words to Miss Wednesday before he attempted to hold off
Mr. 5
so she could escape. Unlike Officer Agents, who seem to believe that friendship is a sign of weakness, Mr. 9 is shown to highly value friendship and loyalty, as shown when he fought for
Vivi
's sake. Due to this, it is proved that he does indeed have a more heroic side to him, in contrast to his role as a Baroque Works agent.
He seems to have a superiority complex, wanting to appear to be a prince. He also tends to perform noble gestures in a very uncouth manner, such as bowing and raising his pinky finger when grabbing an object.
Relationships
[
]
Nefertari Vivi
[
]
He and
Vivi
were partners at
Baroque Works
when she was Miss Wednesday, both working as a team without a problem. When she is identified as an intruder in the organization, he shows his friendship by defending her and fighting Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine so she could escape. He claimed that while he did not understand the circumstances, he would buy her time due to their long relationship as partners.
Miss Monday
[
]
Initially, he and
Miss Monday
were companions as Frontier Agents at Baroque Works, working together at
Whiskey Peak
. At some point during the timeskip, they ended up being a couple and having a child.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Mr. 9 was skilled enough to become a Frontier Agent. He uses his metal bats in conjunction with his acrobatic skills to deal damage to foes. His body is quite flexible, as he is able to perform several acrobatic jumps and cartwheels. Despite this, he is a weak foe; his acrobatics being useless against Officer Agents such as Mr. 5, and he is clumsy enough to fall off a building unprovoked while fighting
Zoro
.
Weapons
[
]
Mr. 9 wields two steel bats and uses them in conjunction with his "acro
bat
ics". With the momentum generated from his gymnastic feats, they can be quite powerful. He also hides steel ropes within the bats, allowing to subdue foes as shown in his fight against Zoro. However, this technique was used against him, causing his defeat. He also used a bazooka during the Reverse Mountain Arc and was seen wielding a pistol when first introduced.

History
[
]
Arabasta Saga
[
]
Reverse Mountain Arc
[
]
Vivi (as Miss Wednesday) and Mr. 9 prepare to kill Laboon.
Mr. 9 and
Nefertari Vivi
(known as Miss Wednesday at the time) traveled to
Reverse Mountain
in order to kill
Laboon
so they could bring the
Island Whale
's meat to
Whisky Peak
as food. They entered the whale and targeted
Crocus
, who was living inside the whale's stomach and protecting the whale.
Monkey D. Luffy
accidentally knocked Mr. 9 and Vivi into the sea of stomach acid, but the three were saved by the other
Straw Hat Pirates
. Mr. 9 and Vivi then tried to blast a hole through the whale's stomach, but Crocus jumped into the path of the cannonballs. When Mr. 9 and Vivi tried again, Luffy punched both of them in the head, knocking them unconscious, and the pair were then tied up.
After exiting the whale, the Straw Hats tossed Mr. 9 and Vivi overboard, and the pair swam away.
On a raft, Mr. 9 and Vivi continued to spy on the Straw Hats because the pirates had taken their
Log Pose
.
Mr. 13
and
Miss Friday
dropped a bomb on the raft, destroying it and sending Mr. 9 and Vivi to the shore of Reverse Mountain.
Sanji
helped Vivi out of the water and ignored Mr. 9. The pair begged to be taken back to Whisky Peak.
Nami
revealed that the Log Pose had been broken, which upset Mr. 9 and Vivi, but then she revealed that Crocus had given them another one. Luffy agreed to let them aboard. As the
Going Merry
sailed away, Mr. 9 and Vivi laughed to themselves about the pirates' stupidity.
Whisky Peak Arc
[
]
Mr. 9 and Frontier Agents of Whisky Peak gathered to capture the Straw Hat Pirates.
As they navigated towards the island, Miss Wednesday and Mr. 9 jumped overboard before landing on shore.
That night, Vivi and Mr. 9 met up with
Igaram
, who informed them that the Straw Hats had fallen to hell. When
Miss Monday
showed up and questioned whether they should have thrown that party for the Straw Hats when the town was already short on food to begin with, citing the Mr. 9 pair's failure to get the whale meat, Vivi and Mr. 9 defended themselves by claiming they had tried their best. Vivi was shocked when Igaram showed her and the others Luffy's bounty of
30,000,000. After Zoro appeared and revealed that he knew of Baroque Works, Vivi and the others prepared to kill him.
After Zoro displayed his strength by effortlessly taking out dozens of bounty hunters, including Miss Monday, Vivi and the other agents assumed that he was the real captain of the Straw Hats and that the Marines made a mistake with their bounties.
Mr. 9 fell off a building while trying to kill Zoro. After Mr. 9 managed to bind Zoro with the iron wire stored in his bat, Vivi held a sleeping Luffy hostage with a knife and told Zoro not to move as Igaram prepared to attack. However, Zoro threw Mr. 9 into a building before slamming him into Vivi, and both were defeated.
Mr. 9 protects Miss Wednesday from Mr. 5.
After Vivi's identity was exposed by
Mr. 5
and
Miss Valentine
,
Mr. 9 tried to hold them off to allow her to escape, as he had grown fond of Vivi during their time together. He declared that they were still partners, effectively placing his loyalty to her above his loyalty to
Baroque Works
. Mr. 5 was irritated by this and finished him off with a
Nose Cannon
attack that knocked Mr. 9 into a river.
