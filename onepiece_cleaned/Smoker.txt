Introduction
History
Smoker the White Hunter
is a
Marine
vice admiral
and the Commander of the Marines
G-5
Branch's Unit 01; as well as the Base Commander of the G-5
Marine base
, following the treason of his former superior
Vergo
. He was first introduced as a
captain
in
Loguetown
, where he made it his mission to capture
Luffy
,
and was later promoted to the rank of
commodore
,
due to the events in the
Arabasta Kingdom
.
Since his debut, he has been the superior of
Tashigi
, serving as her mentor as well.
He is a recurring adversary of Luffy. Due to his actions against Luffy at Loguetown, Smoker can be considered as the main antagonist of the
Loguetown Arc
, and acts as a minor antagonist during the
Marineford Arc
. Despite his rivalry with Luffy, they ended up helping each other during the
Arabasta Arc
and forming a temporary alliance during the
Punk Hazard Arc
.
Appearance
[
]
Smoker is a muscular, tall man with a distinct trait of always being seen smoking two cigars at once. He has short silvery-white hair cut in a textured pompadour fade style (his hair appears pale teal in the pre-timeskip anime). He has brown eyes which sometimes appear red, such as during the Punk Hazard arc. He wears a large thick white and blue specialist marine jacket which he keeps open, with greenish fur lining the neck, wrists, and hem. The jacket bears the kanji for "justice"
(
正義
,
Seigi
?
)
written on the back of it. Many cigars are strapped to the jacket. He carries a
Seastone
-tipped
jitte
as his weapon, although it has been broken twice: once during the
Summit War of Marineford
by
Boa Hancock
, and once on
Punk Hazard
by
Vergo
. He also wears brown leather gloves, blue jeans with a brown belt, and large military-issue brown leather boots. Furthermore, during his time in
Arabasta
, he also sported goggles. The fact that he rides a custom-made motorbike gives off the impression of a delinquent marine.
In the manga, his hair has a snowy white tone and the fur on his coat was initially blue, later changed to dark green, and ultimately modified to follow the anime, albeit with a much lighter green tone, and with green zips as well.
During his stay on an unknown island of the
Grand Line
, he was seen without his jacket, which he had a subordinate carry for him. During this time, he was seen keeping his jitte strapped to his back via a series of belts. A scar was visible on the right side of his chest.
After the timeskip, his hair is now longer, slicked back, and the sides have been shaved. He now sports a pair of black glasses. He has a stitche scar that extends from his forehead to his right eye and tapers off to the side of his face. He also added the traditional Marines' military coat over his attire, draped over his shoulders like a cape with his jitte, which has either been replaced or repaired since the Summit War of Marineford, hanging on the back; he is one of the few high-ranking marines (more specifically, a vice admiral) to not wear a conventional suit.
As a child, he sported the same hairstyle as his pre-timeskip appearance. His face is depicted as being dirty, with a runny nose and a bandage on his forehead, looking as if he just had a brawl with someone. He wore a plain blank white shirt and had a pair of goggles around his neck. He wore a pair of simple black pants and a pair of simple black boots. He also wore a pair of mittens or boxing gloves and carried around a baseball bat with nails in it, and was accompanied by an exhausted-looking dog.
During his time as a cadet, his hair was styled into a classic military buzz cut, and he was already smoking cigars, though only had one in his mouth at a time.
In
One Piece: Stampede
, he wears an unbuttoned white shirt, black pants with a pink sash tied around his waist, and brown boots. He also wears a black pirate captain jacket, with the red inside.

Personality
[
]
Smoker is a seasoned Marine soldier, infamous among his organization for his loose cannon tendencies and obstinate, rebellious attitude towards even his superiors. Smoker, however, is above all, an honorable man who values the difference between right and wrong above all else. This could first be seen at the end of the Alabasta Saga, when Smoker discovered that the superiors intended to cover up the incident and give the credit for Crocodile's capture to him and Tashigi, Smoker was extremely angered and disgusted by such an immoral action, as the true perpetrators were the Straw Hats and he strongly refused to take credit for other people's achievements, even if they were pirates, especially since Tashigi was crying in frustration at not being able to do anything at that time. Even something beneficial to his reputation, such as an award or promotion, will cause Smoker to lash out against the top brass, especially if he feels like he did not earn it.
However, Smoker does show interest in climbing up the ranks, if only to widen his authority to act freely.
Unlike many other marines in One Piece, Smoker does not follow the rule of
Absolute Justice
, following his own personal code of justice instead, which he later preaches to his subordinate
Tashigi
. This perception of justice allows Smoker to be flexible regarding who he can view as an ally or not, depending on the circumstances and what he witnesses during them. The
Straw Hat Pirates
are perhaps the biggest example of this, as whenever they meet, the Marine and the
pirates
often have a greater enemy in common, so Smoker lets them run free or even outright joins forces with them for the sake of saving innocents. However, as a Marine, Smoker frequently warns the Straw Hats that he will arrest them at any other time, in accordance with his duty.
Smoker shows his kindness by comforting Yu after she bumped into him.
Smoker is an extremely serious and gruff man, and has very rarely been shown to smile, if at all. He is often sharp and caustic towards people who come off as nuisances to him, and gets irritated at silly or stupid antics that disturb his peace. However, he is profoundly dedicated and driven to protecting innocent people and his subordinates from harm. Smoker treats his underlings with the same respect as his peers and never abuses his position for selfish purposes, unlike several high-ranking marines. Despite his somber manners, Smoker does seem to have a benevolent personality, particularly regarding children and civilians.
Smoker is merciless against pirates, usually taking a straightforward but efficient approach in capturing them. He is dedicated to the pursuit of global justice against criminals, and never forgets those who forsake the law and manage to escape his grasp, though he recognizes that not all Marines are as noble as their image suggests, nor should all allies be trusted blindly. Smoker holds a rather cynical worldview that makes him question even the Marines, considering the existence of traitors within their ranks a likely possibility. He also does not trust the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
despite their status as employees of the
World Government
, as he believes them to be nothing more than pirates (according to him, "once a pirate, always a pirate"), meaning that Smoker rarely leaves them to their own devices.
This is exacerbated by the fact that Smoker has confronted no less than four different warlords for various reasons, often for knowing too much about their machinations.
Smoker tends to hold grudges toward pirates who have escaped him, to the point of ignoring other notable pirates in his way. For example, he recognized
Portgas D. Ace
, a member of the
Whitebeard Pirates
, and was ready to confront him in battle, but after
Monkey D. Luffy
unexpectedly interrupted them, Smoker barely acknowledged Ace's presence and started chasing the Straw Hat captain, who he considers his primary target ever since their scuffle at
Loguetown
. It is worth noting that Smoker's interest in Luffy goes deeper than just that; Smoker has witnessed parallels between
Gold Roger
and the young pirate, such as a
defiant smile
in the face of death as well as seemingly miraculous luck.
Smoker stacking stones as entertainment.
As can be deduced from his name, Smoker is an avid smoker, almost never being seen without at least one cigar on his mouth. He is such a habitual smoker that he continues smoking even when wearing a gas mask. He also instinctively prefers to walk around with his chest bare, doing so even after having his mind transferred to the body of a woman. Smoker seems to have a hobby in
rock balancing
.
As such, he does not seem to like when people make too much noise around him, as he claims that it breaks his focus.
Relationships
[
]
Marines
[
]
Smoker's reputation among the Marines is rather notorious, although not entirely in a positive manner. This generally stems from his disrespectful attitude, problematic history, and intimidating looks. For those reasons, civilians and even some lower-ranked Marines can become nervous at his presence, especially when he starts berating them.
Smoker is not afraid to openly challenge the higher-ranking echelons within the Marines or the
World Government
, going as far as to use a brutal insult in an attempt to reject a promotion that he did not want, showing no fear for any potential backlash.
Tashigi
[
]
Smoker has a close relationship with his subordinate
Tashigi
, who is always dutifully at his side. Tashigi is a protégé of Smoker. However, he appears to react very harshly to her mistakes (usually caused by her clumsiness or poor vision) and sometimes thinks of her as a sorry excuse for a soldier.
Despite this, Smoker has shown that he trusts her judgment, encouraging her to just follow her own sense of justice in times of doubt. When Smoker needs to absent himself during a mission, he puts Tashigi in charge of his other subordinates, also putting trust in her strength.
Tashigi cries after receiving stimulus phrases from Smoker.
After the events of the
Arabasta Arc
, Tashigi could not contain her frustration for needing the aid of the
Straw Hat Pirates
in order to apprehend
Crocodile
, especially after Smoker praised her efforts through the whole ordeal. Smoker thought Tashigi was brave for being able to acknowledge her own weakness, urging his other subordinates to follow her example. It is worth noting that Tashigi's powerlessness regarding her encounter with Crocodile was one of the reasons Smoker declined the promotions and awards meant for them for the Warlord's capture (something they had little involvement in), as Smoker felt this was an insult to her honor.
Tashigi usually refers to her superior as "Smoker-san" (a simple Japanese honorific) as opposed to by his rank that other soldiers call him (i.e., "Vice Admiral Smoker"). Tashigi always follows Smoker's directives, rarely questioning them. However, during the events of the
Punk Hazard Arc
, Tashigi demonstrated some defiance towards her superior when she begged for her life in spite of Smoker's protests, berating the vice-admiral for being too prideful in a situation where the lives of his subordinates and the innocent children
Caesar Clown
had captured for his experiments were in massive danger.
Hina
[
]
Smoker and Hina working together in a mission.
Smoker has close ties with
Hina
, as she is a personal friend from their days of training. She has stood up for Smoker in situations that could have gotten him fired, which were apparently numerous.
This was further established in present time when Smoker talked back to the higher-ups who wanted to promote him, with Hina desperately reminding Smoker of the potential consequences for insubordination.
Because they have known each other for a long time, Hina calls him Smoker-kun (a Japanese honorific used usually for younger peers) while Smoker addresses Hina by her name alone (which, in Japanese, shows either a sign of disrespect or closeness). Hina already seems to be used to Smoker's signature obstinacy, arguing with him in a casual, somewhat vitriolic manner. She is also aware of Smoker's softer side, to which Smoker just told her to "mind her own business".
Kuzan
[
]
Kuzan treats Smoker after being defeated by Doflamingo.
Smoker seems to be on good terms with
Kuzan
, as he requested Aokiji to pass a message to Monkey D. Luffy at some point after the Arabasta Arc,
and later convinced the then Admiral to negotiate with
Sengoku
for a transfer to the more dangerous
G-5
station in the
New World
.
Although both Sengoku and Aokiji resigned before either could grant Smoker his request, the new Fleet Admiral, Sakazuki, was benign enough to transfer Smoker there.
Even after his resignation, Kuzan saved Smoker from being killed by
Donquixote Doflamingo
on the basis that they were still friends, all while comforting Smoker about certain negative rumors that were surrounding the former Admiral and ensuring that he had not changed his ways after leaving the Marines.
Issho
[
]
Smoker talks to Issho about the problems with the Seven Warlords of the Sea system.
Smoker appears to have become well acquainted with
Fujitora
, as he, like Kuzan, believes the Seven Warlords of the Sea system should be dissolved. He later expressed both his shock and gratitude to have learned that Fujitora did not let the government cover up the ordeal in Dressrosa as they did in Arabasta to which Smoker was grateful for and even admitted that if he were in Fujitora's position, he would not be able to do what Fujitora did.
G-5
[
]
Smoker giving orders to the G-5.
Currently, as the base commander in charge of G-5, Smoker has authority over the personnel stationed there. The soldiers are known to be sadistic, prone to torturing, and ignoring regulations, but obey Smoker with no problem. Smoker, in turn, shows contempt for them due to their blatant disregard for laws.
Still, Smoker is protective of his troops, ordering Tashigi to make sure they are kept safe when he is not around, and the G-5 soldiers, likewise, care for Smoker's well-being, relying on him for leadership.
When Smoker learned that Vergo had attacked their subordinates, he told his former superior he had no right to even lay a finger on his men.
Enemies
[
]
Monkey D. Luffy
[
]
Smoker has a strong desire (or even an obsession) to arrest
Luffy
dating back to when the pirate was about to be executed by
Buggy
in Loguetown. Smoker saw the smile Luffy gave off to mirror that of
Gold Roger
's twenty-two years ago and considered Luffy to be a potential danger to the world. Smoker has always wondered why Dragon would rescue Luffy in Loguetown, until Sengoku made it public that Dragon is Luffy's father, which intensified Smoker's thought about Luffy's dangerous potential.
Smoker facing Luffy in Marineford.
Ever since witnessing Luffy's smile during his aborted execution, Smoker has been relentless in trying to pursue Luffy and arrest him. Despite Luffy ordering Zoro to save Smoker from drowning after escaping the Rainbase Casino, Smoker still had the ambition to someday capture Luffy, only recouping him by letting him go that one time. Smoker is even willing to go as far as to the
New World
to capture Luffy, and has waited two years for Luffy to finally arrive. Smoker is Luffy's longest running Marine adversary to date.
Due to Smoker's desire to apprehend Luffy for such an extended period, he seems to have learned of Luffy's habits based on the various encounters with him as well as information from news reports. Smoker was able to correctly predict Luffy's desire to go to
Raijin Island
due to the
Log Pose
pointing at the island being the most turbulent, fitting Luffy's reckless nature.
Indeed, Luffy was originally planning to go there,
were he not diverted by a distress call from
Punk Hazard
. Smoker was also willing to enter Punk Hazard to pursue Luffy, despite the Government placing the island off-limits. When he finally saw Luffy for the first time in two years, he immediately attacked him despite Smoker being stuck in Tashigi’s body due to Law’s abilities. He was also very embarrassed when Luffy laughed at him because of his peculiar situation and became infuriated when Luffy refused to battle him in that condition.
Due to the situation, when
Trafalgar Law
and Luffy allied with each other and defeated
Caesar Clown
, Smoker once again let Luffy go.
However, Smoker's desire to arrest him is more out of a sense of duty as a Marine and caution due to being aware of the threat that Luffy may pose to the World Government in the future, as Smoker is not shown to have any particular or specific hatred towards him. In the same way, Luffy himself does not appear to hate Smoker. In fact, he even admitted that he liked the Marine, much to Smoker's annoyance. During the
Arabasta Arc
, the Straw Hat captain ordered
Roronoa Zoro
to save him when they were escaping the flooded
Rain Dinners
secret chamber, solely because he did not want the Marine to drown (knowing that Devil Fruit users are helpless underwater). Still, Luffy used to be rather afraid of Smoker due to having no reliable way to counter his Logia abilities, leading to several pursuits where Luffy desperately attempted to shake off Smoker and his forces.
After learning
Haki
, Luffy does not seem to fear Smoker anymore, having proclaimed his desire to have a rematch with the Marine vice-admiral someday, postponing it due to Smoker's "
handicap
" at the time. He also appears to view Smoker as more of a friend than an enemy now, even showing concern for his well-being after witnessing his unconscious body laying around right after the Marine's fight with Trafalgar Law.
Portgas D. Ace
[
]
Smoker made an enemy of
Ace
during the
Arabasta Arc
. Smoker simply stated that he could not let a pirate such as Ace go so easily, but when Luffy showed up, the Marine captain started prioritizing the Straw Hat captain while ignoring the Whitebeard pirate.
Smoker clashed with Ace when the latter stood in his way in order to protect Luffy, with Smoker cursing Luffy's brother for interfering on his chase.
Monkey D. Dragon
[
]
Smoker only met the
Revolutionary Army
leader,
Monkey D. Dragon
, once, during the
Loguetown Arc
. However, the revolutionary's sudden appearance left a lasting impression on Smoker's mind, since the Marine could not fathom why someone like Dragon would assist Luffy in escaping his clutches, which contributed to Smoker's desire to venture into the
Grand Line
after the Straw Hat Pirates.
Smoker would eventually learn about the connection between Dragon and Luffy during the
Summit War of Marineford
, finally getting an answer to the events of that day.
Seven Warlords of the Sea
[
]
Smoker is known to hate the
Seven Warlords of the Sea
, viewing them as nothing more than pirates, and thus not worth trusting. Smoker involved himself in Warlord-related schemes at least twice and has confronted several of them either because he meddled into their affairs or attacked someone they cared about.
Smoker indirectly contributed to the dissolution of the Warlord system when he told Admiral Fujitora about the
Arabasta incident
, inspiring the admiral to elaborate a plan of his own to let the world witness the chaos the Warlords were creating.
After the Warlord system was disbanded, Smoker is once more enemies with the remaining of the former Warlords.
Crocodile
[
]
Crocodile
imprisoned Smoker along with the
Straw Hat Pirates
in a
Seastone
Cage at
Rain Dinners
.
The Baroque Works leader planned to silence the marine captain by killing him alongside the Straw Hats while covering up his death. Later on, Crocodile stumbled into a badly wounded Tashigi and mocked the fact Smoker was not around to help her, thinking he had fled Arabasta.
During the Summit War of Marineford, Smoker was very surprised to see Luffy cooperating with Crocodile.
Boa Hancock
[
]
Hancock protects Luffy from Smoker.
Hancock
considers Smoker a personal enemy after he pinned down and attempted to kill Luffy. Hancock swore to "rip him to shreds and feed him to beasts".
Hancock intercepted Smoker when he tried to attack Luffy once more, breaking his jitte in the process. Smoker warned Hancock that her actions might lead to her
Warlord of the Sea
status being revoked, something that Hancock was convinced would not happen due to her beauty.
Donquixote Doflamingo
[
]
Smoker and Doflamingo face to face in Punk Hazard.
When
Donquixote Doflamingo
arrived at
Punk Hazard
looking for Law and the Straw Hats after
the events that had transpired there
, he began attacking the G-5 Marines that were still doing rescue work in the island. Doflamingo demanded Smoker to reveal the whereabouts of the newly formed
Pirate Alliance
, to which Smoker refused while derisively bringing up Vergo's involvement in the whole episode. Figuring that Smoker had learned a lot about his
underworld
operations, Doflamingo was left with no choice but to try silencing the vice-admiral.
After the intervention of
Kuzan
,
Doflamingo spared Smoker's life as he did not want to risk fighting a former Admiral.
Trafalgar D. Water Law
[
]
Smoker cooperates with Trafalgar Law to flee Caesar's laboratory.
When Smoker encountered
Trafalgar Law
at
Punk Hazard
, he demanded answers from the then Warlord of the Sea about the mysteries surrounding the island, some regarding who Law was working for, indicating a hidden agenda.
They battled each other, and Law managed to gain the upper hand by stealing Smoker's heart with his
Mes
attack. While Smoker yielded in defeat, Law commented that he did not have to tell him anything,
switching Smoker and Tashigi's bodies so they would be unable to get in his way again.
However, once Law, Luffy, Smoker and Tashigi all got captured by Caesar Clown, they formed a temporary alliance in order to defeat the evil scientist and his ally Vergo. Smoker was reluctant about joining forces with Law due to the conditions he had set for him to change back his and Tashigi's bodies (which was to not mention his or Luffy's involvement in subsequent reports), but was convinced by a desperate Tashigi to accept his terms for the sake of his men. Law also reaffirmed that Smoker was under his debt since he could have just killed him instead.
Later on, in the SAD Production Room, Smoker inadvertently saved Law by taking over his fight with Vergo, managing to swipe back Law's heart from Vergo's possession and thus getting even with the Warlord. With Vergo having been dealt with, Law and Smoker worked together to find a means of escaping the island for the others to use. Afterwards, while everybody else partied over Caesar's defeat, Smoker had a small chat with Law and showed curiosity about what kind of plan he had in mind while allying with the Straw Hats. Law left Smoker with only a
small cryptic clue
about his next steps, which Smoker seemingly noted in his mission report to
New Marineford
.
Caesar Clown
[
]
Caesar viewed Smoker as a threat to his operations at Punk Hazard. Describing the vice-admiral as a "pain-in-the-neck", Caesar was seemingly aware of Smoker's reputation as a stubborn and meddlesome marine.
When Law stole Smoker's heart and handed it to Caesar as a gift, Caesar became pleased.
After being defeated by Luffy, Caesar attempted to take Smoker down with him as revenge, unaware that the heart Law had given to him was in fact
Monet
's.
Vergo
[
]
When he was still base commander,
Vergo
put on a friendly front to soldiers and civilians in order to avoid suspicion. He admitted that he had been concerned about Smoker's transfer to G-5, mentioning that he had to put up the largest possible guard to prevent the newly transferred Marine from finding out his true affiliation. Vergo also expressed the desire to murder both Smoker and Tashigi "by accident", since they now knew about his secret identity.
After being released from his confinement, Smoker expressed disdain for his colleague's felonies and intended to battle him alone in retribution for his treason against the
Marines
.
Non-Canon
[
]
Daddy Masterson
[
]
Daddy
is apparently very close to Smoker, with the latter being familiar enough with Daddy's daughter
Carol
(Daddy refers to Smoker as "Uncle Smoker" to Carol). Daddy often hands over the pirates he catches for Smoker to imprison. Smoker claims that it is unfortunate that the Marines' best sniper was reduced to a common bounty hunter, demonstrating his respect for Daddy's skills.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Smoker is a formidable combatant, as on top of his sheer strength, his
Logia
Devil Fruit
abilities set him apart from most Marines of his rank. Before Luffy came, it was said that pirate activity in Loguetown had dropped down significantly since Smoker's arrival, a testament to his competency. In
Loguetown
, he was on the verge of arresting Luffy during their first encounter, and would have succeeded had it not been for Luffy's father,
Monkey D. Dragon
, interfering.
As a result, Luffy resorted to running away from Smoker every time he spotted him due to not yet knowing how to use
Armament Haki
.
After the
Enies Lobby
events, Smoker was shown unsatisfied in capturing a pirate with a bounty of
50,000,000 and already considered moving to the
New World
.
During the
Summit War of Marineford
, he again defeated Luffy, who was already a
supernova
, effortlessly and could have captured him, if
Hancock
had not interfered.
By the end of the Summit War of Marineford, Smoker's overall strength had granted him enough confidence to request a transfer to the
G-5
Marine Branch in the New World. It was said that the soldiers of this branch were insane, cruel, and merciless, regularly torturing pirates through various methods. They were known for not following orders, but Smoker, who is very much similar, managed to earn their loyalty and obedience, to the point of worship.
With
Vergo
's treason and death, Smoker took over as base commander, effectively becoming the highest authority within the branch.
Smoker's skills in pursuing and ensnaring enemies are regarded as top-notch, being the source of his "White Hunter" moniker. Luffy being the first person to ever escape his clutches is what causes him to fearlessly tackle more dangerous seas.
After the timeskip, Smoker and his crew managed to capture several pirates who were liberated from
Hody
's control at once.
During his time on
Punk Hazard
, he managed to give
Trafalgar Law
, a Warlord of the Sea and part of the
Worst Generation
, a hard time in combat before he was ultimately defeated.
He also fought fellow his fellow vice admiral,
Vergo
, who is also one of the strongest members of the
Donquixote Pirates
, on relatively equal terms, despite Vergo's superior mastery of Haki, although in the end he was defeated.
Even after having his mind switched to
Tashigi
's body, Smoker managed to strike Luffy, surprising the Straw Hat captain, who wondered how "Tashigi" had gotten so strong since two years ago. Also, despite not being in his original body, Smoker easily defeated some of
Caesar
’s subordinates through his normal skills alone.
Smoker has both excellent hearing and memory, best shown during the
Arabasta Arc
, where he was able to identify a certain
Bananawani
from a whole pack solely by memorizing its growl. While he may not look like it, Smoker is a clever and intelligent interrogator, easily tricking
Mr. 11
into revealing his affiliation to
Baroque Works
through deceit. Being highly observant, Smoker was the only one who noticed the unusual icebergs that blocked their path during their trip to Punk Hazard, and was suspicious of the ever present gas that lingers around the island, both of which were being manipulated by the enemy. As a leader and strategist, Smoker is extremely efficient at his job, mobilizing his forces in a clear and concise manner during times of crisis.
Physical Abilities
[
]
As evident by his strong build, Smoker possesses incredible physical strength. During his confrontation with Luffy in Loguetown, he was able to jump about two stories high without difficulty while holding the pirate and pin him down so that unable to retaliate, a noteworthy feat considering Luffy's superhuman physical power.
He also has vast durability and resistance. Smoker was able to stand back up with no visible damage and without effort after receiving a Haki-enhanced kick from Boa Hancock, whose attacks were strong enough to shatter stone and
Pacifista
armor (though Hancock's kick was primarily to get him off of Luffy).
After the timeskip, Smoker's physical strength has become significantly more powerful, being able to grab Law's neck with one hand, slice through a rock twice his size with a single blow, and elbow blood out of his partner, Vergo. His stamina and durability also improved as he can take a lot of Vergo's Haki-enhanced hits and keep fighting.
Devil Fruit
[
]
Further information:
Moku Moku no Mi
Smoker uses the Moku Moku no Mi.
Smoker ate the Moku Moku no Mi, a
Logia
-type
Devil Fruit
that allows him to create, control and transform his body into smoke. He can manipulate the smoke's density, even to the point of solidifying it, allowing him to hold and constrict others within it. Like most Logia users, he can fly by turning his lower body into smoke and propelling himself like a rocket.
He can use his smoke to surround his opponents to trap and/or bind them. Due to smoke being a gas, it has high maneuverability and irregular movements, allowing him to easily cover the battlefield in smoke as his opponents pointlessly try to escape it. Once his smoke is surrounding his enemies, he can increase its density, turning it solid and restraining his victims.
He can also use his smoke as a blunt weapon. He can shoot powerful jets of smoke at his opponents to strike them with great force.
Using his smoke powers, Smoker can power up the engines of his motorbike, the
Billower Bike
, for ground transportation.
Weapons
[
]
Nanashaku Jitte
[
]
Further information:
Nanashaku Jitte
Smoker's jitte strapped to his back.
Smoker's main weapon is a large
jitte
that is tipped with
Seastone
, a material that affects Devil Fruit users in a similar way to the sea, which he uses to subdue criminal Devil Fruit users.
Since only the tip is Seastone, it does not affect Smoker himself. He keeps the tip hanging in the air at all times, and his thick clothing provides further protection. When he turns into smoke, the weapon does not turn into smoke with him because of the Seastone. Instead, he carries it with him while in smoke form.
Smoker seems to be very proficient in wielding the jitte, taking enemies by surprise and using the weapon to deliver strong blunt attacks. The jitte was broken in half when Boa Hancock kicked it, which led it to crumble. After the timeskip, the jitte has shown to have been repaired. Its hilt is white in the manga, but red in the anime. Also, in the manga and its related merchandise and products, it seems to be much longer than in the anime, almost reaching down to Smoker's feet.

The Billower Bike is used for ground transportation. It is a wide bike with three wheels (two large ones at the rear, and a smaller one in front) and its engines are powered by his

powers. Additionally, Smoker can traverse water with the bike.

Before the timeskip, Smoker was not able to use Haki, although he had some knowledge of it. This put him at a disadvantage against the Warlord of the Sea Boa Hancock, who had mastery of the ability and could counter his Logia nature.
During the timeskip, Smoker was promoted to vice admiral, confirming that he can use the ability.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Appearance
[
]
In the manga, his hair color is pure white; the anime initially tinted it a greenish-grey color, but changed to match the manga from the
Punk Hazard Arc
on. His jacket's fur trim also differs between mediums, with the manga portraying it as a bluish color and the anime a deep green; in this case, the manga eventually changed its color scheme to follow the anime.

Additionally, his cigar-bands are labeled "MARINE" in the manga, implying they come from a specialty supplier. This, like most of the manga's small-print details, is omitted from the anime.
Loguetown Arc
[
]
Young Smoker witnesses
Gold Roger
's execution, as seen in the anime.
In the anime, the subplot on Smoker's backstory he mentions about Gold Roger is expanded on in Loguetown, showing that he was at Roger's execution when he was a child.
However, in the manga, Smoker's comments on Roger were merely just a passing comment and only Roger's face is seen.
Instead of learning about Luffy when he was about to be executed by Buggy and Alvida,
Smoker learns about him earlier. He is informed that some pirates are creating havoc in the harbor. Thinking that this crew is the Straw Hat Pirates, Smoker goes to investigate. There he finds an elderly pirate called
Crescent Moon Gally
who has a bounty of 3,450,000. He and his crew are seen raiding buildings at Loguetown before being captured, however he is notably disappointed when he finds out that Gally was not the man he was looking for. Luffy then appears and asks Smoker where the execution gallows are. Using his smoke, he guides Luffy to the gallows without having any idea who he was. It wasn't until he was in
Raoul
's bar that he figured out who the boy he helped was. He raced through town to the gallows to intercept and challenge him. Even without using his Devil Fruit powers, Smoker manages to gain the upper hand against Luffy, who then manages to accidentally send himself flying into another part of town.
Later,
Daddy Masterson
is seen talking to then-Captain Smoker and asking him to sign a release. Smoker asks him about his daughter and claims it is sad how the Marines' best sniper is reduced to a common bounty hunter. Just as he is about to leave, Smoker tells him to say hi to Carol for him at which Daddy replies; "I'll tell her Uncle Smoker said hello." Immediately after he leaves the room Tashigi asks him if the man was Daddy Masterson and Smoker replies with great praise and from there he refers to him as an equal.
In the anime during the race back to the Going Merry, Luffy fights Smoker alone and the Marines attack the ship forcing Nami to pull the Going Merry away from the docks. Sanji's role is placed here rather than the fight with Smoker as he fights the Marines attacking the ship.
Jitte
[
]
During
Episode 488
, Smoker was shown using his jitte, even though Hancock had destroyed it earlier.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
Per its standard editing policies, the
4Kids-dubbed anime
- in addition to renaming him
Chaser
- removes all of his cigars and the "justice"
(
正義
,
Seigi
?
)
kanji on his jacket; however, it usually leaves the smoke-trails around his face unedited, excusing them as a side-effect of his abilities. Localizations of contemporary video games such as
Grand Battle!
and
Unlimited Adventure
typically leave his jacket unedited as well, removing only his in-use cigars.
4Kids' adaptation of the
Loguetown Arc
similarly censors his alcohol preferences, having him raid
Raoul
's bar for "power juice" rather than rum.
Finally, 4Kids' localization of
Pirates Carnival
uses him to host a mini-game originally hosted by
Paulie
(as it had made no preparations for dubbing the
Water 7 Arc
), his smoke abilities substituting for Paulie's
Rope Action
. The mini-game's overall setup - to
retrieve several suitcases
from a lumberyard - is unchanged, apart from the lumberyard's
Dock 1
label being painted over with a "NAVY" emblem.
