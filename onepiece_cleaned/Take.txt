Abilities and Powers

Being a Fish-Man, Take has incredible mobility underwater as well as the ability to stay submerged for as long as he desires. Like his entire race, he is also much stronger than an average human being. Despite these advantages, he is actually quite weak in comparison to strong adversaries such as the Straw Hat Pirates, especially when he and his crewmates were swept aside easily when
Monkey D. Luffy
swung
Momoo
around.

When
Pudding Pudding
and his subordinates arrived at the Conomi Islands to arrest Arlong,
Hatchan
,
Chew
and
Kuroobi

Shioyaki
commented that the Marines would be surprised and overwhelmed by the three Officers. Their prediction was correct; the Officers quickly defeated the Marines and sunk their ship.
