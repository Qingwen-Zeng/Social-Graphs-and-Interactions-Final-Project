Owing to its apparent reputation and status as a carnivore, the Ear God likely showed no regard for the lives of those within the Land of Gods.

When two townsfolk heard a rumor that the Ear God collapsed, they were shocked and wondered who could have pulled off a feat they considered impossible.
With its sharpened teeth and large size, it was capable of devouring most smaller foes with ease. According to Road, its carnivorous nature made it a tough opponent.

The Ear God encountered
Monkey D. Luffy
soon after he arrived in the Land of Gods, who killed it before being joined by
Zoro
and
Sanji
. Sanji roasted its meat, which the trio ate.
Its collapse caused a rumble in the forest felt by several people.
Its charred remains were later found near the town by the Land of Gods' residents, causing delays in their regular duties.
When its owner

arrived, he was shocked to see its remains, but laughed it off when he considered how entertaining the situation was.
