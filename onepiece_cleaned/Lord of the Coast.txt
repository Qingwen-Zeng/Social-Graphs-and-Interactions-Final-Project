The
Lord of the Coast
is a
Sea King
that inhabits the waters of
Dawn Island
, typically near
Foosha Village
.
He is classified as a Type C creature, "Big Savage".
Appearance
[
]
The Lord of the Coast is fairly small in size compared to other Sea Kings.
However, he is still large enough to swallow a grown man whole.
His appearance is similar to a large oversized brown eel with red eyes and blue fins. These eyes become bloodshot and the pupils turn catlike when it goes into a berserk frenzy.
Personality
[
]
The Lord of the Coast is very aggressive and fierce in nature, preying on humans on multiple occasions.
In the creature classification, he is considered even more savage than a typical Sea King.
Abilities and Powers
[
]
Being a Sea King, the Lord of the Coast is naturally a very vicious and dangerous predator, as well as a powerful swimmer. His speed and strength in water are so great that even a famous and powerful pirate like Shanks had to sacrifice his arm to prevent the beast from devouring Luffy. However, his will is weak enough to be affected by Shanks'
Supreme King Haki
, having been intimidated by him. He was also defeated in one hit by the grown-up Luffy.
History

story.
Past
[

When Luffy and
Uta
challenged each other on a paddle race in barrels, they reached towards a rock, but they actually encountered the Lord of the Coast and quickly began paddling away. The Lord of the Coast did not notice the two children as it was too busy eating a fish.

Romance Dawn Arc

Higuma meets his demise.
When the
bandit
Higuma
kidnapped a seven-year-old
Monkey D. Luffy
and threw him into the sea, the Lord of the Coast was attracted by the noise, and quickly swallowed Higuma. He then tried to eat Luffy, but was intercepted by
Shanks
; while he managed to bite off Shanks' left arm in the process, the veteran pirate's
sheer force of will
intimidated him, and drove him to flee.
Ten years later, when Luffy left
Foosha Village
to start his journey as a pirate, the Lord of the Coast tried to eat him again, and was promptly knocked out with a
Gomu Gomu no Pistol
.

Anime and Manga Differences
[
]
Initially, the anime skipped Luffy's "rematch" with the Lord of the Coast, as Luffy's past was consigned to a flashback that was somewhat shorter than the corresponding manga chapter.
However, the scene was adapted into both the
anime's first opening
and
Grand Battle! Rush!
's opening cinematic.
The scene was finally adapted into the anime proper in
Episode 504
, and most subsequent adaptations of Luffy's backstory (such as
Episode 878
). These usually choreograph the scene to be closer to the manga, with Luffy raising one foot in the air and holding his right arm with his left.
Translation and Dub Issues
[
]
The
VIZ
manga does not treat 近海の主
(
Kinkai no nushi
?
)
as a name or
epithet
, instead translating it as "our local sea monster"; the
Funimation simulcast
of the anime (as well as Shueisha's English edition of the 7th
popularity poll
) follows this convention.
The creature's 'official' English name,
Master of the Near Sea
, has been established only by video games—first by the American-produced
One Piece
, and subsequently by the localization of
One Piece Treasure Cruise
. However, a newer unit in
Treasure Cruise
uses the label "Local Sea Monster".
The
live-action series
is the first official content that uses the translation "
Lord of the Coast
".
