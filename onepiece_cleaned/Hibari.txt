Final Saga
[
]
Egghead Arc
[
]
At some point after Koby's abduction by the
Blackbeard Pirates
, Hibari and
Helmeppo
approached and pleaded with
Prince Grus
to rescue Koby at
Hachinosu
. However, her requests were deemed unreasonable by Grus, who told her to stay calm.
She and Helmeppo went aboard
Monkey D. Garp
's ship in their mission to rescue Koby.
She later joined the
SWORD
's members on the ground ambushing the Blackbeard Pirates on Hachinosu, spotting Koby before shooting with a rifle loaded with
Flower Bullets
at the pirates, turning their guns' ammo into flowers.
Hibari is frozen by Kuzan.
After they defeated the pirates in front of them, Hibari escorted Koby to Garp but was unable to open Koby's shackles. She was then, to the shock of everybody present,
frozen
by
Kuzan
.
Hibari survived due to
Tashigi
and the other Marines defrosting the ice. She asked about Koby and apologized for being a nuisance.
Kujaku
reassured Hibari that Koby and the others will come back while expressing relief of her welfare as she comforted Hibari.
When
Avalo Pizarro
threatened to crush the Marines' ship, Hibari watched in fear as Koby prepared to stop the
giant hand
by himself. However, Koby succeeded in destroying the hand, saving the ship and the Marines. After Helmeppo brought Koby back to the ship, Hibari hugged Koby while the other Marines cheered for him. Garp then called the ship and ordered them to escape without him, much to the shock of the other Marines.
Hibari recovers alongside her allies.
Sometime later, the group went to the
Marine GS General Hospital
for medical attention. During their stay, they listened to
Vegapunk
's worldwide broadcast, with Hibari commenting about the sheer amount of information being revealed.
