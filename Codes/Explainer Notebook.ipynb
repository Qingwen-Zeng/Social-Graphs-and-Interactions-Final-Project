    "# One Piece Network Analysis Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to analyze the characters and relationships in the *One Piece* series through a combination of network analysis and sentiment analysis. The project is structured around the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**  \n",
    "   - Extract content related to *One Piece* characters from the official *One Piece* Wiki.  \n",
    "   - Process and clean the data to remove unnecessary HTML tags, creating plain text files for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Character Filtering**  \n",
    "   - Implement a filtering mechanism using a custom \"score\" metric to identify the most important characters in the series.  \n",
    "   - Ensure a manageable dataset that focuses on relevant entities for subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Network Construction and Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Develop internal networks representing relationships within specific story arcs of *One Piece*.  \n",
    "   - Build external networks to track changes and dynamics across different arcs, enabling temporal analysis of the series' narrative structure.  \n",
    "   - Create a complete network to visualize and analyze the overarching structure of *One Piece*.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community Detection and Advanced Metrics**  \n",
    "   - Partition the network into communities to understand clusters of characters and their interactions.  \n",
    "   - Perform TF-IDF analyse to quantify the roles and significance of these communities within the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sentiment Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Perform sentiment analysis on key characters to study their emotional tone and its evolution throughout the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visualization and Reporting**  \n",
    "   - Generate visualizations of the networks and analysis results for better understanding and presentation.  \n",
    "   - Include figures and charts in the project report to illustrate findings effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
