    "To prune characters effectively using the three metrics (**in-mentions**, **word count**, and **out-mentions**), we can adopt ranking strategies that prioritize **in-mentions** and **word count** while still accounting for **out-mentions**. Below are some approaches to solve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Option 1: Weighted Scoring**\n",
    "Assign weights to each metric based on its importance. Compute a total score for each character, and filter characters based on their scores:\n",
    "1. **Define Weights**:\n",
    "   - Assign higher weights to **in-mentions** and **word count** compared to **out-mentions**.\n",
    "   - Example: `in-mentions = 0.4`, `word count = 0.4`, `out-mentions = 0.2`.\n",
    "2. **Score Formula**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   score = 0.4 * normalized_in_mentions + 0.4 * normalized_word_count + 0.2 * normalized_out_mentions\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Normalize the values to a range of `[0, 1]` using min-max scaling:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   normalized_value = (value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Sort and Filter**:\n",
    "   - Rank characters by their scores and prune based on a threshold or keep the top N characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Option 2: Multi-Metric Ranking**\n",
    "Rank characters separately by each metric and combine their rankings to create a composite rank:\n",
    "1. **Rank by Each Metric**:\n",
    "   - Create three sorted lists: \n",
    "     - By **in-mentions** (descending).\n",
    "     - By **word count** (descending).\n",
    "     - By **out-mentions** (descending).\n",
    "   - Assign a rank to each character for each metric.\n",
    "2. **Weighted Rank Sum**:\n",
    "   - Compute a combined rank for each character using weights (e.g., `in-mentions_rank * 0.4 + word_count_rank * 0.4 + out_mentions_rank * 0.2`).\n",
    "3. **Filter**:\n",
    "   - Keep characters with the lowest combined ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Option 3: Pareto Optimal Filtering**\n",
    "Use a **Pareto frontier approach** to retain characters that are optimal with respect to the three metrics:\n",
    "1. **Pareto Principle**:\n",
    "   - A character is considered \"better\" if no other character outperforms it in all three metrics.\n",
    "2. **Filter with Thresholds**:\n",
    "   - Define a threshold for each metric (e.g., `in-mentions > 3`, `word count > 50`) and retain only characters satisfying these thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Option 4: Custom Rule-Based Filtering**\n",
    "Define a set of rules to prune characters explicitly based on your priorities:\n",
    "1. **Rules**:\n",
    "   - Retain characters with **in-mentions > X** or **word count > Y** regardless of their out-mentions.\n",
    "   - Optionally, remove characters with **out-mentions < Z**.\n",
    "2. **Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Iterate through the dictionary, applying the rules and removing characters that fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Choose?**\n",
    "- **Weighted Scoring**: Flexible and provides a continuous score. Good if you want to rank characters and pick the top ones.\n",
    "- **Multi-Metric Ranking**: Provides transparency in how rankings are combined. Better if you want to understand relative importance.\n",
    "- **Pareto Filtering**: Useful for retaining the \"best\" characters without predefined thresholds. May require manual inspection of results.\n",
    "- **Rule-Based Filtering**: Simple and fast if you know specific thresholds for pruning.\n",

    "---\n",

    "   - Retains characters that cannot be strictly outperformed on all metrics by others.\n",
    "   - Tends to keep a diverse set of \"strong\" characters.\n",

    "   - Removes characters that fall below the 90th percentile in **all** metrics.\n",
    "   - Adjustable by changing the `percentile` parameter (e.g., to 85% or 95%).\n"
